          Correlated mid-infrared and X-ray outbursts in black hole X-ray binaries: A new route to discovery in infrared surveys

 - **Abstract**
 The mid-infrared (MIR; $\lambda\simeq3 - 10\mu$m) bands offer a unique window into understanding accretion and its interplay with jet formation in Galactic black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs). Although extremely difficult to observe from the ground, the NEOWISE time domain survey offers an excellent data set to study MIR variability when combined with contemporaneous X-ray data from the MAXI all-sky survey over a $\approx15$ yr baseline. Using a new forced photometry pipeline for NEOWISE data, we present the first systematic study of BHXRB MIR variability in outburst. Analyzing a sample of 16 sources detected in NEOWISE, we show variability trends in the X-ray hardness and MIR spectral index wherein i) the MIR bands are typically dominated by jet emission during the hard states, constraining the electron power spectrum index to $p \approx 1-4$ in the optically thin regime and indicating emitting regions of a few tens of gravitational radii when evolving towards a flat spectrum, ii) the MIR luminosity ($L_{IR}$) scales as $L_{IR}\propto L_X^{0.82\pm0.12}$ with the $2-10$ keV X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) in the hard state, consistent with its origin in a jet, and iii) the thermal disk emission dominates the soft state as the jet switches off and dramatically suppresses ($\gtrsim 10\times$) the MIR emission into a inverted spectrum ($\alpha\approx -1$, where $F_\nu\propto\nu^{-\alpha}$). We highlight a population of `mini' BHXRB outbursts detected in NEOWISE (including two previously unreported episodes in MAXI J1828-249) but missed in MAXI due to their faint fluxes or source confusion, exhibiting MIR spectral indices suggestive of thermal emission from a large outer disk. We highlight that upcoming IR surveys and the Rubin observatory will be powerful discovery engines for the distinctively large amplitude and long-lived outbursts of BHXRBs, as an independent discovery route to X-ray monitors.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cepheid AW Per is a component in a multiple system with a long period orbit. The radial velocities of Griffin (2016) cover the 38 year orbit well. An extensive program of interferometry with the CHARA array is reported here, from which the long period orbit is determined. In addition, a {\it Hubble Space Telescope} high resolution spectrum in the ultraviolet demonstrates that the companion is itself a binary with nearly equal mass components. These data combined with a distance from {\it Gaia} provide a mass of the Cepheid (primary) of M$_1$ = 6.79 $\pm$ 0.85 $M_\odot$. The combined mass of the secondary is M$_S$ = 8.79 $\pm$ 0.50 $M_\odot$. The accuracy of the mass will be improved after the fourth Gaia data release expected in approximately two years.

 - **Abstract**
 The newly installed Silmaril beam combiner at the CHARA array is designed to observe previously inaccessible faint targets, including Active Galactic Nuclei and T-Tauri Young Stellar Objects. Silmaril leverages cutting-edge optical design, low readout noise, and a high-speed C-RED1 camera to realize its sensitivity objectives. In this presentation, we offer a comprehensive overview of the instrument's software, which manages critical functions, including camera data acquisition, fringe tracking, automatic instrument alignment, and observing interfaces, all aimed at optimizing on-sky data collection. Additionally, we offer an outline of the data reduction pipeline, responsible for converting raw instrument data products into the final OIFITS used by the standard interferometry modeling software. The purpose of this paper is to provide a solid reference for studies based on Silmaril data.

 - **Abstract**
 Mass-loss and radiation feedback from evolving massive stars produce galactic-scale superwinds, sometimes surrounded by pressure-driven bubbles. Using the time-dependent stellar population typically seen in star-forming regions, we conduct hydrodynamic simulations of a starburst-driven superwind model coupled with radiative efficiency rates to investigate the formation of radiative cooling superwinds and bubbles. Our numerical simulations depict the parameter space where radiative cooling superwinds with or without bubbles occur. Moreover, we employ the physical properties and time-dependent ionization states to predict emission line profiles under the assumption of collisional ionization and non-equilibrium ionization caused by wind thermal feedback in addition to photoionization created by the radiation background. We see the dependence of non-equilibrium ionization structures on the time-evolving ionizing source, leading to a deviation from collisional ionization in radiative cooling wind regions over time.

          On the lack of X-ray pulsation in most neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries

 - **Abstract**
 We have investigated whether the lack of X-ray pulsations from most neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) could be due to the extension of their inner disc to the NS surface. To estimate the inner disc radii, we have employed the model, recently proposed to account for the torque reversals of LMXBs. In this model, the inner disc radius depends on the spin period as well as the dipole moment and the mass inflow rate of the disc. Our model results indicate that most LMXBs have mass accretion rates above the minimum critical rates required for the inner disc to reach down to the NS surface and thereby quench the pulsed X-ray emission. For most sources X-ray pulsations are allowed when the period decreases below a certain critical value. For the same parameters, the model is also consistent with the observed X-ray luminosity ranges of the individual accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars (AMXPs). The paucity of AMXPs compared to the majority population of non-pulsing LMXBs is explained, as well as the fact that AMXPs are transient sources.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we study the flux density dependence of the redshift distribution of low-frequency radio sources observed in the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) deep fields and apply it to estimate the clustering length of the large-scale structure of the Universe, examining flux density limited samples (1 mJy, 2 mJy, 4 mJy and 8 mJy) of LoTSS wide field radio sources. We utilise and combine the posterior probability distributions of photometric redshift determinations for LoTSS deep field observations from three different fields (Boötes, Lockman hole and ELAIS-N1, together about $26$ square degrees of sky), which are available for between $91\%$ to $96\%$ of all sources above the studied flux density thresholds and observed in the area covered by multi-frequency data. We estimate uncertainties by a bootstrap method. We apply the inferred redshift distribution on the LoTSS wide area radio sources from the HETDEX field (LoTSS-DR1; about $424$ square degrees) and make use of the Limber approximation and a power-law model of three dimensional clustering to measure the clustering length, $r_0$, for various models of the evolution of clustering. We find that the redshift distributions from all three LoTSS deep fields agree within expected uncertainties. We show that the radio source population probed by LoTSS at flux densities above $1$ mJy has a median redshift of at least $0.9$. At $2$ mJy, we measure the clustering length of LoTSS radio sources to be $r_0 = (10.1\pm 2.6) \ h^{-1}$Mpc in the context of the comoving clustering model. Our findings are in agreement with measurements at higher flux density thresholds at the same frequency and with measurements at higher frequencies in the context of the comoving clustering model.

 - **Abstract**
 Disk vortices, seen in numerical simulations of protoplanetary disks and found observationally in ALMA and VLA images of these objects, are promising sites for planet formation given their pebble trapping abilities. Previous works have shown strong concentration of pebbles in vortices, but gravitational collapse has only been shown in low-resolution, two-dimensional, global models. In this letter, we aim to study the pebble concentration and gravitational collapse of pebble clouds in vortices via high-resolution, three-dimensional, local models. We performed simulations of the dynamics of gas and solids in a local shearing box where the gas is subject to convective overstability, generating a persistent giant vortex. We find that the vortex produces objects of Moon and Mars mass, with mass function of power law $d\ln N/d\ln M=-1.6\pm 0.3$. The protoplanets grow rapidly, doubling in mass in about 5 orbits, following pebble accretion rates. The mass range and mass doubling rate are in broad agreement with previous low resolution global models. We conclude that Mars-mass planetary embryos are the natural outcome of planet formation inside the disk vortices seen in millimeter and radio images of protoplanetary disks.

          Links Between Optical and X-ray Light in Cygnus X-2

 - **Abstract**
 We observed the low mass X-ray binary Cyg X-2 for a total of 18 nights over two observing runs in July and September of 2006, using the Otto Struve Telescope at McDonald Observatory and the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. Using discrete cross correlations, we found peaks occurring at near-zero lags in the flaring branch of the colour-colour diagram, which could signify reprocessing, in addition to an anti-correlation within the normal branch. When comparing optical flux to the system's placement on the Z track, two distinct behaviors were seen: (1) a state with no correlation, and (2) a multi-valued (horizontal and normal branches)/correlated (flaring branch) state. The correlation was the result of direct steps and more gradual falls to and from the flaring branch respectively. Finally, we modeled timed spectra with 64 second bins with an extended accretion disc corona model. We found that correlations occurred between the optical and the various fitted parameters, particularly the blackbody normalization (and blackbody radius by extension) in higher intensity regions. Despite this, the Z track location was found to be a far better predictor of physical parameters than the optical flux, with clean correlations seen in every branch of the Z track. Where optical correlations are found, the location on the Z track was a better predictor of optical flux than any individual physical parameter.

 - **Abstract**
 The Dragonfly Spectral Line Mapper is an innovative all-refracting telescope designed to carry out ultra-low surface brightness wide-field mapping of visible wavelength line emission. Equipped with ultranarrowband (0.8 nm bandwidth) filters mounted in Dragonfly Filter-Tilter instrumentation, the Dragonfly Spectral Line Mapper maps H$\alpha$, [NII]$\lambda$6583, and [OIII]$\lambda$5007 line emission produced by structures with sizes ranging from $\sim$1 to 1000 kpc in the local Universe. These spatial scales encompass that of the exceedingly diffuse and faintly radiating circumgalactic medium, which is singularly difficult to detect with conventional mirror-based telescope instrumentation. Extremely careful control of systematics is required to directly image these large scale structures, necessitating high fidelity sky background subtraction, wavelength calibration, and specialized flat-fielding methods. In this paper, we discuss the on-sky performance of the Dragonfly Spectral Line Mapper with these methods in place.

          A high-resolution imaging survey of massive young stellar objects in the Magellanic Clouds

 - **Abstract**
 Constraints on the binary fraction of young massive stellar objects (mYSOs) are important for binary and massive star formation theory. Here, we present speckle imaging of 34 mYSOs located in the Large (1/2 $Z_{\odot}$) and Small Magellanic Clouds ($\sim$1/5 $Z_{\odot}$), probing projected separations between the 2000-20000 au (at angular scales of 0.02-0.2") range, for stars above 8 $M_{\odot}$. We find two wide binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud (from a sample of 23 targets), but none in a sample of 11 in the Small Magellanic Cloud, leading us to adopt a wide binary fraction of 9$\pm$5%, and $<$5%, respectively. We rule out a wide binary fraction greater than 35% in the Large, and 38% in the Small Magellanic Cloud at the 99% confidence level. This is in contrast to the wide binary fraction of mYSOs in the Milky Way (presumed $Z_{\odot}$), which within the physical parameter space probed by this study is $\sim$15-60% from the literature. We argue that while selection effects could be responsible for the lower binary fraction observed; it is more likely that there are underlying physical mechanisms responsible for the observed properties. This indicates that metallicity and environmental effects may influence the formation of wide binaries among massive stars. Future larger, statistically more significant samples of high-mass systems in low-metallicity environments, and for comparison in the Milky Way, are essential to confirm or repudiate our claim.

          NEOWISE-R Caught the Luminous SN 2023ixf in Messier 101

 - **Abstract**
 The reactivated Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE-R) serendipitously caught the Type II supernova SN 2023ixf in Messier 101 on the rise, starting day 3.6 through day 10.9, and on the late-time decline from days 211 through 213 and days 370 through 372. We have considered these mid-infrared (mid-IR) data together with observations from the ultraviolet (UV) through the near-IR, when possible. At day 3.6 we approximated the optical emission with a hot, ~26,630 K blackbody, with a notable UV excess likely from strong SN shock interaction with circumstellar matter (CSM). In the IR, however, a clear excess is also obvious, and we fit it with a cooler, ~1,620 K blackbody with radius of ~2.6 x 10^{15} cm, consistent with dust in the progenitor's circumstellar shell likely heated by the UV emission from the CSM interaction. On day 10.8, the light detected was consistent with SN ejecta-dominated emission. At late times we also observed a clear NEOWISE-R excess, which could arise either from newly formed dust in the inner ejecta or in the contact discontinuity between the forward and reverse shocks, or from more distant pre-existing dust grains in the SN environment. Furthermore, the large 4.6 micron excess at late times can also be explained by the emergence of the carbon monoxide 1--0 vibrational band. SN 2023ixf is the best-observed SN IIP in the mid-IR during the first several days after explosion and one of the most luminous such SNe ever seen.

          Linear adiabatic analysis for general relativistic instability in primordial accreting supermassive stars

 - **Abstract**
 Accreting supermassive stars of $\gtrsim 10^{5}\,M_\odot$ will eventually collapse directly to a black hole via the general relativistic (GR) instability. Such direct collapses of supermassive stars are thought to be a possible formation channel for supermassive black holes at $z > 6$. In this work, we investigate the final mass of accreting Population III stars with constant accretion rates between $0.01$ and $1000\,M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. We determine the final mass by solving the differential equation for the general relativistic linear adiabatic radial pulsations. We find that models with accretion rates $\gtrsim 0.05\,M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ experience the GR instability at masses depending on the accretion rates. The critical masses are larger for higher accretion rates, ranging from $8\times10^{4}\,M_\odot$ for $0.05\,M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ to $\sim10^6\,M_\odot$ for $1000\,M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. The $0.05\,M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ model reaches the GR instability at the end of the core hydrogen burning. The higher mass models with the higher accretion rates reach the GR instability during the hydrogen burning stage.

          X-ray observations of black hole sources

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray astronomy is closely related to the study of black hole sources. The discovery that some unseen objects, more massive than any degenerate star, emit huge amounts of X-rays helped accept the concept that back holes are present in X-ray binaries. The detection of copious amounts of highly variable X-rays helped the emergence of the paradigm that all Active Galactic Nuclei harboured a supermassive black hole. Since the bulk of the emission in these sources are in X-rays and X-rays are thought to be originating from regions closest to the black holes, it was expected that X-ray observations would yield significant inputs for our understanding of the physical phenomena happening close to black holes like the disk-jet connection and help measure many important parameters like the mass and spin of the black holes. I will trace the developments in this area for the past several decades and, noting the relatively limited success, stress the need for more sensitive measurements. I will highlight the recent X-ray polarisation measurements of the Galactic black hole candidate source Cygnus X-1 using the CZT Imager instrument of AstroSat and sketch possible future developments.

          Observational Evidence to Logistic Dark Energy Driving the Accelerating Universe

 - **Abstract**
 We present logistic dark energy model (LDEM), where the dark energy density follows a logistic function for the scale factor. The equation of state parameter of dark energy ($w_D$) transitioned from $-1$ in the distant past to its current value of $-0.76$, closely resembling the $\Lambda$CDM model in the early epoch and showing significant deviation in the late phase. The evolution of the deceleration parameter in the LDEM signifies its success in explaining the late-time cosmic acceleration. Model selection based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), incorporating observations from Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), Observational Hubble data (OHD), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) strongly favors the LDEM over the conventional $\Lambda$CDM model, where BIC is estimated to be $\sim -20$. Incorporating the shift parameter derived from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data shows competing evidence of the LDEM over the standard $\Lambda$CDM. Remarkably, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) value computed using any of the datasets tends to align closely with the predictions from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), suggesting a need to reconsider the local measurement.

          Searching for the Signature of Fast Radio Burst by Swift/XRT X-ray Afterglow Light Curve

 - **Abstract**
 A new type of cosmological transient, dubbed fast radio bursts (FRBs), was recently discovered. The source of FRBs is still unknown. One possible scenario of an FRB is the collapse of a spinning supra-massive neutron star. Zhang (2014) suggests that the collapse can happen shortly (hundreds to thousands of seconds) after the birth of supra-massive neutron stars. The signatures can be visible in X-ray afterglows of long and short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). For instance, a sudden drop (decay index steeper than -3 to -9) from a shallow decay (decay index shallower than -1) in the X-ray afterglow flux can indicate the event. We selected the X-ray afterglow light curves with a steep decay after the shallow decay phase from the Swift/XRT GRB catalog. We analyzed when the decay index changed suddenly by fitting these light curves to double power-law functions and compared it with the onset of FRBs. We found none of our GRB samples match the onset of FRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 A peculiar subtype of Type Ia supernovae (SNe), 03fg-like (super-Chandrasekhar) SNe, show different observational properties from prototypical Type Ia SNe, typically having high luminosity at the light-curve peak, low expansion velocities, and strong carbon features. The origin of this class of Type Ia SNe has been actively debated. Recent nebular-phase infrared observations of the 03fg-like Type Ia SN 2022pul using the James Webb Space Telescope revealed large-scale asymmetries in the ejecta and the presence of the strong [Ne II] line at 12.81 $\mu$m, suggesting a violent merger of two white dwarfs as its origin. Polarimetry is another powerful tool to study overall ejecta asymmetries of spatially-unresolved SNe. Here, we aim to check the universality of the violent merger scenario as the origin of the 03fg-like Type Ia SNe, by studying their explosion geometries using polarimetry. In this letter, we present imaging-polarimetric observations of the two 03fg-like Type Ia SNe 2021zny and 2022ilv. SNe 2021zny and 2022ilv show high intrinsic polarization ($\sim1$ % -$\sim2$ %), which might be composed of multiple components with different polarization angles. This indicates that they have complex aspherical structures in their ejecta, supporting the violent merger scenario for their origin. Our observations provide the first clear evidence from polarimetry for such aspherical structures.

          A Potential Second Shutoff from AT2018fyk: An updated Orbital Ephemeris of the Surviving Star under the Repeating Partial Tidal Disruption Event Paradigm

 - **Abstract**
 The tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2018dyk/ASASSN-18UL showed a rapid dimming event 500 days after discovery, followed by a re-brightening roughly 700 days later. It has been hypothesized that this behavior results from a repeating partial TDE (rpTDE), such that prompt dimmings/shutoffs are coincident with the return of the star to pericenter and rebrightenings generated by the renewed supply of tidally stripped debris. This model predicted that the emission should shut off again around August of 2023. We report AT2018fyk's continued X-ray and UV monitoring, which shows an X-ray (UV) drop in flux by a factor of 10 (5) over a span of two months, starting 14 Aug 2023. This sudden change can be interpreted as the second emission shutoff, which 1) strengthens the rpTDE scenario for AT2018fyk, 2) allows us to constrain the orbital period to a more precise value of 1306$\pm$47 days, and 3) establishes that X-ray and UV/optical emission track the fallback rate onto this SMBH -- an often-made assumption that otherwise lacks observational verification -- and therefore the UV/optical lightcurve is powered predominantly by processes tied to X-rays. The second cutoff implies that another rebrightening should happen between May-Aug 2025, and if the star survived the second encounter, a third shutoff is predicted to occur between Jan-July 2027. Finally, low-level accretion from the less bound debris tail (which is completely unbound/does not contribute to accretion in a non-repeating TDE) can result in a faint X-ray plateau that could be detectable until the next rebrightening.

 - **Abstract**
 We have searched for anomalous events using 2,520 hours of archival observations from Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope. These observations were originally undertaken to search for pulsars. We used a machine learning algorithm based on ResNet and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) in order to identify parts of the data stream that potentially contain anomalous signals. Many of these anomalous events are radio frequency interference, which were subsequently filtered using multibeam information. We detected 202 anomalous events and provide their positions and event times. One of the events could potentially come from a white dwarf. Some of them may originate from stellar flares, lightning, or be true anomalies, which are currently of an unknown type.

 - **Abstract**
 PSR B1259-63 is a gamma-ray binary system that hosts a pulsar in an eccentric orbit, with a 3.4 year period, around an O9.5Ve star. At orbital phases close to periastron passages, the system radiates bright and variable non-thermal emission. We report on an extensive VHE observation campaign conducted with the High Energy Stereoscopic System, comprised of ~100 hours of data taken from $t_p-24$ days to $t_p+127$ days around the system's 2021 periastron passage. We also present the timing and spectral analyses of the source. The VHE light curve in 2021 is consistent with the stacked light curve of all previous observations. Within the light curve, we report a VHE maximum at times coincident with the third X-ray peak first detected in the 2021 X-ray light curve. In the light curve -- although sparsely sampled in this time period -- we see no VHE enhancement during the second disc crossing. In addition, we see no correspondence to the 2021 GeV flare in the VHE light curve. The VHE spectrum obtained from the analysis of the 2021 dataset is best described by a power law of spectral index $\Gamma = 2.65 \pm 0.04_{\text{stat}}$ $\pm 0.04_{\text{sys}}$, a value consistent with the previous H.E.S.S. observations of the source. We report spectral variability with a difference of $\Delta \Gamma = 0.56 ~\pm~ 0.18_{\text{stat}}$ $~\pm~0.10_{\text{sys}}$ at 95% c.l., between sub-periods of the 2021 dataset. We also find a linear correlation between contemporaneous flux values of X-ray and TeV datasets, detected mainly after $t_p+25$ days, suggesting a change in the available energy for non-thermal radiation processes. We detect no significant correlation between GeV and TeV flux points, within the uncertainties of the measurements, from $\sim t_p-23$ days to $\sim t_p+126$ days. This suggests that the GeV and TeV emission originate from different electron populations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the phase-connected timing solutions of all the five pulsars in globular cluster (GC) M3 (NGC 5272), namely PSRs M3A to F (PSRs J1342+2822A to F), with the exception of PSR M3C, from FAST archival data. In these timing solutions, those of PSRs M3E, and F are obtained for the first time. We find that PSRs M3E and F have low mass companions, and are in circular orbits with periods of 7.1 and 3.0 days, respectively. For PSR M3C, we have not detected it in all the 41 observations. We found no X-ray counterparts for these pulsars in archival Chandra images in the band of 0.2-20 keV. We noticed that the pulsars in M3 seem to be native. From the Auto-Correlation Function (ACF) analysis of the M3A's and M3B's dynamic spectra, the scintillation timescale ranges from $7.0\pm0.3$ min to $60.0\pm0.6$ min, and the scintillation bandwidth ranges from $4.6\pm0.2$ MHz to $57.1\pm1.1$ MHz. The measured scintillation bandwidths from the dynamic spectra indicate strong scintillation, and the scattering medium is anisotropic. From the secondary spectra, we captured a scintillation arc only for PSR M3B with a curvature of $649\pm23 {\rm m}^{-1} {\rm mHz}^{-2}$.

 - **Abstract**
 This work shows the results of an evaluation of the impact that a detector located in China, with a noise budget comparable to that of a proposed high-frequency detector with a 20 km arm length, an Einstein Telescope (ET) or a Cosmic Explorer (CE), could have on the network of ET-CE in terms of detection rate, localization, and providing early warning alert for simulated binary neutron star (BNS)s. The results indicate that a three-detector network including a Chinese detector could identify at least 4.4% more BNS mergers than an ET-CE network alone. The localization uncertainty could be reduced by a factor of more than 5 on average compared to the ET-CE network. With a three-detector network involving a Chinese detector, up to 89% of BNS mergers could be located within 10 square degrees of the sky 10 minutes prior to the merger. The assessment suggests that the potential for early warning signals is highest when the Chinese detector is similar to ET, whereas the sources are detected with the highest signal-to-noise ratio and localized to the smallest regions when the detector is more akin to CE. Interestingly, the C20N network (comprising ET+CE+C20) can achieve comparable localization performance as the ET network while outperforming the ETCN network (featuring the ET+CE+ an ET-like detector in China) in terms of detection capabilities, especially at large distances, indicating that adding a 20 km kilohertz detector in China to ET-CE network would make significant contributions at least as adding an ET-like detector in China to multi-messenger astronomy for almost all BNS observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) is the accumulated light produced throughout the universe history, spanning the UV, optical, and IR spectral ranges and mostly originating from stars, directly or re-processed by dust. However, measuring the EBL total intensity (beyond the contribution of resolved discrete sources) is challenging due to its faintness compared to foreground diffuse light like zodiacal light. A possible technique exploits the Very High Energy (VHE) photons coming from sources at cosmological distances. VHE photons can interact with the EBL and produce electron-positron pairs, a process that leaves an imprint in the observed gamma-ray spectrum. Determining the EBL with this method requires assumptions on the intrinsic spectrum of the source, which can affect the robustness of EBL constraints. In this contribution, through the use of Monte Carlo simulations, and archival data of the MAGIC telescopes, we have studied the impact that the assumptions so far adopted in the literature have in the estimates of the EBL density, and how the use of more generic ones would modify the results. These studies can impact our understanding of the evolution of the Universe, gamma-ray propagation, and large-scale structure formation.

          Measurement of Solar Differential Rotation by Absolutely Calibrated Iodine-Cell Spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 The iodine-cell technique, which is known to be efficient in precisely establishing Doppler velocity shifts, was once applied by the author to measuring the solar differential rotation based on full-disk spectroscopic observations (Takeda and Ueno, Sol. Phys. 270, 447, 2011). However, the data reduction procedure (in simple analogy with the stellar case) adopted therein was not necessarily adequate, because specific characteristic involved with the disk-resolved Sun (i.e., center-limb variation of line strengths) was not properly taken into consideration. Therefore, this problem is revisited based on the same data but with an application to theoretical spectrum fitting, which can yield absolute heliocentric radial velocities (v_obs) in a consistent manner as shown in the study of solar gravitational redshift (Takeda and Ueno, Sol. Phys. 281, 551, 2012). Likewise, instead of converting v_obs into omega (angular velocity) at each disk point, which suffers considerable errors especially near the central meridian, omega was derived this time by applying the least squares analysis to a dataset comprising v_obs values at many points. This new analysis resulted in omega (deg/day) = 13.92 (+/- 0.03) -1.69(+/- 0.34)(sin psi)^2 -2.37(+/- 0.62) (sin psi)^4 (psi: the heliographic latitude) along with the gravitational redshift of 675 m/s, which are favorably compared with previous publications. In addition, how the distribution of observing points on the disk affects the result is also examined, which reveals that rotation parameters may suffer appreciable errors depending on cases.

          The power of prediction: spatiotemporal Gaussian process modeling for predictive control in slope-based wavefront sensing

 - **Abstract**
 Time-delay error is a significant error source in adaptive optics (AO) systems. It arises from the latency between sensing the wavefront and applying the correction. Predictive control algorithms reduce the time-delay error, providing significant performance gains, especially for high-contrast imaging. However, the predictive controller's performance depends on factors such as the WFS type, the measurement noise, the AO system's geometry, and the atmospheric conditions. This work studies the limits of prediction under different imaging conditions through spatiotemporal Gaussian process models. The method provides a predictive reconstructor that is optimal in the least-squares sense, conditioned on the fixed times series of WFS data and our knowledge of the atmosphere. We demonstrate that knowledge is power in predictive AO control. With an SHS-based extreme AO instrument, perfect knowledge of Frozen Flow evolution (wind and Cn2 profile) leads to a reduction of the residual wavefront phase variance up to a factor of 3.5 compared to a non-predictive approach. If there is uncertainty in the profile or evolution models, the gain is more modest. Still, assuming that only effective wind speed is available (without direction) led to reductions in variance by a factor of 2.3. We also study the value of data for predictive filters by computing the experimental utility for different scenarios to answer questions such as: How many past data frames should the prediction filter consider, and is it always most advantageous to use the most recent data? We show that within the scenarios considered, more data consistently increases prediction accuracy. Further, we demonstrate that given a computational limitation on how many past frames we can use, an optimized selection of $n$ past frames leads to a 10-15% additional improvement in RMS over using the n latest consecutive frames of data.

          A model-independent determination of the sound horizon using recent BAO measurements and strong lensing systems

 - **Abstract**
 We propose an improved method to determine the sound horizon in a cosmological model-independent way by using the latest observations of BAO measurements from DES, BOSS/eBOSS, and DESI surveys and gravitationally time-delay lensed quasars from H0LiCOW collaboration. Combining the 6$D_{\Delta t}$ plus 4$D_{d}$ measurements and the reconstructed BAO datasets, we obtain a model-independent result of $r_d=139.7^{+5.2}_{-4.5}$ Mpc, with the precision at the $\sim3.7\%$ level, which is in agreement with the result of Planck 2018 within $\sim1.7\sigma$ uncertainty. Our method is independent of cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant, dark energy, (and, more importantly, does not involve the cosmic curvature when using the $D_d$ measurements of the lenses, and also avoids the obstacle of mass-sheet degeneracy in gravitational lensing). Meanwhile, it does not need to consider the Eddington relation with concerning the transformation of distance. Since only two types of data are considered, the contribution of each can be clearly understood. Our results also highlight the Hubble tension and may give us a better understanding of the discordance between the datasets or reveal new physics beyond the standard model.

 We present here the preliminary design of the RIZ module, one of the visible spectrographs of the ANDES instrument 1. It is a fiber-fed high-resolution, high-stability spectrograph. Its design follows the guidelines of successful predecessors such as HARPS and ESPRESSO. In this paper we present the status of the spectrograph at the preliminary design stage. The spectrograph will be a warm, vacuum-operated, thermally controlled and fiber-fed echelle spectrograph. Following the phase A design, the huge etendue of the telescope will be reformed in the instrument with a long slit made of smaller fibers. We discuss the system design of the spectrographs system.

 The Spectrograph of the RISTRETTO instrument is now currently being manufactured. RISTETTO is an instrument designed to detect and characterize the reflected light of nearby exoplanets. It combines high contrast imaging and high resolution spectroscopy to detect the light of exoplanets. The high resolution spectrograph subject of this paper uses the doppler effect to disentangle the planetary signal from the stellar light leaks. In this paper we describe the final design of the spectrograph and report the status of its construction. The RISTRETTO spectrograph has seven diffraction limited spaxels. The spectrograph's resolution is 130000 in the 620-840 nm band. It is designed in a similar way as HARPS and ESPRESSO, being a warm, thermally controlled spectrograph under vacuum. It is designed to be compact and self contained so that it could be installed on different telescopes. It is however tailored to be installed on a nasmyth platform of a VLT telescope. We present updates to the design and the manufacturing of the instrument. In particular we present the performance of the thermal enclosure.

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of large aperture arrays, such as the currently under construction Square Kilometer Array (SKA), allows for observing the universe in the radio-spectrum at unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. However, these telescopes produce data on the scale of exabytes, introducing a slew of hardware and software design challenges. This paper proposes a multi-step image reconstruction method that allows for partitioning visibility data by baseline length. This enables more flexible data distribution and parallelization, aiding in processing radio-astronomical observations within given constraints. The multi-step reconstruction is separated into two-steps, first reconstructing a low-resolution image with only short-baseline visibilities, and then using this image together with the long-baseline visibilities to reconstruct the full-resolution image. The proposed method only operates in the minor-cycle, and can be easily integrated into existing imaging pipelines. We show that our proposed method allows for partitioning visibilities by baseline without introducing significant additional drawbacks, having roughly the same computational cost and producing images of comparable quality to a method in the same framework that processes all baselines simultaneously.

 - **Abstract**
 Supervised machine learning models are increasingly being used for solving the problem of stellar classification of spectroscopic data. However, training such models requires a large number of labelled instances, the collection of which is usually costly in both time and expertise. This paper explores the application of active learning algorithms to sampling stellar spectra using data from a highly class-imbalanced dataset. We utilize the MaStar library from the SDSS DR17 along with its associated stellar parameter catalogue. Using different active learning algorithms, we iteratively select informative instances, where the model or committee of models exhibits the highest uncertainty or disagreement, respectively. We assess the effectiveness of the sampling techniques by comparing several performance metrics of supervised-learning models trained on the queried samples with randomly-sampled counterparts. Evaluation metrics include specificity, sensitivity, and the area under the curve, in addition to the Matthewś correlation coefficient, which offers a more-balanced assessment that considers all aspects of the confusion matrix, and is thus more suitable for use with imbalanced datasets. We apply this procedure to effective temperature, surface gravity, and iron metallicity, separately. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of active learning algorithms in selecting samples that produce performance metrics superior to random sampling and even stratified samples. We discuss the implications of the findings for prioritizing instance labelling of astronomical-survey data by experts or crowdsourcing to mitigate the high time cost.

          Surface parameterisation and spectral synthesis of rapidly rotating stars. Vega as a testbed

 - **Abstract**
 Spectral synthesis is a powerful tool with which to find the fundamental parameters of stars. Models are usually restricted to single values of temperature and gravity, and assume spherical symmetry. This approximation breaks down for rapidly rotating stars.This paper presents a joint formalism to allow a computation of the stellar structure, namely, the photospheric radius, the effective temperature, and gravity, as a function of the colatitude for rapid rotators with radiative envelopes, and a subsequent method to build the corresponding synthetic spectrum. The structure of the star is computed using a semi-analytical approach, which is easy to implement from a computational point of view and which reproduces very accurately the results of much more complex codes. Once R, T, and g are computed, the suite of code atlas and synthe, by R. Kurucz are used to synthesise spectra for a mesh of cells in which the star is divided. The appropriate limb-darkening coefficients are also computed, and the final output spectrum is built for a given inclination of the rotation axis with respect to the line of sight. All the geometrical transformations required are described in detail. The combined formalism has been applied to Vega, a rapidly rotating star almost seen pole-on, as a testbed. The structure reproduces the results from interferometric studies and the synthetic spectrum matches the peculiar shape of the spectral lines well. Contexts where this formalism can be applied are outlined.

 As the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) on the Chandra X-ray Observatory completes a quarter century of on orbit operations, it continues to perform well and produce spectacular scientific results. The response of ACIS has evolved over the lifetime of the observatory due to radiation damage, molecular contamination, changing particle environment, and aging of the spacecraft in general. We present highlights from the instrument team's monitoring program and our expectations for the future of ACIS. Performance changes on ACIS continue to be manageable, and do not indicate any limitations on ACIS lifetime. We examine aspects of the design and operation of ACIS that have impacted its long lifetime with lessons learned for future instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 SAXO+ is a planned enhancement of the existing SAXO, the VLT/ SPHERE adaptive optics system, deployed on ESO's Very Large Telescope. This upgrade is designed to significantly enhance the instrument's capacity to detect and analyze young Jupiter-like planets. The pivotal addition in SAXO+ is a second-stage adaptive optics system featuring a dedicated near-infrared pyramid wavefront sensor and a second deformable mirror. This secondary stage is strategically integrated to address any residual wavefront errors persisting after the initial correction performed by the current primary AO loop, SAXO. However, several recent studies clearly showed that in good conditions, even in the current system SAXO, non-common path aberrations (NCPAs) are the limiting factor of the final normalized intensity in focal plane, which is the final metric for ground-based high-contrast instruments. This is likely to be even more so the case with the new AO system, with which the AO residuals will be minimized. Several techniques have already been extensively tested on SPHERE in internal source and/or on-sky and will be presented in this paper. However, the use of a new type of sensor for the second stage, a pyramid wavefront sensor, will likely complicate the correction of these aberrations. Using an end-to-end AO simulation tool, we conducted simulations to gauge the effect of measured SPHERE NCPAs in the coronagraphic image on the second loop system and their correction using focal plane wavefront sensing systems. We finally analyzed how the chosen position of SAXO+ in the beam will impact the evolution of the NCPAs in the new instrument.

 - **Abstract**
 One way to shed some light on the star formation process this process is to analyse the relationship between the spatial distributions of gas and newly formed stars. In order to obtain robust results, it is necessary for this comparison to be made using quantitative and consistent descriptors applied to the same star-forming region. Here, we use fractal analysis to characterise and compare in a self-consistent way the structure of the cloud and the distribution of young stellar objects (YSO) in the Dragonfish star-forming complex. We used different emission maps of the Dragonfish Nebula and photometric information from the AllWISE catalogue to select a total of 1082 YSOs in the region, for some of which we derived physical properties from their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). For both datasets (cloud images and YSOs), the three-dimensional fractal dimension (Df) was calculated using previously developed and calibrated algorithms. The fractal dimension of the Dragonfish Nebula (Df = 2.6-2.7) agrees very well with values previously obtained for the Orion, Ophiuchus, and Perseus clouds. On the other hand, YSOs exhibit on average a significantly smaller value (Df = 1.9-2.0) that indicates a much more clumpy structure than the material from which they formed. This is a clear and direct evidence that the clustering degree of the newly born stars is significantly higher than that of the parent cloud from which they formed, but the physical mechanism behind this behaviour is still not clear. Additionally, younger Class I and Class II sources have smaller values (Df = 1.7 +/- 0.1) than more evolved Transition Disk objects (Df = 2.2 +/- 0.1), evidencing a certain evolutionary effect where an initially clumpy structure tends to gradually disappear over time.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the fluctuations in the vacuum zero point energy associated to quantum fields and their statistical distributions during inflation. It is shown that the perturbations in the vacuum zero point energy have large amplitudes which are highly non-Gaussian. The effects of vacuum zero point fluctuations can be interpreted as the loop corrections in primordial power spectrum and bispectrum. Requiring that the primordial curvature perturbation to remain nearly scale-invariant and Gaussian imposes strong upper bounds on the mass of fundamental fields during inflation. We show that the fundamental fields can not be much heavier than the Hubble scale during inflation, otherwise their vacuum zero point fluctuations induce large non-Gaussianities and scale-dependence in primordial perturbations. Considering the observational upper bound on tensor to scalar ratio, we conclude that all fundamental fields are lighter than $10^{14}$ GeV.

 - **Abstract**
 Photoevaporation driven by hydrogen-ionizing radiation, also known as extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), profoundly shapes the lives of diverse astrophysical objects. Focusing here mainly on the dispersal of protoplanetary disks, we construct an analytical model accounting for the finite timescales of photoheating and photoionization. The model offers improved estimates for the ionization, temperature, and velocity structures versus distance from the central source, for a given EUV emission rate and spectral hardness. Compared to the classical picture of fully-ionized and isothermal winds with temperatures $\approx 10^4{\rm \,K}$ and speeds $\approx 10{\rm \,km\,s^{-1}}$, our model unveils broader hydrodynamical and thermochemical states of photoevaporative winds. In contrast to the classical picture, T~Tauri stars with EUV luminosities around $10^{30}{\rm \,erg\,s^{-1}}$ have non-isothermal ionized winds at lower temperatures than the classical value if the spectrum is soft, with an average deposited energy per photoionization less than about 3.7\,eV. Conversely, if the spectrum is hard, the winds tend to be atomic and isothermal at most radii in the disk. For lower EUV intensities, even with soft spectra, atomic winds can emerge beyond $\sim 10{\, \rm au}$ through advection. We demonstrate that the analytical model's predictions are in general agreement with detailed radiation-hydrodynamics calculations. The model furthermore illustrates how the energy efficiency of photoevaporation varies with the intensity and spectral hardness of the EUV illumination, as well as addressing discrepancies in the literature around the effectiveness of X-ray photoevaporation. These findings highlight the importance of considering the finite timescales of photoheating and photoionization, both in modeling and in interpreting observational data.

 Infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are fruitful objects to study the fragmentation of interstellar filaments and initial conditions and early stages of high-mass ($M>8$ M$_{\odot}$) star formation. We used the Yebes 40 m and IRAM 30 m radio telescopes to carry out the first single-pointing spectral line observations towards the IRDC G1.75-0.08, which is a filamentary Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) cloud. Our aim is to reach an improved understanding of the gas kinematics and dynamical state of the cloud and its two clumps that we call clumps A and B. We also aim to determine the fractional abundances of the molecules detected at 3 mm towards G1.75-0.08. We detected HNCO$(J_{K_a,\,K_c}=4_{0,\,4}-3_{0,\,3})$, HCN$(J=1-0)$, and HCO$^+(J=1-0)$ towards both clumps. The N$_2$H$^+(J=1-0)$ line was detected only in clump B, while N$_2$D$^+(J=1-0)$ was not detected at all. The HCN and HNCO spectra exhibit two velocity components. The abundances of the detected species are comparable to those in other IRDCs. An upper limit to the [N$_2$D$^+$]/[N$_2$H$^+$] deuterium fraction of $<0.05$ derived towards clump B is consistent with values observed in many high-mass clumps. The line mass analysis suggests that the G1.75-0.08 filament is subcritical by a factor of $11\pm6$, and the clumps were found to be gravitationally unbound ($\alpha_{\rm vir} > 2$). Our finding that G1.75-0.08 is strongly subcritical is atypical compared to the general population of Galactic filamentary clouds. The cloud's location in the CMZ might affect the cloud kinematics similar to what has been found for the Brick IRDC, and the cloud's dynamical state might also be the result of the turbulent motions or shear and tidal forces in the CMZ. Because the target clumps are dark at 70 $\mu$m and massive (several $10^3$ M$_{\odot}$), they can be considered candidates for being high-mass starless (but not prestellar) clumps.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarf atmospheres are frequently polluted by material from their own planetary systems. Absorption features from Ca, Mg, Fe and other elements can provide unique insights into the provenance of this exoplanetary material, with their relative abundances being used to infer accretion of material with core- or mantle-like composition. Across the population of white dwarfs, the distribution of compositions reveals the prevalence of geological and collisional processing across exoplanetary systems. By predicting the distribution of compositions in three evolutionary scenarios, this work assesses whether they can explain current observations. We consider evolution in an asteroid belt analog, in which collisions between planetary bodies that formed an iron core lead to core- or mantle-rich fragments. We also consider layer-by-layer accretion of individual bodies, such that the apparent composition of atmospheric pollution changes during the accretion of a single body. Finally, we consider that compositional spread is due to random noise. We find that the distribution of Ca, Fe and Mg in a sample of 202 cool DZs is consistent with the random noise scenario, although 7 individual systems show strong evidence of core-mantle differentiation from additional elements and/or low noise levels. Future surveys which detect multiple elements in each of a few hundred white dwarfs, with well understood biases, have the potential to confidently distinguish between the three models.

 - **Abstract**
 Here we present an analysis of 14 transit light curves of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-54 b. Thirteen of our datasets were obtained with the 6-inch MicroObservatory telescope, Cecilia, and one was measured with the 61-inch Kuiper Telescope. We used the EXOplanet Transit Interpretation Code (EXOTIC) to reduce 49 datasets in order to update the planet's ephemeris to a mid-transit time of 2460216.95257 +/- 0.00022 BJD_TBD and an updated orbital period of 3.79985363 +/- 0.00000037 days. These results improve the mid-transit uncertainty by 70.27% from the most recent ephemeris update. The updated mid-transit time can help to ensure the efficient use of expensive, large ground- and space-based telescope missions in the future. This result demonstrates that amateur astronomers and citizen scientists can provide meaningful, cost-efficient, crowd-sourcing observations using ground-based telescopes to further refine current mid-transit times and orbital periods.

          $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM cosmology: Alleviating major cosmological tensions by predicting standard neutrino properties

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a two-parameter extension of the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model by allowing variations in the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$ and their total mass $\sum m_\nu$. Our motivation is twofold: (i) to examine whether $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM retains its success in fitting the data and addressing major cosmological tensions, without suggesting a need for a deviation from the standard model of particle physics, and (ii) to determine whether the data indicate new physics that could potentially address cosmological tensions, either in the post-recombination universe through the late-time mirror AdS-dS transition, or in the pre-recombination universe through modifications in the standard values of $N_{\rm eff}$ and $\sum m_\nu$, or both. Within the extended $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, referred to as $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM+$N_{\rm eff}$+$\sum m_{\rm \nu}$, we find no significant tension when considering the Planck-alone analysis. We observe that incorporating BAO data limits the further success of the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM extension. However, the weakly model-dependent BAOtr data, along with Planck and Planck+PP\&SH0ES, favor $H_0\sim 73\,{\rm km\, s^{-1}\, Mpc^{-1}}$. In cases where BAOtr dataset is used, the mirror AdS-dS transition is very effective in providing enhanced $H_0$ values, and thus the model requires no significant deviation from the standard value of $N_{\rm eff} = 3.044$. Both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are effectively addressed, with some compromise in the case of the Planck+BAO dataset. Finally, the upper bounds obtained on $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.5$~eV are fully compatible with neutrino oscillation experiments. Our findings provide evidence that late-time physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM, such as $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, without altering the standard pre-recombination universe, can suffice to alleviate the major cosmological tensions.
