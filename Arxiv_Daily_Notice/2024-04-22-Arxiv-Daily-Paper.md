#### Coupled Disk-Star Evolution in Galactic Nuclei and the Lifetimes of QPE  Sources

 - **Abstract**
 A modest fraction of the stars in galactic nuclei fed towards the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) approach on low-eccentricity orbits driven by gravitational-wave radiation (extreme mass ratio inspiral, EMRI). In the likely event that a gaseous accretion disk is created in the nucleus during this slow inspiral (e.g., via an independent tidal-disruption event; TDE), star-disk collisions generate regular short-lived flares consistent with the observed quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) sources. We present a model for the coupled star-disk evolution which self-consistently accounts for mass and thermal energy injected into the disk from stellar collisions and associated mass ablation. For weak collision/ablation heating, the disk is thermally-unstable and undergoes limit-cycle oscillations which modulate its properties and lead to accretion-powered outbursts on timescales of years to decades, with a time-averaged accretion rate $\sim 0.1 \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$. Stronger collision/ablation heating acts to stabilize the disk, enabling roughly steady accretion at the EMRI-stripping rate. In either case, the stellar destruction time through ablation, and hence the maximum QPE lifetime, is $\sim 10^{2}-10^{3}$ yr, far longer than fall-back accretion after a TDE. The quiescent accretion disks in QPE sources may at the present epoch be self-sustaining and fed primarily by EMRI ablation. Indeed, the observed range of secular variability broadly match those predicted for collision-fed disks. Changes in the QPE recurrence pattern following such outbursts, similar to that observed in GSN 069, could arise from temporary misalignment between the EMRI-fed disk and the SMBH equatorial plane as the former regrows its mass after a state transition.

 - **Abstract**
 The growing database of gravitational-wave (GW) detections with the binary black holes (BHs) merging in the distant Universe contains subtle insights into their formation scenarios. One of the puzzling properties of detected GW sources is the possible (anti)correlation between mass ratio q of BH-BH binaries and their effective spin. We use rapid binary evolution models to demonstrate that the isolated binary evolution followed by efficient tidal spin-up of stripped helium core produces a similar pattern in Xeff vs q distributions of BH-BH mergers. In our models, the progenitors of unequal BH-BH systems in the stable mass transfer formation scenario are more likely to efficiently shrink their orbits during the second Roche-lobe overflow than the binaries that evolve into nearly equal-mass component systems. This makes it easier for unequal-mass progenitors to enter the tidal spin-up regime and later merge due to GW emission. Our results are, however, sensitive to some input assumptions, especially, the stability of mass transfer and the angular momentum loss during non-conservative mass transfer. We note that mass transfer prescriptions widely adopted in rapid codes favor the formation of BH-BH merger progenitors with unequal masses and moderate separations. We compare our results with detailed stellar model grids and find reasonable agreement after appropriate calibration of the physics models. We anticipate that future detections of unequal-mass BH-BH mergers could provide valuable constraints on the role of the stable mass transfer formation channel. A significant fraction of BH-BH detections with mass ratio q in range (0.4 - 0.7) would be consistent with the mass ratio reversal scenario during the first, relatively conservative mass transfer, and a non-enhanced angular momentum loss during the second, highly non-conservative mass transfer phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We present detailed radio observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-19bt/AT2019ahk, obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and the MeerKAT radio telescopes, spanning 40 to 1464 days after the onset of the optical flare. We find that ASASSN-19bt displays unusual radio evolution compared to other TDEs, as the peak brightness of its radio emission increases rapidly until 457 days post-optical discovery and then plateaus. Using a generalized approach to standard equipartition techniques, we estimate the energy and corresponding physical parameters for two possible emission geometries: a non-relativistic spherical outflow and a relativistic outflow observed from an arbitrary viewing angle. We find that the non-relativistic solution implies a continuous energy rise in the outflow from $E\sim10^{46}$ erg to $E\sim10^{49}$ erg with $\beta \approx 0.05$, while the off-axis relativistic jet solution instead suggests $E\approx10^{52}$ erg with $\Gamma\sim10$ erg at late times in the maximally off-axis case. We find that neither model provides a holistic explanation for the origin and evolution of the radio emission, emphasizing the need for more complex models. ASASSN-19bt joins the population of TDEs that display unusual radio emission at late times. Conducting long-term radio observations of these TDEs, especially during the later phases, will be crucial for understanding how these types of radio emission in TDEs are produced.
#### Three-dimensional Interaction between a Planet and an Isothermal Gaseous  Disk. III. Locally Isothermal Cases

 - **Abstract**
 We performed linear calculations to determine the Type I planetary migration rate for three-dimensional locally isothermal disks with radial temperature gradients. For 3D disks with radial temperature gradients, the linear wave equation has a divergent term of the third pole, which makes corotation a non-removal singularity. We suppressed the divergence with the Landau prescription to obtain the wave solutions. Despite the singularity at corotation, we derived a definite torque on the planet because the divergent term amplifies the waves only in the neighborhood of corotation and has little effect on the planetary torque. Consequently, we derived the formulas for the total, Lindblad, and corotation torques for locally isothermal disks. The resulting torque term due to the disk temperature gradient agrees well with the results of previous 3D hydrodynamical simulations for locally isothermal disks. Our linear calculation also provides the 3D horseshoe torque, which is close to the results of previous 3D hydrodynamical simulations.
#### The longevity of the oldest open clusters: Structural parameters of NGC  188, NGC 2420, NGC 2425, NGC 2682, NGC 6791, NGC 6819

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Open clusters' dynamical evolution is driven by stellar evolution, internal dynamics and external forces, which according to dynamical simulations, will evaporate them in a timescale of about 1 Ga. However, about 10\% of the known open clusters are older. They are special systems whose detailed properties are related to their dynamical evolution and the balance between mechanisms of cluster formation and dissolution. Aims:We investigate the spatial distribution and structural parameters of six open clusters older than 1 Ga in order to constrain their dynamical evolution, and longevity.} Methods: We identify members using Gaia EDR3 data up to a distance of 150 pc from each cluster's centre. We investigate the spatial distribution of stars inside each cluster to understand their degree of mass segregation. Finally, in order to interpret the obtained radial density profiles we reproduced them using the lowered isothermal model explorer with PYTHON Limepy and spherical potential escapers stitched SPES. Results: All the studied clusters seem more extended than previously reported in the literature. The spatial distributions of three of them show some structures aligned with their orbits. They may be related to the existence of extra tidal stars. In fact, we find that about 20 % of their members have enough energy to leave the systems or are already unbound. Together with their initial masses, their distances to the Galactic plane may play significant roles in their survival. We found clear evidences that the most dynamically evolved clusters do not fill their Roche volumes, appearing more concentrated than the others. Finally, we find a cusp-core dichotomy in the central regions of the studied clusters, which shows some similarities to the one observed among globular clusters.
#### Pulsar glitch activities: the spin parameters approach

 - **Abstract**
 Glitch activity refers to the mean increase in pulsar spin frequency per year due to rotational glitches. It is an important tool for studying super-nuclear matter using neutron star interiors as templates. Glitch events are typically observed in the spin frequency ($\nu$) and frequency derivative ($\dot{\nu}$) of pulsars. The rate of glitch recurrence decreases as the pulsar ages, and the activity parameter is usually measured by linear regression of cumulative glitches over a given period. This method is effective for pulsars with multiple regular glitch events. However, due to the scarcity of glitch events and the difficulty of monitoring all known pulsars, only a few have multiple records of glitch events. This limits the use of the activity parameter in studying neutron star interiors with multiple pulsars. In this study, we examined the relationship between the activity parameters and pulsar spin parameters (spin frequency, frequency derivative, and pulsar characteristic age). We found that a quadratic function provides a better fit for the relationship between activity parameters and spin parameters than the commonly used linear functions. Using this information, we were able to estimate the activity parameters of other pulsars that do not have records of glitches. Our analysis shows that the relationship between the estimated activity parameters and pulsar spin parameters is consistent with that of the observed activity parameters in the ensemble of pulsars.
#### Pinwheel Outflow induced by Stellar Mass Loss in a Coplanar Triple  System

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a physical framework for interpreting complex circumstellar patterns whorled around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars by investigating stable, coplanar triple systems using hydrodynamic and particle simulations. The introduction of a close tertiary body causes an additional periodic variation in the orbital velocity and trajectory of the AGB star. As a result, the circumstellar outflow builds a fine non-Archimedean spiral pattern superimposed upon the Archimedean spiral produced by the outer binary alone. This fine spiral can be approximated by off-centered circular rings that become tangent to each other at the location of the Archimedean spiral. The superimposed fine pattern fades out relatively quickly as a function of distance from the center of the system, in contrast to the dominant Archimedean spiral pattern, which presents a much slower fractional density decrease with radius. The different rates of radial decrease of the density contrast in the two superimposed patterns, coupled with their different time and spatial scales, lead to an apparent, but illusory radial change in the observed pattern interval, as has been reported, for example, in CW Leo. The function describing the detailed radial dependence of the expansion velocity is different in the two patterns, which may be used to distinguish them. The shape of the circumstellar whorled pattern is further explored as a function of the orbital eccentricity and the inner companion's mass. Although this study is confined to stable, coplanar triple systems, the results are likely applicable to moderately noncoplanar systems and open interesting avenues for studying noncoplanar systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-mass black hole binaries (BHBs) in galactic nuclei are gravitationally perturbed by the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) of the host galaxy, potentially inducing strong eccentricity oscillations through the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. These highly eccentric binaries emit a train of gravitational-wave (GW) bursts detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) -- a planned space-based GW detector -- with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) up to ${\sim}100$ per burst. In this work, we study the GW signature of BHBs orbiting our galaxy's SMBH, Sgr A$^*$, which are consequently driven to very high eccentricities. We demonstrate that an unmodeled approach using a wavelet decomposition of the data effectively yields the time-frequency properties of each burst, provided that the GW frequency peaks between $10^{-3}\,\,\mathrm{Hz}$--$10^{-1}\,\,\mathrm{Hz}$. The wavelet parameters may be used to infer the eccentricity of the binary, measuring $\log_{10}(1-e)$ within an error of $20\%$. Our proposed search method can thus constrain the parameter space to be sampled by complementary Bayesian inference methods, which use waveform templates or orthogonal wavelets to reconstruct and subtract the signal from LISA data.

 - **Abstract**
 The attenuation of Ly$\alpha$ photons by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) at $z\gtrsim5$ continues to be a powerful probe for studying the epoch of reionisation. Given a framework to estimate the intrinsic (true) Ly$\alpha$ emission of high-$z$ sources, one can infer the ionisation state of the IGM during reionisation. In this work, we use the enlarged XQR-30 sample of 42 high-resolution and high-SNR QSO spectra between $5.8\lesssim\,z\lesssim\,6.6$ obtained with VLT/X-Shooter to place constraints on the IGM neutral fraction. This is achieved using our existing Bayesian QSO reconstruction framework which accounts for uncertainties such as the: (i) posterior distribution of predicted intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ emission profiles (obtained via covariance matrix reconstruction of the Ly$\alpha$ and N V emission lines from unattenuated high-ionisation emission line profiles; C IV, Si IV + O IV] and C III]) and (ii) distribution of ionised regions within the IGM using synthetic damping wing profiles drawn from a $1.6^3$ Gpc$^3$ reionisation simulation. Following careful quality control, we used 23 of the 42 available QSOs to obtain constraints/limits on the IGM neutral fraction during the tail-end of reionisation. Our median and 68th percentile constraints on the IGM neutral fraction are: $0.20\substack{+0.14\\-0.12}$ and $0.29\substack{+0.14\\-0.13}$ at $z = 6.15$~and 6.35. Further, we also report 68th percentile upper-limits of $\bar{x}_{\mathrm{H\,{\scriptscriptstyle I}}} < 0.21$, 0.20, 0.21 and 0.18 at $z = 5.8, 5.95, 6.05$~and 6.55. These results imply reionisation is still ongoing at $5.8\lesssim\,z\lesssim\,6.55$, consistent with previous results from XQR-30 (dark fraction and Ly$\alpha$ forest) along with other observational probes considered in the literature.
#### The LISA forecast on a smooth crossover beyond the Standard Model  through the scalar-induced gravitational waves

 - **Abstract**
 Supposing the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) gravitational wave (GW) detector, we exhibit the detectability of a hypothetical smooth crossover in the early universe beyond the Standard Model of particle physics through the scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) in terms of the Fisher forecast. A crossover at $\sim100\,\mathrm{TeV}$ can leave a signal on the GW spectrum in the $\sim\mathrm{mHz}$ frequency range, the sweet spot of the LISA sensitivity. These possibilities are also interesting in the primordial black hole (PBH) context as the associated PBH mass $\sim10^{22}\,\mathrm{g}$ lies at the window to explain the whole dark matter. We found that the properties of the crossover can be well determined if the power spectrum of primordial scalar perturbations are as large as $\sim5\times10^{-4}$ on the corresponding scale $\sim10^{12}\,\mathrm{Mpc^{-1}}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We report an analysis of a sample of 186 spectroscopically confirmed Type II supernova (SN) light curves (LCs) obtained from a combination of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) observations. We implement a method to infer physical parameters from these LCs using hydrodynamic models that take into account the progenitor mass, the explosion energy, and the presence of circumstellar matter (CSM). The CSM is modelled via the mass loss rate, wind acceleration at the surface of the progenitor star with a $\beta$ velocity law, and the CSM radius. We also infer the time of explosion, attenuation (A$_V$), and the redshift for each SN. Our results favor low-mass progenitor stars (M$_{ZAMS}$\,$<$14\,$M_\odot$) with a dense CSM ($\dot{M}$ $>$ 10$^{-3}$ [M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$], a CSM radius of $\sim$ 10$^{15}$ cm, and $\beta$ $>$ 2). Additionally, we find that the redshift inferred from the supernova LCs is significantly more accurate than that inferred using the host galaxy photometric redshift, suggesting that this method could be used to infer more accurate host galaxy redshifts from large samples of SNe II in the LSST era. Lastly, we compare our results with similar works from the literature.
#### Maser Activity of Organic Molecules toward Sgr B2(N)

 - **Abstract**
 At centimeter wavelengths, single-dish observations have suggested that the Sagittarius (Sgr) B2 molecular cloud at the Galactic Center hosts weak maser emission from several organic molecules, including CH$_2$NH, HNCNH, and HCOOCH$_3$. However, the lack of spatial distribution information of these new maser species has prevented us from assessing the excitation conditions of the maser emission as well as their pumping mechanisms. Here, we present a mapping study toward Sgr B2 North (N) to locate the region where the complex maser emission originates. We report the first detection of the Class I methanol (CH$_3$OH) maser at 84 GHz and the first interferometric map of the methanimine (CH$_2$NH) maser at 5.29 GHz toward this region. In addition, we present a tool for modeling and fitting the unsaturated molecular maser signals with non-LTE radiative transfer models and Bayesian analysis using the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo approach. These enable us to quantitatively assess the observed spectral profiles. The results suggest a two-chain-clump model for explaining the intense CH$_3$OH Class I maser emission toward a region with low continuum background radiation. By comparing the spatial origin and extent of maser emission from several molecular species, we find that the 5.29 GHz CH$_2$NH maser has a close spatial relationship with the 84 GHz CH$_3$OH Class I masers. This relationship serves as observational evidence to suggest a similar collisional pumping mechanism for these maser transitions.
#### Climbing over the potential barrier during inflation via null energy  condition violation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12655
 - **Abstract**
 The violation of the null energy condition (NEC) may play a crucial role in enabling a scalar field to climb over high potential barriers, potentially significant in the very early universe. We propose a single-field model where the universe sequentially undergoes a first stage of slow-roll inflation, NEC violation, and a second stage of slow-roll inflation. Through the NEC violation, the scalar field climbs over high potential barriers, leaving unique characteristics on the primordial gravitational wave power spectrum, including a blue-tilted nature in the middle-frequency range and diminishing oscillation amplitudes at higher frequencies. Additionally, the power spectrum exhibits nearly scale-invariant behavior on both large and small scales.
#### TOI-4336 A b: A temperate sub-Neptune ripe for atmospheric  characterization in a nearby triple M-dwarf system

 Small planets transiting bright nearby stars are essential to our understanding of the formation and evolution of exoplanetary systems. However, few constitute prime targets for atmospheric characterization, and even fewer are part of multiple star systems. This work aims to validate TOI-4336 A b, a sub-Neptune-sized exoplanet candidate identified by the TESS space-based transit survey around a nearby M-dwarf. We validate the planetary nature of TOI-4336 A b through the global analysis of TESS and follow-up multi-band high-precision photometric data from ground-based telescopes, medium- and high-resolution spectroscopy of the host star, high-resolution speckle imaging, and archival images. The newly discovered exoplanet TOI-4336 A b has a radius of 2.1$\pm$0.1R$_{\oplus}$. Its host star is an M3.5-dwarf star of mass 0.33$\pm$0.01M$_{\odot}$ and radius 0.33$\pm$0.02R$_{\odot}$ member of a hierarchical triple M-dwarf system 22 pc away from the Sun. The planet's orbital period of 16.3 days places it at the inner edge of the Habitable Zone of its host star, the brightest of the inner binary pair. The parameters of the system make TOI-4336 A b an extremely promising target for the detailed atmospheric characterization of a temperate sub-Neptune by transit transmission spectroscopy with JWST.
#### Inflation, the Hubble Tension and Early Dark Energy: an alternative  overview

 - **Abstract**
 I review and discuss the possible implications for inflation resulting from considering new physics in light of the Hubble tension. My study is motivated by a simple argument that the constraints on inflationary parameters, most typically the spectral index $n_s$, depend to some extent on the cosmological framework. To avoid broadening the uncertainties resulting from marginalizing over additional parameters (typical in many alternative models), I first adopt the same alternative viewpoint of previous studies and analyze what happens if a physical theory can fix extra parameters to non-standard values. Focusing on the dark energy equation of state $w$ and the effective number of relativistic species $N_{\rm{eff}}$, I confirm that physical theories able to fix $w \approx -1.2$ or $N_{\rm{eff}} \approx 3.9$ produce values of $H_0$ from CMB and BAO in line with the local distance ladder estimate. While in the former case I do not find any relevant implications for inflation, in the latter scenarios, I observe a shift towards $n_s \approx 1$. From a model-selection perspective, both cases are strongly disfavored compared to $\Lambda$CDM. However, models with $N_{\rm{eff}} \approx 3.3 - 3.4$ could bring the $H_0$ tension down to $\sim 3\sigma$ while being moderately disfavored. Yet, this is enough to change the constraints on inflation so that the most accredited models (e.g., Starobinsky inflation) would no longer be favored by data. I then focus on Early Dark Energy (EDE), arguing that an EDE fraction $f_{\rm{EDE}}\sim 0.04 - 0.06$ (only able to mildly reduce the $H_0$-tension down to $\sim 3\sigma$) could already require a similar change in perspective on inflation. In fact, performing a full joint analysis of EDE and Starobinsky inflation, I find that the two models can hardly coexist for $f_{\rm{EDE}}\gtrsim 0.06$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of seven years of multicolour photometric monitoring of a sample of 31 $\gamma$-ray bright blazars using the RINGO3 polarimeter on the Liverpool Telescope from 2013--2020. We explore the relationships between simultaneous observations of flux in three optical wavebands along with Fermi $\gamma$-ray data in order to explore the radiation mechanisms and particle populations in blazar jets. We find significant correlations between optical and $\gamma$-ray flux with no detectable time lag, suggesting leptonic emission processes in the jets of these sources. Furthermore, we find the spectral behaviour against optical and $\gamma$-ray flux for many sources is best fit logarithmically. This is suggestive of a transition between bluer-/redder-when-brighter into stable-when-brighter behaviour during high activity states; a behaviour that might be missed in poorly sampled data, resulting in apparent linear relationships.

 We present a comprehensive study of compact stars admixed with non-self annihilating self-interacting fermionic dark matter, delineating the dependence on the nuclear equation of state by considering the two limiting parametrized equations of state for neutron star matter obtained by smoothly matching the low-density chiral effective theory and the high-density perturbative QCD. These two parametrizations are the limiting cases of a wide variety of smooth equations of state, i.e. the softest and stiffest possible one without a phase transition, that generate masses and radii compatible with 2M$_\odot$ observations and the tidal constraint from GW170817. With an exhaustive analysis of the possible stable mass-radius configurations, we determine the quantity of dark matter contained in stars with masses and radii compatible with the aforementioned astrophysical constraints. We find that for dark particle masses of a few tenths of GeV, the dark core collapses and no stable solutions are found irrespective on the chosen nuclear equation of state. For lower masses, the dark matter fraction is limited to 10%, being at most 1% for masses ranging from 0.1 to 10 GeV for the limiting soft nuclear equation of state. For the limiting stiff nuclear equation of state, the dark matter fraction can reach values of more than 10%, but the dark particle mass is being constrained to 0.3 GeV and 10 GeV for the weak self-interacting case and has to be at least 5 GeV for the strong self-interacting one. For dark particle masses of less than 0.1 GeV, stable neutron star configurations should have less than 1% of self-interacting dark matter to be compatible with the constraint of the tidal deformability from GW170817 irrespective on the chosen nuclear equation of state.

 - **Abstract**
 Gaussian processes method is employed to analyze the light curves of bursts detected by Insight-HXMT, NICER, and GECAM from SGR 1935+2154 between 2020 to 2022. It is found that a stochastically driven damped simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) is necessary to capture the characteristics of the X-ray bursts. Variability timescale of the X-ray bursts, corresponding to the broken frequencies in the SHO power spectral densities (PSDs), are extracted. In particular, a high broken frequency of 35 Hz where the index of the SHO PSD changes from -4 to -2 is constrained by the HXMT-HE burst associated with FRB 200428. It is suggested that the corresponding timescale of 0.03 s could be the retarding timescale of the system driven by some kind of energy release, and the production of the HE photon should be quasi-simultaneous with the response. The other special event is a NICER burst with a retarding timescale of 1/39 Hz (0.02 s). In the normal X-ray bursts, no retarding timescale is constrained; a long relax/equilibrium timescale (corresponding to a broken frequency of 1-10 Hz where the index of the SHO PSD changing from -4/-2 to 0 in the SHO PSD) is obtained. The results indicate that the FRB-associated HXMT-HE X-ray burst could be produced immediately when the system is responding to the energy disturbance, far before the equilibrium state.

 - **Abstract**
 Sharp structural variations induce specific signatures on stellar pulsations that can be studied to infer localised information on the stratification of the star. This information is key to improve our understanding of the physical processes that lead to the structural variations and how to model them. Here we revisit and extend the analysis of the signature of different types of buoyancy glitches in gravity-mode and mixed-mode pulsators presented in earlier works, including glitches with step-like, Gaussian-like, and Dirac-$\delta$-like shapes. In particular, we provide analytical expressions for the perturbations to the periods and show that these can be reliably used in place of the expressions provided for the period spacings, with the advantage that the use of the new expressions does not require modes with consecutive radial orders to be observed. Based on a comparison with two limit cases and on simulated data, we further tested the accuracy of the expression for the Gaussian-like glitch signature whose derivation in an earlier work involved a significant approximation. We find that the least reliable glitch parameter inferred from fitting that expression is the amplitude, which can be up to a factor of two larger than the true amplitude, reaching this limit when the glitch is small. We further discuss the impact on the glitch signature of considering a glitch in the inner and outer half of the g-mode cavity, emphasising the break of symmetry that takes place in the case of mixed-mode pulsators.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Interstellar surface chemistry is a complex process that occurs in icy layers accumulated onto grains of different sizes. Efficiency of surface processes often depends on the immediate environment of adsorbed molecules. Aims. We investigate how gas-grain chemistry changes when surface molecule desorption is made explicitly dependent to the molecular binding energy, which is modified, depending on the properties of the surface. Methods. Molecular binding energy changes gradually for three different environments - bare grain, where polar, water-dominated ices and non-polar, carbon monoxide-dominated ices. In addition to diffusion, evaporation and chemical desorption, photodesorption was also made binding energy-dependent, in line with experimental results. These phenomena occur in a collapsing prestellar core model that considers five grain sizes with ices arranged into four layers. Results. Efficient chemical desorption from bare grains significantly delays ice accumulation. Easier surface diffusion of molecules on non-polar ices promotes the production of carbon dioxide and other species. Conclusions. The composition of interstellar ices is regulated by several binding-energy dependent desorption mechanisms. Their actions overlap in time and space, which explains the ubiquitous proportions of major ice components (water and carbon oxides), observed to be similar in all directions.

 - **Abstract**
 Cliff collapses on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko expose relatively pristine nucleus matter and offer rare opportunities to characterise ice-rich comet material. Here, Microwave Instrument for \emph{Rosetta} Orbiter (MIRO) observations of two collapsed or crumbling cliffs in the Imhotep and Hathor regions have been assembled. The empirical diurnal antenna temperature curves are analysed with thermophysical and radiative transfer models in order to place constraints on the physical properties and degrees of stratification in the near-surface material. The Imhotep site consists of an exposed dust/water-ice mixture with thermal inertia 100-$160\,\mathrm{J\,m^{-2}\,K^{-1}\,s^{-1/2}}$, having sublimating $\mathrm{CO_2}$ ice located $11\pm 4\,\mathrm{cm}$ below the surface. Its estimated age is consistent with an outburst observed on 2014 April 27-30. The Hathor site has a $0.8\pm 0.2\,\mathrm{cm}$ dust mantle, a thermal inertia of $40\pm 20\,\mathrm{J\,m^{-2}\,K^{-1}\,s^{-1/2}}$, no $\mathrm{CO_2}$ ice to within $1.0\,\mathrm{m}$ depth, and a mantle bulk density of $340\pm 80\,\mathrm{kg\,m^{-3}}$ that is higher than the theoretically expected $180\pm 10\,\mathrm{kg\,m^{-3}}$, suggesting that compression has taken place.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of the microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-0845, which was affected by both the microlensing parallax and xallarap effects. The former was detected via the simultaneous observations from the ground and Spitzer, and the latter was caused by the orbital motion of the source star in a relatively close binary. The combination of these two effects led to a direct mass measurement of the lens object, revealing a low-mass ($0.14 \pm 0.05 M_{\odot}$) M-dwarf at the bulge distance ($7.6 \pm 1.0$ kpc). The source binary consists of a late F-type subgiant and a K-type dwarf of $\sim1.2 M_{\odot}$ and $\sim 0.9 M_{\odot}$, respectively, and the orbital period is $70 \pm 10$ days. OGLE-2015-BLG-0845 is the first single-lens event in which the lens mass is measured via the binarity of the source. Given the abundance of binary systems as potential microlensing sources, the xallarap effect may not be a rare phenomenon. Our work thus highlights the application of the xallarap effect in the mass determination of microlenses, and the same method can be used to identify isolated dark lenses.

 - **Abstract**
 We observed the planet-hosting system PDS 70 with the James Webb Interferometer, JWST's Aperture Masking Interferometric (AMI) mode within NIRISS. Observing with the F480M filter centered at 4.8 $\mu$m, we simultaneously fit a geometric model to the outer disk and the two known planetary companions. We re-detect the protoplanets PDS 70 b and c at an SNR of 21 and 11, respectively. Our photometry of both PDS 70 b and c provide evidence for circumplanetary disk emission through fitting SED models to these new measurements and those found in the literature. We also newly detect emission within the disk gap at an SNR of $\sim$4, at a position angle of $207^{+11}_{-10}$ degrees, and an unconstrained separation within $\sim$200 mas. Follow-up observations will be needed to determine the nature of this emission. We place a 5$\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta$mag = 7.56 on the contrast of the candidate PDS 70 d at 4.8 $\mu$m, which indicates that if the previously observed emission at shorter wavelengths is due to a planet, this putative planet has a different atmospheric composition than PDS 70 b or c. Finally, we place upper limits on emission from any additional planets in the disk gap. We find an azimuthally averaged 5$\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta$mag $\approx$ 7.5 at separations greater than 125 mas. These are the deepest limits to date within $\sim$250 mas at 4.8 $\mu$m and the first space-based interferometric observations of this system.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The star-black hole (S-BH) binary discovered by the Gaia Collaboration - Gaia BH3 - is chemically and kinematically associated with the metal-poor ED-2 stream in the Milky Way halo. Aims. We explore the possibility that Gaia BH3 was assembled dynamically in the progenitor globular cluster (GC) of the ED-2 stream. Methods. We use a public suite of star-by-star dynamical Monte Carlo models by Kremer et al. (2020) to identify S-BH binaries in GCs with different initial masses and (half-mass) radii. Results. We show that a likely progenitor of the ED-2 stream was a relatively low-mass ($\lesssim10^5M_\odot$) GC with an initial half-mass radius of 2 - 4 pc. Such a GC can dynamically retain a large fraction of its BH population and dissolve on the orbit of ED-2. From the suite of models we find that GCs produce ~ 3 - 30 S-BH binaries, approximately independent of initial GC mass and inversely correlated with initial cluster radius. Scaling the results to the Milky Way GC population, we find that ~$75\%$ of the S-BH binaries formed in GCs are ejected from their host GC in the early phases of evolution ($\lesssim1$ Gyr); these are expected to no longer be close to the stream. The ~25\% of S-BH binaries retained until dissolution are expected to form part of streams, such that for an initial mass of the progenitor of ED-2 of a few $10^4M_\odot$, we expect ~2-3 S-BH to end up in the stream. GC models with metallicities similar to Gaia BH3 ($\lesssim1\%$ solar) include S-BH binaries with similar BH masses ($\gtrsim30M_\odot$), orbital periods, and eccentricities. Conclusions. We predict the Galactic halo contains of order $10^5$ S-BH binaries that formed dynamically in GCs, a fraction of which may readily be detected in Gaia DR4. The detection of these sources provides valuable tests of BH dynamics in clusters and the possible role in formation of gravitational wave sources.
#### Formation of a $33\,M_{\odot}$ black hole in a low-metallicity binary

 - **Abstract**
 A $33\,M_\odot$ black hole (BH) was recently discovered in an 11.6-year binary only 590 pc from the Sun. The system, Gaia BH3, contains a $0.8\,M_\odot$ low-metallicity giant ($\rm [M/H]=-2.2$) and is kinematically part of the Galactic halo, suggesting that the BH formed from a low-metallicity massive star. I show that orbits similar to that of Gaia BH3 are naturally produced through isolated binary evolution. The system's period and eccentricity can result from a broad range of initial orbits with a modest natal kick ($v_{\rm kick}\lesssim 75\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$) to the BH. I construct MESA models for metal-poor massive stars with initial masses ranging from $35-55\,M_{\odot}$, which reach maximum radii of $1150-1800\,R_{\odot}$ as red supergiants. Stars of this size would fit inside most plausible pre-supernova orbits for the system without overflowing their Roche lobes. In addition, models with moderately rapid initial rotation ($\Omega/\Omega_{\rm crit} \gtrsim 0.45$) undergo chemically homogeneous evolution and never expand to radii larger than $10\,R_{\odot}$. There are thus multiple channels through which a low-metallicity, extreme-mass ratio binary could produce a system like Gaia BH3. Dynamical formation scenarios are also viable, and there is little doubt that both isolated and dynamically-formed BH binaries with orbits similar to Gaia BH3 will be discovered in Gaia DR4. Only about 1 in 10,000 stars in the solar neighborhood have metallicities as low as Gaia BH3. This suggests that BH companions are dramatically over-represented at low-metallicity, though caveats related to small number statistics apply. The fact that the luminous star in Gaia BH3 has been a giant - greatly boosting its detectability - only for $\sim$1% of the time since the system's formation implies that additional massive BHs remain to be discovered with only moderately fainter companions.
