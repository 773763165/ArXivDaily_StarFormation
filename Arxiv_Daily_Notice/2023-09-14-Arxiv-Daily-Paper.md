#### Planetesimals at DZ stars I: chondritic compositions and a massive  accretion event

 - **Abstract**
 There is a wealth of evidence to suggest that planetary systems can survive beyond the main sequence. Most commonly, white dwarfs are found to be accreting material from tidally disrupted asteroids, whose bulk compositions are reflected by the metals polluting the stellar photospheres. While many examples are known, most lack the deep, high-resolution data required to detect multiple elements, and thus characterise the planetesimals that orbit them. Here, spectra of seven DZ white dwarfs observed with Keck HIRES are analysed, where up to nine metals are measured per star. Their compositions are compared against those of solar system objects, working in a Bayesian framework to infer or marginalise over the accretion history. All of the stars have been accreting primitive material, similar to chondrites, with hints of a Mercury-like composition at one star. The most polluted star is observed several Myr after its last major accretion episode, in which a Moon-sized object met its demise.

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming large-scale spectroscopic surveys with e.g. WEAVE and 4MOST will provide thousands of spectra of massive stars, which need to be analysed in an efficient and homogeneous way. Usually, studies of massive stars are limited to samples of a few hundred objects which pushes current spectroscopic analysis tools to their limits because visual inspection is necessary to verify the spectroscopic fit. Often uncertainties are only estimated rather than derived and prior information cannot be incorporated without a Bayesian approach. In addition, uncertainties of stellar atmospheres and radiative transfer codes are not considered as a result of simplified, inaccurate or incomplete/missing physics or, in short, idealised physical models. Here, we address the question of "How to compare an idealised model of complex objects to real data?" with an empirical Bayesian approach and maximum a {\it posterior} approximations. We focus on application to large scale optical spectroscopic studies of complex astrophysical objects like stars. More specifically, we test and verify our methodology on samples of OB stars in 30 Doradus region of the Large Magellanic Clouds using a grid of FASTWIND model atmospheres. Our spectroscopic model de-idealisation analysis pipeline takes advantage of the statistics that large samples provide by determining the model error to account for the idealised stellar atmosphere models, which are included into the error budget. The pipeline performs well over a wide parameter space and derives robust stellar parameters with representative uncertainties.
#### The thesan project: public data release of radiation-hydrodynamic  simulations matching reionization-era JWST observations

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological simulations serve as invaluable tools for understanding the Universe. However, the technical complexity and substantial computational resources required to generate such simulations often limit their accessibility within the broader research community. Notable exceptions exist, but most are not suited for simultaneously studying the physics of galaxy formation and cosmic reionization during the first billion years of cosmic history. This is especially relevant now that a fleet of advanced observatories (e.g. James Webb Space Telescope, Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, SPHEREx, ELT, SKA) will soon provide an holistic picture of this defining epoch. To bridge this gap, we publicly release all simulation outputs and post-processing products generated within the THESAN simulation project at https://thesan-project.com. This project focuses on the $z \geq 5.5$ Universe, combining a radiation-hydrodynamics solver (AREPO-RT), a well-tested galaxy formation model (IllustrisTNG) and cosmic dust physics to provide a comprehensive view of the Epoch of Reionization. The THESAN suite includes 16 distinct simulations, each varying in volume, resolution, and underlying physical models. This paper outlines the unique features of these new simulations, the production and detailed format of the wide range of derived data products, and the process for data retrieval. Finally, as a case study, we compare our simulation data with a number of recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope, affirming the accuracy and applicability of THESAN. The examples also serve as prototypes for how to utilise the released dataset to perform comparisons between predictions and observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Lensing reconstruction maps from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide direct observations of the matter distribution of the universe without the use of a biased tracer. Such maps, however, constitute projected observables along the line of sight that are dominated by their low-redshift contributions. To cleanly access high-redshift information, Maniyar et al. showed that a linear combination of lensing maps from both CMB and line intensity mapping (LIM) observations can exactly null the low-redshift contribution to CMB lensing convergence. In this paper we explore the scientific returns of this nulling technique. We show that LIM-nulling estimators can place constraints on standard $\Lambda$CDM plus neutrino mass parameters that are competitive with traditional CMB lensing. Additionally, we demonstrate that as a clean probe of the high-redshift universe, LIM-nulling can be used for model-independent tests of cosmology beyond $\Lambda$CDM and as a probe of the high-redshift matter power spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 The number of available constraints on the Universe during and before cosmic reionization is rapidly growing. These are often scattered across inhomogeneous formats, unit systems and sampling strategies. In this paper, I introduce CoReCon, a Python package designed to provide a growing set of constraints on key physical quantities related to the Epoch of Reionization and a platform for the high-redshift research community to collect and store, in an open way, current and forthcoming observational constraints.
#### Towards Accurate Modeling of Line-Intensity Mapping One-Point  Statistics: Including Extended Profiles

 - **Abstract**
 Line-intensity mapping (LIM) is quickly attracting attention as an alternative technique to probe large-scale structure and galaxy formation and evolution at high redshift. LIM one-point statistics are motivated because they provide access to the highly non-Gaussian information present in line-intensity maps and contribute to break degeneracies between cosmology and astrophysics. Now that promising surveys are underway, an accurate model for the LIM probability distribution function (PDF) is necessary to employ one-point statistics. We consider the impact of extended emission and limited experimental resolution in the LIM PDF for the first time. We find that these effects result in a lower and broader peak at low intensities and a lower tail towards high intensities. Focusing on the distribution of intensities in the observed map, we perform the first model validation of LIM one-point statistics with simulations and find good qualitative agreement. We also discuss the impact on the covariance, and demonstrate that if not accounted for, large biases in the astrophysical parameters can be expected in parameter inference. These effects are also relevant for any summary statistic estimated from the LIM PDF, and must be implemented to avoid biased results. The comparison with simulations shows, however, that there are still deviations, mostly related with the modeling of the clustering of emitters, which encourage further development of the modeling of LIM one-point statistics.
#### Asymmetric Capture into Neptunian 1:2 Resonance

 - **Abstract**
 The asymmetric resonance configuration characterized by the critical angle librating around centres other than 0 or 180 degree, is found in the 1:N mean motion resonance. The asymmetric 1:2 resonance with Neptune is of particular interest because the two asymmetric islands seem to host different populations, and this might be a direct clue to understanding the early evolution of the Solar system. The asymmetry has been investigated from both observational and theoretical perspectives, but conclusions among studies vary widely. In this paper using toy models, we carefully designed a series of tests to systematically study the capture of planetesimals into the leading and trailing resonance islands. Although these tests may not reproduce exactly the real processes the Solar system experienced, they reveal some typical dynamics in the resonance capture. Since the real Twotinos have small to moderate inclinations, as the first attempt, we adopted in this paper planar models to investigate the mechanisms that may lead to asymmetric capture by the leading and trailing islands, including their size variation during the outward migration of Neptune, the stickiness of the leading island, and the migration slowdown effect. Particularly, we find that the ratio between the populations of the leading and trailing islands can be easily tuned by introducing the slowdown effect in the migration model, thus may be not a good tracer of the migration history. However, the eccentricity of objects trapped in two asymmetric islands may conserve some valuable information of the early evolution of the Solar system.
#### Jupiter's Metastable Companions

 - **Abstract**
 Jovian co-orbitals share Jupiter's orbit in 1:1 mean motion resonance. This includes $>$10,000 so-called Trojan asteroids surrounding the leading (L4) and trailing (L5) Lagrange points, viewed as stable groups dating back to planet formation. Via a massive numerical study we identify for the first time some Trojans which are certainly only `metastable'; instead of being primordial, they are recent captures from heliocentric orbits into moderately long-lived (10 kyr - 100 Myr) metastable states that will escape back to the scattering regime. We have also identified (1) the first two jovian horseshoe co-orbitals that exist for many resonant libration periods, and (2) eight jovian quasi-satellites with metastable lifetimes of 4-130 kyr. Our perspective on the Trojan population is thus now more complex as Jupiter joins the other giant planets in having known metastable co-orbitals which are in steady-state equilibrium with the planet-crossing Centaur and asteroid populations, in agreement with theoretical estimates.
#### Dark age consistency in the 21cm global signal

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06762
 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new observable for the 21cm global signal during the dark ages, the dark-age consistency ratio, which is motivated from the fact that the shape of the functional form of the brightness temperature against the frequency is cosmological-parameter independent in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The dark-age consistency ratio takes a certain definite value in the $\Lambda$CDM case, which can serve as a critical test of the model and probe those beyond the standard one. The new observable just needs measurements of the brightness temperature at a few frequency bands during the dark ages, and thus it allows us to test cosmological scenarios even with limited information on the global signal.
#### Understanding Molecular Abundances in Star-Forming Regions Using  Interpretable Machine Learning

 - **Abstract**
 Astrochemical modelling of the interstellar medium typically makes use of complex computational codes with parameters whose values can be varied. It is not always clear what the exact nature of the relationship is between these input parameters and the output molecular abundances. In this work, a feature importance analysis is conducted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), an interpretable machine learning technique, to identify the most important physical parameters as well as their relationship with each output. The outputs are the abundances of species and ratios of abundances. In order to reduce the time taken for this process, a neural network emulator is trained to model each species' output abundance and this emulator is used to perform the interpretable machine learning. SHAP is then used to further explore the relationship between the physical features and the abundances for the various species and ratios we considered. \ce{H2O} and CO's gas phase abundances are found to strongly depend on the metallicity. \ce{NH3} has a strong temperature dependence, with there being two temperature regimes (< 100 K and > 100K). By analysing the chemical network, we relate this to the chemical reactions in our network and find the increased temperature results in increased efficiency of destruction pathways. We investigate the HCN/HNC ratio and show that it can be used as a cosmic thermometer, agreeing with the literature. This ratio is also found to be correlated with the metallicity. The HCN/CS ratio serves as a density tracer, but also has three separate temperature-dependence regimes, which are linked to the chemistry of the two molecules.
#### Resolving the Hubble tension at late times with Dark Energy

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06795
 - **Abstract**
 Within the standard cosmological model, the presence of Dark Energy (DE) is the only structural difference between the early and late times Universe. While its presence is in full display at late times, it is irrelevant at early times, especially when all other physical ingredients of the standard model are contributing to the formation of CMB anisotropies. This makes DE a natural candidate to try to solve cosmological tensions between measurements from these two different epochs. We will analyze how DE presence affects relevant cosmological observables and how it could change them. This will allow us to discuss how late-time measurements constrain DE models that aim to resolve the Hubble constant tension and the achievable performances of these models.

 - **Abstract**
 Most stars are born in dense stellar environments where the formation and early evolution of planetary systems may be significantly perturbed by encounters with neighbouring stars. To investigate on the fate of circumstellar gas disks and planets around young stars dense stellar environments, we numerically evolve star-disk-planet systems. We use the $N$-body codes NBODY6++GPU and SnIPES for the dynamical evolution of the stellar population, and the SPH-based code GaSPH for the dynamical evolution of protoplanetary disks. The secular evolution of a planetary system in a cluster differs from that of a field star. Most stellar encounters are tidal, adiabatic and nearly-parabolic. The parameters that characterize the impact of an encounter include the orientation of the protoplanetary disk and planet relative to the orbit of the encountering star, and the orbital phase and the semi-major axis of the planet. We investigate this dependence for close encounters ($r_p/a\leq 100$, where $r_p$ is the periastron distance of the encountering star and $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet). We also investigate distant perturbers ($r_p/a\gg 100$), which have a moderate effect on the dynamical evolution of the planet and the protoplanetary disk. We find that the evolution of protoplanetary disks in star clusters differs significantly from that of isolated systems. When interpreting the outcome of the planet formation process, it is thus important to consider their birth environments.
#### A Strong Blend in the Morning: Studying the Circumgalactic Medium Before  Cosmic Noon with Strong, Blended Lyman-$α$ Forest Systems

 - **Abstract**
 We study of the properties of a new class of circumgalactic medium absorbers identified in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest: "Strong, Blended Lyman-$\alpha$" (or SBLA) absorption systems. We study SBLAs at $2.4<z<3.1$ in SDSS-IV/eBOSS spectra by their strong extended Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption complexes covering 138 km/s with an integrated $\log (N_{HI}/$cm$^{-2}) =16.04^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$ and Doppler parameter $b=18.1^{+0.7}_{-0.4}$ km/s. Clustering with the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest provides a large-scale structure bias of $b = 2.34\pm0.06$ and halo mass estimate of $M_h \approx 10^{12}{\rm h^{-1}M_{sol}}$ for our SBLA sample. We measure the ensemble mean column densities of 22 metal features in the SBLA composite spectrum and find that no single-population multiphase model for them is viable. We therefore explore the underlying SBLA population by forward modelling the SBLA absorption distribution. Based on covariance measurements and favoured populations we find that $\approx 25$% of our SBLAs have stronger metals. Using silicon only we find that our strong metal SBLAs trace gas with a $\log(n_H / $cm$^{-3}) > -2.45$ for $T=10^{3.5}$K and show gas clumping on $<255$ parsec scales. We fit multiphase models to this strong sub-population and find a low ionization phase with $n_H=1$cm$^{-3}$, $T=10^{3.5}$K and $[X/H]=0.8$, an intermediate ionization phase with $\log(n_H / $cm$^{-3}) = -3.35$, $T=10^{3.5}$K and $[X/H]=-1.1$, and a poorly constrained higher ionization phase. We find that the low ionization phase traces cold, dense super-solar metallicity gas with a clumping scale of just 0.009 parsecs.
#### Detecting molecules in Ariel low resolution transmission spectra

 - **Abstract**
 The Ariel Space Mission aims to observe a diverse sample of exoplanet atmospheres across a wide wavelength range of 0.5 to 7.8 microns. The observations are organized into four Tiers, with Tier 1 being a reconnaissance survey. This Tier is designed to achieve a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) at low spectral resolution in order to identify featureless spectra or detect key molecular species without necessarily constraining their abundances with high confidence. We introduce a P-statistic that uses the abundance posteriors from a spectral retrieval to infer the probability of a molecule's presence in a given planet's atmosphere in Tier 1. We find that this method predicts probabilities that correlate well with the input abundances, indicating considerable predictive power when retrieval models have comparable or higher complexity compared to the data. However, we also demonstrate that the P-statistic loses representativity when the retrieval model has lower complexity, expressed as the inclusion of fewer than the expected molecules. The reliability and predictive power of the P-statistic are assessed on a simulated population of exoplanets with H2-He dominated atmospheres, and forecasting biases are studied and found not to adversely affect the classification of the survey.
#### Unveiling the X-ray polarimetric properties of LMC X-3 with IXPE, NICER,  and Swift/XRT

 - **Abstract**
 The incoming Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observations of X-ray binaries provide a new tool to investigate the underlying accretion geometry. Here we report the first measurements of X-ray polarization of the extra-galactic black-hole X-ray binary LMC X$-$3. We find a polarization fraction of $\sim$ 3 % at a polarization angle of $\sim 135^\circ$ in the $2-8$ keV energy band with statistical significance at the 7$\sigma$ level. This polarization measurement significantly exceeds the minimum detectable polarization threshold of 1.2 % for the source, ascertained at a 99 % confidence level within the $2-8$ keV energy band. The simultaneous spectro-polarimetric fitting of NICER, Swift/XRT, and IXPE revealed the presence of a disc with a temperature of 1 keV and a Comptonized component with a power-law index of 2.4, confirming the soft nature of the source. The polarization degree increases with energy from $\sim$3 % in the $2-5$ keV band to $\sim$8 % in the $5-8$ keV band, while the polarization angle is energy independent. The observed energy dependence and the sudden jump of polarization fraction at $\sim$ 5 keV supports the idea of a static slab coronal geometry for the comptonizing medium of LMC X$-$3. We further observed no change in the polarization properties with time over the period of the IXPE observations.
#### Spectral Analysis of the LMXB XTE J1810-189 with NICER Data

 - **Abstract**
 XTE J1810-189 is a Low-Mass X-ray Binary transient system hosting a neutron star, which underwent a three-month-long outburst in 2020. In order to study its spectral evolution during this outburst, we analysed all the available observations performed by NICER, in the 1-10 keV energy band. Firstly, we fitted the spectra with a thermal Comptonisation model. Our analysis revealed the lack of a significant direct emission from a black-body-like component, therefore we calculated the optical depth of the Comptonising region, deriving an upper limit of 4.5, which suggests the presence of a moderately thick corona. We also attempted to fit the spectrum with an alternative model, i.e. a cold Comptonised emission from a disc and a direct thermal component from the neutron star, finding a similarly good fit. The source did not enter a full high luminosity/soft state throughout the outburst, with a photon index ranging from 1.7 to 2.2, and an average unabsorbed flux in the 1-10 keV band of 3.6x10^(-10) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1). We searched for the presence of Fe K-shell emission lines in the range 6.4-7 keV, significantly detecting a broad component only in a couple of observations. Finally, we conducted a time-resolved spectral analysis of the detected type-I X-ray burst, observed during the outburst, finding no evidence of a photospheric radius expansion. The type-I burst duration suggests a mix of H/He fuel.
#### First detection of X-ray polarization in thermal state of LMC X-3:  Spectro-polarimetric study with IXPE

 - **Abstract**
 We report a comprehensive spectro-polarimetric study of the black hole binary LMC X$-3$ using simultaneous {\it IXPE}, {\it NICER} and {\it NuSTAR} observations in $0.5-20$ keV energy band. The broad-band energy spectrum ($0.5-20$ keV) with {\it NICER} and {\it NuSTAR} is well described by the disc emission of temperature $\sim 1.1$ keV and a weak Compotonizing tail beyond $\sim 10$ keV. This evidently suggests a disc-dominated spectral state of the source with disc contribution of $\sim 96\%$. The lack of variability ($rms \sim 0.5\%$) in the power density spectrum further corroborates the high/soft nature of the source. A significant polarization degree (PD) of $3.04 \pm 0.40\%$ ($ > 7\sigma$) at a polarization angle (PA) of $-44.24^{\circ} \pm 3.77^{\circ}$ ($> 7\sigma$) is found in $2-8$ keV energy range of {\it IXPE}. In addition, the degree of polarization is seen to increase with energy up to $\sim 4.35 \pm 0.98\%$ ($> 3\sigma$) in $4-8$ keV band. Further, we attempt to constrain the spin ($a_{*}$) of the source using broad-band spectral modelling that indicates a weakly rotating black hole in LMC X$-3$ with $a_{*} = 0.295_{-0.021}^{+0.008}-0.273_{-0.012}^{+0.011}$ ($90\%$ confidence). Based on the spectro-polarimetric results, we infer that the polarization in LMC X$-3$ is resulted possibly due to the combined effects of the direct and/or reflected emissions from a partially ionized disc atmosphere. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the above findings.

 - **Abstract**
 The youngest known Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) G1.9+0.3 has high-velocity supernova shock beyond 10000 km s-1, and it is considered to be one of the major candidates of a PeVatron. Despite these outstanding properties, the surrounding interstellar matter of this object is poorly understood. We investigated the interstellar gas toward G1.9+0.3 using the 12CO(J=3-2) data with the angular resolution of 15" obtained by the CHIMPS2 survey by the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, and discovered three individual clouds at -1, 7, and 45 km s-1. From its morphological and velocity structures, the -1 km s-1 cloud, having the largest velocity width >20 km s-1 and located at the distance of the Galactic Center, is possibly associated with the SNR. The associated cloud shows a cavity structure both in space and velocity and coincides well with the SNR. We found that the associated cloud has higher column densities toward three bright, radio synchrotron-emitted rims where the radial expansion velocity of the supernova shock is decelerated, and the cloud is faint in the other parts of the SNR. This is the first direct evidence indicating that the highly anisotropic expansion of G1.9+0.3 observed by previous studies results from the deceleration by the interaction between the supernova shock and surrounding dense interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Wide binaries play a crucial role in analyzing the birth environment of stars and the dynamical evolution of clusters. When wide binaries are located at greater distances, their companions may overlap in the observed images, becoming indistinguishable and resulting in unresolved wide binaries, which are difficult to detect using traditional methods. Utilizing deep learning, we present a method to identify unresolved wide binaries by analyzing the point-spread function (PSF) morphology of telescopes. Our trained model demonstrates exceptional performance in differentiating between single stars and unresolved binaries with separations ranging from 0.1 to 2 physical pixels, where the PSF FWHM is ~2 pixels, achieving an accuracy of 97.2% for simulated data from the Chinese Space Station Telescope. We subsequently tested our method on photometric data of NGC 6121 observed by the Hubble Space Telescope. The trained model attained an accuracy of 96.5% and identified 18 wide binary candidates with separations between 7 and 140 au. The majority of these wide binary candidates are situated outside the core radius of NGC 6121, suggesting that they are likely first-generation stars, which is in general agreement with the results of Monte Carlo simulations. Our PSF-based method shows great promise in detecting unresolved wide binaries and is well suited for observations from space-based telescopes with stable PSF. In the future, we aim to apply our PSF-based method to next-generation surveys such as the China Space Station Optical Survey, where a larger-field-of-view telescope will be capable of identifying a greater number of such wide binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 Direct-sampling observations of interstellar neutral (ISN) species and their secondary populations inform on the physical state of the local interstellar medium and processes operating in the outer heliosheath. Such observations are performed from Earth's orbit by the IBEX-Lo experiment on board the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission. IBEX ISN viewing is restricted to directions close to perpendicular to the Earth-Sun line, which limits the observations of interstellar species to several months during the year. A greatly improved data set will be possible for the upcoming IMAP mission due to a novel concept of putting the IMAP-Lo detector on a pivot platform that varies the angle of observation relative to the Sun-Earth line and the detector boresight, as planned for the IMAP-Lo instrument on the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) mission (McComas et al. 2018). Here we suggest a 2 year scenario for varying the viewing angle in such a way that all the necessary atom components can be observed sufficiently well to achieve the science goals of nominal IMAP mission. This scenario facilitates, among others, removal of the correlation of the inflow parameters of interstellar gas, unambiguous analysis of the primary and secondary populations of interstellar He, Ne and O, and determination of the ionization rates of He and Ne free of possible calibration bias. The scheme is operationally simple, provides a good counting statistics, and synergizes observations of interstellar species and heliospheric energetic neutral atoms.

 - **Abstract**
 A Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) occurs when a supermassive black hole tidally disrupt a nearby passing star. The fallback accretion rate of the disrupted star may exceed the Eddington limit, which induces a supersonic outflow and a burst of luminosity, similar to an explosive event. Thus, TDEs can be detected as very luminous transients, and the number of observations for such events is increasing rapidly. In this paper we fit 20 TDE light curves with TiDE, a new public, object-oriented code designed to model optical TDE light curves. We compare our results with those obtained by the popular MOSFiT and the recently developed TDEmass codes, and discuss the possible sources of differences.

 - **Abstract**
 Sensitivity forecasts inform the design of experiments and the direction of theoretical efforts. We argue that to arrive at representative results Bayesian forecasts should marginalize their conclusions over uncertain parameters and noise realizations rather than picking fiducial values. However, this is computationally infeasible with current methods. We thus propose a novel simulation-based forecasting methodology, which we find to be capable of providing expedient rigorous forecasts without relying on restrictive assumptions.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the gravitational bremsstrahlung owing to collisions mediated by a $1/r$ potential. We combine classical and first order Born approximation results in order to construct an approximate gravitational `Gaunt factor' for the total emitted energy. We also obtain the cross-section with an angular momentum cut-off, and hence the cross-section for emission via close hyperbolic encounters in a gravitating cluster. These effects are the dominant source of very high frequency gravitational noise in the solar system. The total gravitational wave power of the Sun is $76\pm 20\,$MW.

 - **Abstract**
 The Reheating era of inflationary Universe can be parameterized by various parameters like reheating temperature $T_{\text{re}}$, reheating duration $N_{\text{re}}$ and average equation of state parameter $\overline{\omega }_{\text{re}}$, which can be constrained by observationally feasible values of scalar power spectral amplitude $A_{\text{s}}$ and spectral index $n_{\text{s}}$. In this work, by considering the quadratic chaotic inflationary potential with logarithmic-correction in mass, we examine the reheating era in order to place some limits on model's parameter space. By investigating the reheating epoch using Planck's 2018 data, we show that even a small correction can make the quadratic chaotic model consistent with latest cosmological observations. We also find that the study of reheating era helps to put much tighter constraints on model and effectively improves accuracy of model.

 - **Abstract**
 Drastic changes in protoplanets' orbits could occur in the early stages of planetary systems through interactions with other planets and their surrounding protoplanetary or debris discs. The resulting planetary system could exhibit orbits with moderate to high eccentricities and/or inclinations, causing planets to perturb one another as well as the disc significantly. The present work studies the evolution of systems composed of an initially inclined planet and a debris disc. We perform N-body simulations of a narrow, self-gravitating debris disc and a single interior Neptune-like planet. We simulate systems with various initial planetary inclinations, from coplanar to polar configurations considering different separations between the planet and the disc. We find that except when the planet is initially on a polar orbit, the planet-disc system tends to reach a quasi-coplanar configuration with low vertical dispersion in the disc. When present, the Zeipel--Kozai--Lidov oscillations induced by the disc pump the planet's eccentricity and, in turn, affect the disc structure. We also find that the resulting disc morphology in most of the simulations looks very similar in both radial and vertical directions once the simulations are converged. This contrasts strongly with massless disc simulations, where vertical disc dispersion is set by the initial disc-planet inclination and can be high for initially highly inclined planets. The results suggest caution in interpreting an unseen planet's dynamical history based only on the disc's appearance.

 - **Abstract**
 Nonlinear pulsation modeling of classical variable stars is among the first topics which were developed at the beginning of the computational era. Various developments were made, and many questions were answered in the past 60 years, and the models became more complex, describing the genuinely 3D convection in a single dimension. Despite its successes, the recent public availability of the MESA Radial Stellar Pulsations (MESA RSP) module and the emerging results from multidimensional codes made clear that the 8 free convective parameters, unique to these models, together with the underlying physical models need calibration. This could be done by comparing them against multi-dimensional codes, but before that, it is important to scrutinize the free parameters of the 1D codes using observations. This is a follow-up work of our previous calibration on the convective parameters of the Budapest-Florida and MESA RSP pulsation codes for RRab stars. In this paper, we extend the previous calibration to the RRc stars and the RR Lyrae stars in general. We found that correlations of some of the parameters are present in RRc stars as well but have a different nature, while high-temperature RRc stars' pulsation properties are very sensitive to the chosen parameter sets.
#### JWST imaging of edge-on protoplanetary disks. I. Fully vertically mixed  10$μ$m grains in the outer regions of a 1000 au disk

 - **Abstract**
 Scattered light imaging of protoplanetary disks provides key insights on the geometry and dust properties in the disk surface. Here we present JWST 2--21\,$\mu$m images of a 1000\,au-radius edge-on protoplanetary disk surrounding an 0.4\,$M_\odot$ young star in Taurus, 2MASS\,J04202144+2813491. These observations represent the longest wavelengths at which a protoplanetary disk is spatially resolved in scattered light. We combine these observations with HST optical images and ALMA continuum and CO mapping. We find that the changes in the scattered light disk morphology are remarkably small across a factor of 30 in wavelength, indicating that dust in the disk surface layers is characterized by an almost gray opacity law. Using radiative transfer models, we conclude that grains up to $\gtrsim10\,\mu$m in size are fully coupled to the gas in this system, whereas grains $\gtrsim100\,\mu$m are strongly settled towards the midplane. Further analyses of these observations, and similar ones of other edge-on disks, will provide strong empirical constraints on disk dynamics and evolution and grain growth models. In addition, the 7.7 and 12.\,$\mu$m JWST images reveal an X-shaped feature located above the warm molecular layer traced by CO line emission. The highest elevations at which this feature is detectable roughly match the maximal extent of the disk in visible wavelength scattered light as well as of an unusual kinematic signature in CO. We propose that these phenomena could be related to a disk wind entraining small dust grains.

 - **Abstract**
 The optical spectra of novae are characterized by emission lines from the hydrogen Balmer series and either Fe II or He/N, leading to their traditional classification into two spectral classes: "Fe II" and "He/N". For decades, the origins of these spectral features were discussed in the literature in the contexts of different bodies of gas or changes in the opacity of the ejecta, particularly associated with studies by R. E. Williams and S. N. Shore. Here, we revisit these major studies with dedicated, modern data sets, covering the evolution of several novae from early rise to peak all the way to the nebular phase. Our data confirm previous suggestions in the literature that the "Fe II" and "He/N" spectral classes are phases in the spectroscopic evolution of novae driven primarily by changes in the opacity, ionization, and density of the ejecta, and most if not all novae go through at least three spectroscopic phases as their eruptions evolve: an early He/N (phase 1; observed during the early rise to visible peak and characterized by P Cygni lines of He I, N II, and N III), then an Fe II (phase 2; observed near visible peak and characterized by P Cygni lines of Fe II and O I), and then a later He/N (phase 3; observed during the decline and characterized by emission lines of He I. He II, N II, and N III), before entering the nebular phase. This spectral evolution seems to be ubiquitous across novae, regardless of their speed class; however the duration of each of these phase differs based on the speed class of the nova.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Keck Infrared Transient Survey (KITS), a NASA Key Strategic Mission Support program to obtain near-infrared (NIR) spectra of astrophysical transients of all types, and its first data release, consisting of 105 NIR spectra of 50 transients. Such a data set is essential as we enter a new era of IR astronomy with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman). NIR spectral templates will be essential to search JWST images for stellar explosions of the first stars and to plan an effective Roma} SN Ia cosmology survey, both key science objectives for mission success. Between 2022 February and 2023 July, we systematically obtained 274 NIR spectra of 146 astronomical transients, representing a significant increase in the number of available NIR spectra in the literature. The first data release includes data from the 2022A semester. We systematically observed three samples: a flux-limited sample that includes all transients $<$17 mag in a red optical band (usually ZTF r or ATLAS o bands); a volume-limited sample including all transients within redshift $z < 0.01$ ($D \approx 50$ Mpc); and an SN Ia sample targeting objects at phases and light-curve parameters that had scant existing NIR data in the literature. The flux-limited sample is 39% complete (60% excluding SNe Ia), while the volume-limited sample is 54% complete and is 79% complete to $z = 0.005$. All completeness numbers will rise with the inclusion of data from other telescopes in future data releases. Transient classes observed include common Type Ia and core-collapse supernovae, tidal disruption events (TDEs), luminous red novae, and the newly categorized hydrogen-free/helium-poor interacting Type Icn supernovae. We describe our observing procedures and data reduction using Pypeit, which requires minimal human interaction to ensure reproducibility.
