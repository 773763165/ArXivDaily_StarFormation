 - **Abstract**
 One of the biggest puzzles regarding the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is the structure of its cool ($T\sim10^4$ K) gas phase. While the kinematics of quasar absorption systems suggests the CGM is composed of a population of different clouds, constraining the clouds' extent and spatial distribution has proven challenging, both from the theoretical and observational points of view. In this work we study the spatial structure of the $z\sim 1$ CGM with unprecedented detail via resolved spectroscopy of giant gravitational arcs. We put together a sample of Mg II$\lambda\lambda 2796,2803$ detections obtained with VLT/MUSE in 91 spatially independent and contiguous sight-lines toward 3 arcs, each probing an isolated star-forming galaxy believed to be detected in absorption. We constrain the coherence scale of this gas ($C_{\rm{length}}$), which represents the spatial scale over which the Mg II equivalent width (EW) remains constant, by comparing EW variations measured across all sight-lines with empirical models. We find $1.4 <C_{\rm{length}}/\rm{kpc} <7.8$ (95% confidence). This measurement, of unprecedented accuracy, represents the scale over which the cool gas tends to cluster in separate structures. We argue that, if $C_{\rm{length}}$ is a universal property of the CGM, it needs to be reproduced by current and future theoretical models in order to understand the exact role of this medium in galaxy evolution.
#### Spikes and accretion of unbound, collisionless matter around black holes

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the steady-state density and velocity dispersion profiles of collisionless matter around a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) and its associated rate of accretion onto the BH. We treat matter, which could be stars or dark matter particles, whose orbits are {\it unbound} to the BH, but still governed by its gravitational field. We consider two opposite spatial geometries for the matter distributions: an infinite, 3D cluster and a 2D razor-thin disk, both with zero net angular momentum. We demonstrate that the results depend critically on the adopted geometry, even in the absence of angular momentum. We adopt a simple monoenergetic, isotropic, phase-space distribution function for the matter as a convenient example to illustrate this dependence. The effect of breaking strict isotropy by incorporating an unreplenished loss cone due to BH capture of low-angular momentum matter is also considered. Calculations are all analytic and performed in full general relativity, though key results are also evaluated in the Newtonian limit. We consider one application to show that the rate of BH accretion from an ambient cluster can be significantly less than that from a thin disk to which it may collapse, although both rates are considerably smaller than Bondi accretion for a (collisional) fluid with a similar asymptotic particle density and velocity dispersion (i.e., sound speed).
#### Cosmoglobe DR1. III. First full-sky model of polarized synchrotron  emission from all WMAP and Planck LFI data

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first model of full-sky polarized synchrotron emission that is derived from all WMAP and Planck LFI frequency maps. The basis of this analysis is the set of end-to-end reprocessed Cosmoglobe Data Release 1 sky maps presented in a companion paper, which have significantly lower instrumental systematics than the legacy products from each experiment. We find that the resulting polarized synchrotron amplitude map has an average noise rms of $3.2\,\mathrm{\mu K}$ at 30 GHz and $2^{\circ}$ FWHM, which is 30% lower than the recently released BeyondPlanck model that included only LFI+WMAP Ka-V data, and 29% lower than the WMAP K-band map alone. The mean $B$-to-$E$ power spectrum ratio is $0.40\pm0.02$, with amplitudes consistent with those measured previously by Planck and QUIJOTE. Assuming a power law model for the synchrotron spectral energy distribution, and using the $T$--$T$ plot method, we find a full-sky inverse noise-variance weighted mean of $\beta_{\mathrm{s}}=-3.07\pm0.07$ between Cosmoglobe DR1 K-band and 30 GHz, in good agreement with previous estimates. In summary, the novel Cosmoglobe DR1 synchrotron model is both more sensitive and systematically cleaner than similar previous models, and it has a more complete error description that is defined by a set of Monte Carlo posterior samples. We believe that these products are preferable over previous Planck and WMAP products for all synchrotron-related scientific applications, including simulation, forecasting and component separation.
#### Nebular C IV 1550 Imaging of the Metal-Poor Starburst Mrk 71: Direct  Evidence of Catastrophic Cooling

 - **Abstract**
 We use the Hubble Space Telescope ACS camera to obtain the first spatially resolved, nebular imaging in the light of C IV 1548,1551 by using the F150LP and F165LP filters. These observations of the local starburst Mrk 71 in NGC 2366 show emission apparently originating within the interior cavity around the dominant super star cluster (SSC), Knot A. Together with imaging in He II 4686 and supporting STIS FUV spectroscopy, the morphology and intensity of the C IV nebular surface brightness and the C IV / He II ratio map provide direct evidence that the mechanical feedback is likely dominated by catastrophic radiative cooling, which strongly disrupts adiabatic superbubble evolution. The implied extreme mass loading and low kinetic efficiency of the cluster wind are reasonably consistent with the wind energy budget, which is probably enhanced by radiation pressure. In contrast, the Knot B SSC lies within a well-defined superbubble with associated soft X-rays and He II 1640 emission, which are signatures of adiabatic, energy-driven feedback from a supernova-driven outflow. This system lacks clear evidence of C IV from the limb-brightened shell, as expected for this model, but the observations may not be deep enough to confirm its presence. We also detect a small C IV-emitting object that is likely an embedded compact H II region. Its C IV emission may indicate the presence of very massive stars (> 100 M_sun) or strongly pressure-confined stellar feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 Here we investigate the giant radio galaxy DA 240, which is a FR II source. Specifically, we investigate its flux density, as well as the spectral index distribution. For that purpose, we used publicly available data for the source: Leahy's atlas of double radio-sources and NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED). We used observations at 326 MHz (92 cm) and at 608 MHz (49 cm) and obtained spectral index distributions between 326 and 608 MHz. For the first time we give spectral index map for these frequencies. We found that the synchrotron radiation is the dominant radiation mechanism over most of the area of DA 240, and also investigated the mechanism of radiation at some characteristic points, namely its core and the hotspots. The results of this study will be helpful for understanding the evolutionary process of the DA 240 radio source.

 - **Abstract**
 Very-high-energy neutrinos can be observed by detecting air shower signals. Detection of transient target of opportunity (ToO) neutrino sources is part of a broader multimessenger program. The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) Mission, launched on May 12, 2023, was equipped with an optical Cherenkov Telescope (CT) designed to detect up-going air showers sourced by Earth-skimming neutrinos that interact near the Earth's limb. Presented here is an overview of the sky coverage and ToO scheduler software for EUSO-SPB2. By using the balloon trajectory coordinates and setting constraints on the positions of the Sun and Moon to ensure dark skies, we can determine if and when a source direction is slightly below the Earth's limb. From a source catalog, CT scheduling and pointing is performed to optimize the search for high-energy neutrinos coming from astrophysical sources. Some sample results for EUSO-SPB2 are shown.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of a disturbed accretion disk holds great significance in the realm of astrophysics. This is because such events play a crucial role in revealing the nature of disk structure, the release of energy, and the generated shock waves. Thus, they can help explain the causes of X-ray emissions observed in black hole accretion disk systems. In this paper, we perturb the stable disk formed by spherical accretion around Kerr and EGB black holes. This perturbation reveals one- and two-armed spiral shock waves on the disk's surface. We find a strong connection between these waves and the black hole's spin parameter (a/M) and the EGB coupling constant ($\alpha$). Specifically, we found that as alpha increases in the negative direction, the dynamics of the disk and the waves become more chaotic. Additionally, we observe that the angular momentum of the perturbing matter significantly affects mass accretion and the oscillation of the arising shock waves. This allows us to observe changes in QPOs frequencies. Particularly, perturbations with angular momentum matches the observed C-type QPOs frequencies of GRS 1915 + 105 source. Thus, we conclude that the possibility of the shock waves occurring within the vicinity of GRS 1915 + 105 is substantial.

 - **Abstract**
 Cotesta et al. (2022) reanalyze the GW150914 ringdown, arguing against the presence of an overtone and suggesting claims of its detection in Isi et al. (2019) were driven by noise. Here we point out a number of technical errors in that analysis, including a software bug, and show that features highlighted as problematic are in fact expected and encountered in simulated data. After fixes, the code in used in Cotesta et al. (2022) produces results consistent with the presence of the overtone. All code and data are available at https://github.com/maxisi/gw150914_rd_comment

 - **Abstract**
 We present the combination of ALMA-IMF and single-dish continuum images from the Mustang-2 Galactic Plane Survey (MGPS90) at 3 millimeters and the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) at 1 millimeter. Six and ten out of the fiffteen ALMA-IMF fields are combined with MGPS90 and BGPS, respectively. The combination is made via the feathering technique. We used the dendrogram algorithm throughout the combined images, and performed further analysis in the six fields with combination in both bands (G012.80, W43-MM1, W43-MM2, W43-MM3, W51-E, W51-IRS2). In these fields, we calculated spectral index maps and used them to separate regions dominated by dust or free-free emission, and then performed further structural analysis. We report the basic physical parameters of the dust-dominated (column densities, masses) and ionized (emission measures, hydrogen ionization photon rates) structures. We also searched for multi-scale relations in the dust-dominated structures across the analyzed fields, finding that the fraction of mass in dendrogram leaves (which we label as "Leaf Mass Eficiency", LME) as a function of molecular gas column density follows a similar trend: a rapid, exponential-like growth, with maximum values approaching 100% in most cases. The observed behaviour of the LME with gas column is tentatively interpreted as an indicator of large star formation activity within the ALMA-IMF protoclusters. W51-E and G012.80 stand out as cases with comparatively large and reduced potential for further star formation, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Since current challenges faced by $\Lambda$CDM might be hinting at new unravelled physics, here we investigate a plausible cosmological model where a vector field acts as source of dark energy. In particular, we examine whether an energy-momentum exchange between dark energy and dark matter could provide an explanation for current discrepancies in cosmological parameters. We carefully work out equations governing both background and linear order perturbations and implement them in a Boltzmann code. We found that a negative coupling makes the dark energy equation of state less negative and closer to a cosmological constant during the matter dominated epoch than an uncoupled vector dark energy model. While the effect of the coupling is hardly noticeable on the growth of matter density perturbations, matter velocity perturbations are enhanced at late-times when dark energy dominates. Therefore, data of redshift space distortions help to narrow down these kinds of couplings in the dark sector. We computed cosmological constraints and found common parameters also present in $\Lambda$CDM are in good agreement with the Planck Collaboration baseline result. However, our best fit predicts a much higher growth rate of matter perturbations at low redshift, thus exacerbating the disagreement with redshift space distortions data. We conclude that our coupled vector dark energy model does not solve current tensions (i.e., $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$). Moreover, having three additional parameters with respect to $\Lambda$CDM, the coupled vector dark energy model is heavily disfavoured by Bayesian evidence.
#### The Intensity of the Diffuse Galactic Emission Reflected by the Meteor  Trails

 - **Abstract**
 We calculate the reflection of diffuse galactic emission by meteor trails and investigate its potential relationship to Meteor Radio Afterglow (MRA). The formula to calculate the reflection of diffuse galactic emission is derived from a simplified case, assuming that the signals are mirrored by the cylindrical over-dense ionization trail of meteors. The overall observed reflection is simulated through a ray tracing algorithm together with the diffuse galactic emission modelled by the GSM sky model. We demonstrate that the spectrum of the reflected signal is broadband and follows a power law with a negative spectral index of around -1.3. The intensity of the reflected signal varies with local sidereal time and the brightness of the meteor and can reach 2000 Jy. These results agree with some previous observations of MRAs. Therefore, we think that the reflection of galactic emission by meteor trails can be a possible mechanism causing MRAs, which is worthy of further research.
#### Composition and thermal properties of Ganymede's surface from  JWST/NIRSpec and MIRI observations

 - **Abstract**
 JWST NIRSpec IFU (2.9-5.3 mu) and MIRI MRS (4.9-28.5 mu) observations were performed on both the leading and trailing hemispheres of Ganymede with a spectral resolution of ~2700. Reflectance spectra show signatures of water ice, CO2 and H2O2. An absorption feature at 5.9 mu is revealed and is tentatively assigned to sulfuric acid hydrates. The CO2 4.26-mu band shows latitudinal and longitudinal variations in depth, shape and position over the two hemispheres, unveiling different CO2 physical states. In the ice-rich polar regions, which are the most exposed to Jupiter's plasma irradiation, the CO2 band is redshifted with respect to other terrains. In the leading northern polar cap, the CO2 band is dominated by a high wavelength component at ~4.27 mu, consistent with CO2 trapped in amorphous water ice. At equatorial latitudes (and especially on dark terrains) the observed band is broader and shifted towards the blue, suggesting CO2 adsorbed on non-icy materials. Amorphous ice is detected in the ice-rich polar regions, and is especially abundant on the leading northern polar cap. In both hemispheres the north polar cap ice appears to be more processed than the south polar cap. A longitudinal modification of the H2O ice molecular structure and/or nano/micrometre-scale texture, of diurnal or geographic origin, is observed in both hemispheres. Ice frost is observed on the morning limb of the trailing hemisphere, possibly formed during the night from the recondensation of water subliming from the warmer subsurface. Reflectance spectra of the dark terrains are compatible with the presence of Na-/Mg-sulfate salts, sulfuric acid hydrates, and possibly phyllosilicates mixed with fine-grained opaque minerals, having an highly porous texture. Mid-IR brightness temperatures indicate a rough surface and a very low thermal inertia of 20-40 J m-2 s-0.5 K-1, consistent with a porous surface.
#### Investigating Protostellar Accretion across the mass spectrum with the  JWST: discovery of a collimated jet from the low luminosity protostar IRAS  16253-2429 in a quiescent accretion phase

 - **Abstract**
 Investigating Protostellar Accretion (IPA) is a JWST Cycle 1 GO program that used NIRSpec IFU and MIRI MRS to obtain 2.9--28~$\mu$m spectral cubes of young, deeply embedded, protostars with luminosities of 0.2 to 10,000~L$_{\odot}$ and central masses of 0.15 to 12~M$_{\odot}$. In this Letter, we report the discovery of a highly collimated atomic jet from the Class 0 protostar IRAS~16253-2429, the lowest luminosity (mass) source in the IPA program. The collimated jet is clearly detected in multiple [Fe~II] lines, [Ne~II], [Ni~II], and H~I lines, but not in molecular emission. From our analysis, we find that the atomic jet has a velocity of about 169~$\pm$~15~km\,s$^{-1}$, after correcting for inclination. The width of the jet increases with distance from the central protostar from 23 to~60 au, corresponding to an opening angle of 2.6~$\pm$~0.5\arcdeg. By comparing the measured flux ratios of various fine structure lines to those predicted by simple shock models, we derive a shock velocity of 54~km\,s$^{-1}$ and a preshock density of 2.0$\times10^{3}$~cm$^{-3}$ at the base of the jet. From these quantities, and assuming a cylindrical cross-section for the jet, we derive an upper limit for the mass loss rate from the protostar of 1.1$\times10^{-10}~M_{\odot}$~yr~$^{-1}$. The low mass loss rate is consistent with simultaneous measurements of low mass accretion rate ($\sim 1.3 \times 10^{-9}~M_{\odot}$~yr~$^{-1}$) for IRAS~16253-2429 from JWST observations (Watson et al. in prep), indicating that the protostar is in a quiescent accretion phase. Our results demonstrate that very low-mass protostars can drive highly collimated, atomic jets, even during the quiescent phase.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar turbulence shapes the HI distribution in the Milky Way (MW). How this affects large-scale statistical properties of HI column density across the MW remains largely unconstrained. We use approx 13,000 square-degree GALFA-HI survey to map statistical fluctuations of HI over the 40 km s-1 velocity range. We calculate the spatial power spectrum (SPS) of HI column density image by running a 3-degree kernel and measuring SPS slope over a range of angular scales from 16 arcmin to 20 degree. Due to GALFA complex observing and calibration strategy, we construct detailed estimates of the noise contribution and account for GALFA beam effects on SPS. This allows us to systematically analyze HI images that trace a wide range of interstellar environments. We find that SPS slope varies between -2.6 at high Galactic latitudes, and -3.2 close to Galactic plane. The range of SPS slope values becomes tighter when we consider HI optical depth and line-of-sight length caused by the plane-parallel geometry of HI disk. This relatively uniform, large-scale distribution of SPS slope is suggestive of large-scale turbulent driving being a dominant mechanism for shaping HI structures in the MW and/or the stellar feedback turbulence being efficiently dissipated within dense molecular clouds. Only at latitudes above 60 degrees we find evidence for HI SPS slope being consistently more shallow. Those directions are largely within the Local Bubble, suggesting the recent history of this cavity, shaped by multiple supernovae explosions, has modified the turbulent state of HI and/or fractions of HI phases.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond radio signals from cosmological distances. As they propagate, FRBs can interact with ambient photons and initiate a quantum cascade that can limit the electric field strength. This paper examines whether some observed bright and brief FRBs may challenge this limit if the source is not relativistic. The size of a static FRB source is estimated as $R\sim ct$, where $t$ is the time scale of the FRB and $c$ denotes the speed of light. But for a relativistic source moving at the Lorentz factor $\Gamma$, the size is $R \sim 2 \Gamma^2 c t $. Using an FRB catalog, we plot the luminosity-duration distribution. Most FRBs fall below the limit for a static source, but two events have higher luminosity and shorter duration. This suggests these bursts may originate from relativistic sources, although more data is needed to confirm this.
#### An analytic theory for the resolution attainable using eclipse mapping  of exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analytic theory for the resolution attainable via eclipse mapping of exoplanets, based on the Fourier components of the brightness distribution on the planetary disk. We find that the impact parameter determines which features can and cannot be seen, via the angle of the stellar edge relative to the axis of the orbit during the eclipse. We estimate the signal-to-noise ratio as a function of mapping resolution, and use this to determine the attainable resolution for a given star-planet system. We test this theory against numerical simulations and find good agreement; in particular, our predictions for the resolution as a function of stellar edge angle are accurate to the simulated data to within 10% over a wide range of angles. Our prediction for the number of spatial modes that can be constrained given a light curve error is similarly accurate. Finally, we give a list of exoplanets with the best expected resolution for observations with the NIRISS SOSS, NIRSpec G395H, and MIRI LRS instruments on JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 We report new results from quantum calculations of energy-transfer processes taking place in interstellar environments and involving two newly observed molecular species: C$_5$N$^-$ and C$_7$N$^-$ in collision with He atoms and the p-H$_2$ molecules. These species are part of the anionic molecular chains labeled as cyanopolyynes which have been observed over the years in molecule-rich Circumstellar Envelopes and in molecular clouds. In the present work, we first carry out new $ab$ $initio$ calculations for the C$_7$N$^-$ interaction potential with He atom and then obtain state-to-state rotationally inelastic cross sections and rate coefficients involving the same transitions which have been observed experimentally by emission in the interstellar medium (ISM) from both of these linear species. For the C$_5$N$^-$/He system we extend the calculations already published in our earlier work (see reference below) to compare more directly the two molecular anions. We extend further the quantum calculations by also computing in this work collision rate coefficients for the hydrogen molecule interacting with C5N$^-$, using our previously computed interaction potential. Additionally, we obtain the same rate coefficients for the C$_7$N$^-$/H$_2$ system by using a scaling procedure that makes use of the new C$_7$N$^-$/He rate coefficients, as discussed in detail in the present paper. Their significance in affecting internal state populations in ISM environments where the title anions have been found is analyzed by using the concept of critical density indicators. Finally, similarities and differences between such species and the comparative efficiency of their collision rate coefficients are discussed. These new calculations suggest that, at least for the case of these longer chains, the rotational populations could reach local thermal equilibrium conditions within their observational environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Super-Eddington accretion of neutron stars (NSs) has been suggested both observationally and theoretically. In this paper, we propose that NSs in close-orbit binary systems with companions of helium (He) stars, most of which systems form after the common-envelope phase, could experience super-Eddington stable Case BB/BC mass transfer (MT), and can sometimes occur accretion-induced collapses (AICs) to form lower mass-gap black holes (mgBHs). Our detailed binary evolution simulations reveal that AIC events tend to happen if the primaries NS have an initial mass $\gtrsim1.7\,M_\odot$ with an accretion rate of $\gtrsim300$ times the Eddington limit. These mgBHs would have a mass nearly equal to or slightly higher than the NS maximum mass. The remnant mgBH--NS binaries after the core collapses of He stars are potential progenitors of gravitational-wave (GW) source. Multimessenger observation between GW and kilonova signals from a population of high-mass binary NS and mgBH--NS mergers formed through super-Eddington stable MT are helpful in constraining the maximum mass and equation of state of NSs. S230529ay, a mgBH--NS merger candidate recently detected in the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, could possibly originate from this formation scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 We determine radial- and age-abundance gradients of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using spectra of 2,062 red giant branch (RGB) field stars observed by SDSS-IV / APOGEE-2S. With coverage out to $\sim$9 kpc in the SMC, these data taken with the high resolution ($R \sim 22,500$) APOGEE $H$-band spectrograph afford the opportunity to measure extensive radial gradients for as many as 24 abundance ratios. The SMC is found to have an overall metallicity gradient of $-$0.0546 $\pm$ 0.0043 dex/kpc. Ages are calculated for every star to explore the evolution of the different abundance gradients. As a function of age, many of the gradients show a feature 3.66--5.58 Gyr ago, which is especially prominent in the [X/H] gradients. Initially many gradients flatten until about $\sim$5.58 Gyr ago, but then steepen in more recent times. We previously detected similar evolutionary patterns in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) which are attributed to a recent interaction between the LMC and SMC. It is inferred that the feature in the SMC gradients was caused by the same interaction. The age-[X/Fe] trends, which track average [X/Fe] over time, are flat, demonstrating a slow enrichment history for the SMC. When comparing the SMC gradients to the LMC and MW, normalized to disk scale length ($R_\text{d}$), the [X/Fe] and [X/Mg] gradients are similar, but there is a dichotomy between the dwarfs and the Milky Way (MW) for the [X/H] gradients. The median MW [X/H] gradient around $-$0.125 dex/$R_\text{d}$ whilst the Clouds have gradients of about $-$0.075 dex/$R_\text{d}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the kinematics of the recently discovered Corona Australis (CrA) chain of clusters by examining the 3D space motion of its young stars using Gaia DR3 and APOGEE-2 data. While we observe linear expansion between the clusters in the Cartesian XY directions, the expansion along Z exhibits a curved pattern. To our knowledge, this is the first time such a nonlinear velocity-position relation has been observed for stellar clusters. We propose a scenario to explain our findings, in which the observed gradient is caused by stellar feedback, accelerating the gas away from the Galactic plane. A traceback analysis confirms that the CrA star formation complex was located near the central clusters of the Scorpius Centaurus (Sco-Cen) OB association 10-15 Myr ago. It contains massive stars and thus offers a natural source of feedback. Based on the velocity of the youngest unbound CrA cluster, we estimate that a median number of about two supernovae would have been sufficient to inject the present-day kinetic energy of the CrA molecular cloud. This number agrees with that of recent studies. The head-tail morphology of the CrA molecular cloud further supports the proposed feedback scenario, in which a feedback force pushed the primordial cloud from the Galactic north, leading to the current separation of 100 pc from the center of Sco-Cen. The formation of spatially and temporally well-defined star formation patterns, such as the CrA chain of clusters, is likely a common process in massive star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Supernova (SN) 2023ixf is among the most nearby Type II SNe in the last decades. As such, there is a wealth of observational data of both the event itself and of the associated object identified in pre-explosion images. This allows to perform a variety of studies that aim at determining the SN properties and the nature of the putative progenitor star. Modelling of the light curve is a powerful method to derive physical properties independently of direct progenitor analyses. Aims: To investigate the physical nature of SN 2023ixf based on hydrodynamical modelling of its bolometric light curve and expansion velocities during the complete photospheric phase. Methods: A grid of one dimensional explosions was calculated for evolved stars of different masses. We derived properties of SN 2023ixf and its progenitor by comparing our models with the observations. Results: The observations are well reproduced by the explosion of a star with zero age main sequence mass of f $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} = 12 M_\odot$ , an explosion energy of $1.2 \times 10^{51}$ erg, and a nickel production of 0.05M . This indicates that SN 2023ixf was a normal event. Our modelling suggests a limit of $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} < 15 M_\odot$ and therefore favours the low mass range among the results from pre-explosion observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The supernova remnant (SNR) G288.8-6.3 was recently discovered as a faint radio shell at large Galactic latitude using observations with ASKAP in the EMU survey. Here, we make the first detailed investigation of the $\gamma$-ray emission from the G288.8-6.3 region, aiming to characterise the high-energy emission in the GeV regime from the newly discovered SNR, dubbed Ancora. 15 years of Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) data were analysed at energies between 400 MeV and 1 TeV and the excess seen in the region was modelled using different spatial and spectral models. We detect spatially extended $\gamma$-ray emission coinciding with the radio SNR, with detection significance up to 8.8 $\sigma$. A radial disk spatial model in combination with a power-law spectral model with an energy flux of $(4.80 \pm 0.91) \times 10^{-6}$ $\text{MeV}$ $\text{cm}^{-2}$ $\text{s}^{-1}$, with the spectrum extending up to around 5 GeV was found to be the preferred model. Morphologically, hotspots seen above 1 GeV are well-correlated with the bright western part of the radio shell. The emission is more likely to be of leptonic origin given the estimated gas density in the region and the estimated distance and age of the SNR, but a hadronic scenario cannot be ruled out. Ancora is the eighth SNR detected at high Galactic latitude with Fermi-LAT. This new population of remnants has the potential to constrain the physics of particle diffusion and escape from SNRs into the Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The amount of vapor in the impact-generated protolunar disk carries implications for the dynamics, devolatilization, and moderately volatile element (MVE) isotope fractionation during lunar formation. The equation of state (EoS) used in simulations of the giant impact is required to calculate the vapor mass fraction (VMF) of the modeled protolunar disk. Recently, a new version of M-ANEOS ("Stewart M-ANEOS") was released with an improved treatment of heat capacity and expanded experimental Hugoniot. Here, we compare this new M-ANEOS version with a previous version ("N-SPH M-ANEOS") and assess the resulting differences in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. We find that Stewart M-ANEOS results in cooler disks with smaller values of VMF and results in differences in disk mass that are dependent on the initial impact angle. We also assess the implications of the minimum "cutoff" density ($\rho_{c}$), similar to a maximum smoothing length, that is set as a fast-computing alternative to an iteratively calculated smoothing length. We find that the low particle resolution of the disk typically results in $>40\%$ of disk particles falling to $\rho_c$, influencing the dynamical evolution and VMF of the disk. Our results show that choice of EoS, $\rho_{c}$, and particle resolution can cause the VMF and disk mass to vary by tens of percent. Moreover, small values of $\rho_{c}$ produce disks that are prone to numerical instability and artificial shocks. We recommend that future giant impact SPH studies review smoothing methods and ensure the thermodynamic stability of the disk over simulated time.

 - **Abstract**
 Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) is the strongest emission line in UV spectra from T-Tauri stars. Due to its resonant nature, Ly$\alpha$ emission carries information about the physical properties of the H I medium via the scattering process. This work presents spatially resolved Ly$\alpha$ emission across a protoplanetary disk in the iconic face-on T-Tauri star TW Hya, observed with HST-STIS at spatial offsets 0$''$, $\pm 0.2''$, and $\pm 0.4''$. To comprehensively interpret these Ly$\alpha$ spectra, we utilize a 3D Monte-Carlo radiative transfer simulation in a wind-disk geometry. Successfully reproducing the observed spectra requires scattering contributions from both the wind and the H I disk. We constrain the properties of the wind, the H I column density ($\sim 10^{20} \rm cm^{-2}$) and the outflow velocity ($\sim 200 \rm km s^{-1}$). To reproduce the observed spatial distribution of Ly$\alpha$, we find that the wind must cover the H I disk when viewed face-on. Furthermore, to explore the effect of Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer in T-Tauri stars, we compute the radiation field within the scattering medium and reveal that the wind reflection causes more Ly$\alpha$ photons to penetrate the disk. We also show the dependence between the disk inclination angle and the spatially resolved Ly$\alpha$ spectra. Understanding the role of Ly$\alpha$ emission in T-Tauri stars is pivotal for decoding the complex interactions between the winds, protoplanetary disks, and surrounding environments, which can significantly impact the chemistry in the protoplanetary disk. Our observation and modeling of spatially resolved Ly$\alpha$ show the necessity of spatially resolved Ly$\alpha$ observation of a broad range of targets.

 The density functional theory (DFT) is the most versatile electronic structure method used in quantum chemical calculations, and is increasingly applied in astrochemical research. This mini-review provides an overview of the applications of DFT calculations in understanding the chemistry that occurs in star-forming regions. We survey investigations into the formation of biologically-relevant compounds such as nucleobases in the interstellar medium, and also covers the formation of both achiral and chiral amino acids, as well as biologically-relevant molecules such as sugars, and nitrogen-containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Additionally, DFT calculations are used to estimate the potential barriers for chemical reactions in astronomical environments. We conclude by noting several areas that require more research, such as the formation pathways of chiral amino acids, complex sugars and other biologically-important molecules, and the role of environmental factors in the formation of interstellar biomolecules.

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate the physical nature of neutrino-heating on the result of a 1-dimensional core-collapse supernova. Colgate were the first to suggest that neutrinos may play a crucial role in core collapse supernova by taking up gravitational binding energy from the core and depositing it in the rest of the star. The fluid is contained in a shock tube in a region extending from the neutrino-sphere of a star out 1000 km, and irradiated with a neutrino flux emanating from the surface of the neutrino-sphere into the shock tube. Interaction due to electron-neutrino scattering off of fluid nucleons is used to account for neutrino heating of the fluid. The numerical method used is the Godunov method implementing an exact Riemann solver Rezzolla when needed. The simulated core-collapse produces an energy output of up to $10^{36}$J on a timescale of 3.33 s. It was found that the Godunov method performs very well using Sod data, with standard deviations of between $0.22-0.04$%. Thus, there is high confidence that the exact Riemann solver is working correctly and that the Godunov method is also reproducing the exact solutions to the Sod data with high confidence. A runtime of 3.33 s was used. The objective was to determine what would happen to the shock system over longer timescales, but the simulations showed an explosion in a much shorter time frame. It was found that the shock not only continues to move outward, but is also driven by large energy and pressure behind the shock. The density profiles show that fluid mass is pushed outward, but the fluid velocity actually reversed on timescales close to 3.33 s. In this paper, net mass movement occurs at 500-600 km and on a longer timescale of 3.33 s mass has moved out to 700 km. This supports the \emph{delayed post bounce shock mechanism}.

 At the far reaches of the outer Solar System, the ice giants remain the last class of planets yet to be studied using orbiters. The 2023-2032 Planetary Science Decadal Survey has underscored the importance of the ice giants in understanding the origin, formation, and evolution of our Solar System. The enormous heliocentric distance of Uranus presents considerable mission design challenges, the most important being able to reach Uranus within a reasonable time. The present study presents two examples of aerocapture enabled short flight time, fast trajectories for Uranus orbiter missions, and highlights the enormous benefits provided by aerocapture. The first is an EEJU trajectory with a launch opportunity in July 2031 with a flight time of 8 years. The second is an EJU trajectory with a launch opportunity in June 2034 with a flight time of only 5 years. Using the Falcon Heavy Expendable, the available launch capability is 4950 kg and 1400 kg respectively for the two trajectories. Both trajectories have a high arrival speed of 20 km/s, which provides sufficient corridor width for aerocapture. Compared to propulsive insertion architectures which take 13 to 15 years, the fast trajectories offer significant reduction in the flight time.

 In this study we compute the equation of state and Rosseland mean opacity from temperatures of T~30000 K down to T~400 K, pushing the capabilities of the AESOPUS code (Marigo et al., 2022; Marigo & Aringer, 2009) into the regime where solid grains can form. The GGchem code (Woitke et al. 2018) is used to solve the chemistry for temperatures less than ~3000 K. Atoms, molecules, and dust grains in thermodynamic equilibrium are all included in the equation of state. To incorporate monochromatic atomic and molecular cross sections, an optimized opacity sampling technique is used. The Mie theory is employed to calculate the opacity of 43 grain species. Tables of Rosseland mean opacities for scaled-solar compositions are provided. Based on our computing resources, opacities for other chemical patterns, as well as various grain sizes, porosity, and shapes, can be easily computed upon user request to the corresponding author.
#### A comparative study on three modes of s-process nucleosynthesis in  extremely metal-poor AGB stars

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in the Galactic halo have a wide range of neutron-capture element abundance patterns. To identify their origin, we investigated three modes of $s$-process nucleosynthesis that have been proposed to operate in extremely metal-poor (EMP) Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars: the convective 13C burning, which occurs when hydrogen is engulfed by the helium flash convection in low-mass AGB stars, the convective 22Ne burning, which occurs in the helium flash convection of intermediate-mass AGB stars, and the radiative 13C burning, which occurs in the $^{13}$C pocket that is formed during the inter-pulse periods. We show that the production of $s$-process elements per iron seed ($s$-process efficiency) does not depend on metallicity below $[{\rm Fe}/{\rm H}]=-2$, because 16O in the helium zone dominates the neutron poison. The convective 13C mode can produce a variety of $s$-process efficiencies for Sr, Ba and Pb, including the maxima observed among CEMP stars. The 22Ne mode only produce the lowest end of $s$-process efficiencies among CEMP models. We show that the combination of these two modes can explain the full range of observed enrichment of $s$-process elements in CEMP stars. In contrast, the 13C pocket mode can hardly explain the high level of enrichment observed in some CEMP stars, even if considering star-to-star variations of the mass of the 13C pocket. These results provide a basis for discussing the binary mass transfer origin of CEMP stars and their subgroups.

 - **Abstract**
 We present ALMA observations of the Class I source Oph IRS63 in the context of the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) large program. Our ALMA observations of Oph IRS63 show a myriad of protostellar features, such as a shell-like bipolar outflow (in $^{12}$CO), an extended rotating envelope structure (in $^{13}$CO), a streamer connecting the envelope to the disk (in C$^{18}$O), and several small-scale spiral structures seen towards the edge of the dust continuum (in SO). By analyzing the velocity pattern of $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O, we measure a protostellar mass of $\rm M_\star = 0.5 \pm 0.2 $~$\rm M_\odot$ and confirm the presence of a disk rotating at almost Keplerian velocity that extends up to $\sim260$ au. These calculations also show that the gaseous disk is about four times larger than the dust disk, which could indicate dust evolution and radial drift. Furthermore, we model the C$^{18}$O streamer and SO spiral structures as features originating from an infalling rotating structure that continuously feeds the young protostellar disk. We compute an envelope-to-disk mass infall rate of $\sim 10^{-6}$~$\rm M_\odot \, yr^{-1}$ and compare it to the disk-to-star mass accretion rate of $\sim 10^{-8}$~$\rm M_\odot \, yr^{-1}$, from which we infer that the protostellar disk is in a mass build-up phase. At the current mass infall rate, we speculate that soon the disk will become too massive to be gravitationally stable.

 - **Abstract**
 Minkowski functionals are summary statistics that capture the geometric and morphological properties of fields. They are sensitive to all higher order correlations of the fields and can be used to complement more conventional statistics, such as the power spectrum of the field. We develop a Minkowski functional-based approach for a full likelihood analysis of mildly non-Gaussian sky maps with partial sky coverage. Applying this to the inference of cosmological parameters from the Planck mission's map of the Cosmic Microwave Background's lensing convergence, we find an excellent agreement with results from the power spectrum-based lensing likelihood. While the non-Gaussianity of current CMB lensing maps is dominated by reconstruction noise, a Minkowski functional-based analysis may be able to extract cosmological information from the non-Gaussianity of future lensing maps and thus go beyond what is accessible with a power spectrum-based analysis. We make the numerical code for the calculation of a map's Minkowski functionals, skewness and kurtosis parameters available for download from GitHub.

 The CLEAR Space Weather Center of Excellence (CLEAR center) is a five year project that is funded by the NASA Space Weather Center of Excellence program. The CLEAR center will build a comprehensive prediction framework for solar energetic particles (SEPs) focusing on the timely and accurate prediction of low radiation periods (``all clear forecast") and the occurrence and characteristics of elevated periods. This will be accomplished by integrating empirical, first-principles based and machine learning (ML)-trained prediction models. In this paper, the motivation, overview, and tools of the CLEAR center will be discussed.

 Context. We report the exploitation of a sample of epoch astrometry for 157 000 asteroids, the same object in the Gaia Data Release 3, extended over the time coverage planned for the Gaia DR4, which is not expected before the end of 2025. This data set covers more than one full orbital period for the vast majority of these asteroids. The orbital solutions are derived from the Gaia data alone over a relatively short arc compared to the observation history of many of these asteroids. Aims. The work aims to produce orbital elements for a large set of asteroids based on 66 months of accurate astrometry provided by Gaia and to assess the accuracy of these orbital solutions with a comparison to the best available orbits derived from independent observations. A second validation is performed with accurate occultation timings. Methods. We processed the raw astrometric measurements of Gaia to obtain astrometric positions of moving objects with 1D sub-mas accuracy at the bright end. For each asteroid that we matched to the data, an orbit fitting was attempted in the form of the best fit of the initial conditions at the median epoch. Results. Orbits are provided in the form of state vectors in the International Celestial Reference Frame for 156 764 asteroids, including near-Earth objects, main-belt asteroids, and Trojans. For the asteroids with the best observations, the (formal) relative uncertainty is better than 1E10. Results are compared to orbits available from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and MPC. Their orbits are based on much longer data arcs, but from positions of lower quality. The relative differences in semi-major axes have a mean of 5E10 and a scatter of 5E9.

 - **Abstract**
 Light from celestial objects interacts with the molecules of the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in the production of telluric absorption lines in ground-based spectral data. Correcting for these lines, which strongly affect red and infrared wavelengths, is often needed in a wide variety of scientific applications. Here, we present the template division telluric modeling (TDTM) technique, a method for accurately removing telluric absorption lines in stars that exhibit numerous intrinsic features. Based on the Earth's barycentric motion throughout the year, our approach is suited for disentangling telluric and stellar spectral components. By fitting a synthetic transmission model, telluric-free spectra are derived. We demonstrate the performance of the TDTM technique in correcting telluric contamination using a high-resolution optical spectral time series of the feature-rich M3.0 dwarf star Wolf 294 that was obtained with the CARMENES spectrograph. We apply the TDTM approach to the CARMENES survey sample, which consists of 382 targets encompassing 22357 optical and 20314 near-infrared spectra, to correct for telluric absorption. The corrected spectra are coadded to construct template spectra for each of our targets. This library of telluric-free, high signal-to-noise ratio, high-resolution (R>80000) templates comprises the most comprehensive collection of spectral M-dwarf data available to date, both in terms of quantity and quality, and is available at the project website (this http URL).

 The determination of the spatial geometry of the universe plays an important role in modern cosmology. Any deviation from the cosmic curvature $\Omega_K=0$ would have a profound impact on the primordial inflation paradigm and fundamental physics. In this paper, we carry out a systematic study of the prospect of measuring cosmic curvature with the inspiral signal of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) that could be detected with TianQin. The study is based on a cosmological-model-independent method that extended the application of gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens in cosmology. By comparing the distances from future simulated GW events and simulated $H(z)$ data, we evaluate if TianQin would produce robust constraints on the cosmic curvature parameter $\Omega_{k}$. More specifically, we consider 3-yr to 10-yr observations of supermassive black hole binaries with total masses ranging from $10^{3}M_\odot$ to $10^{7}M_\odot$. Our results show that in the future, with the synergy of 10-yr high-quality observations, we can tightly constrain the curvature parameter at the level of $1\sigma$ $\Omega_k=-0.002\pm0.061$. Moreover, our findings indicate that the total mass of SMBHB does influence the estimation of cosmic curvature, implied by the analysis performed on different subsamples of gravitational wave data. Therefore, TianQin is expected to provide a powerful and competitive probe of the spatial geometry of the universe, compared to future spaced-based detectors such as DECIGO.

 - **Abstract**
 Black widows (BWs) are a type of eclipsing millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with low companion masses ($\lesssim0.05\,\rm M_\odot$) and tight orbits ($<1\,$d). PSR J1953+1844 is a BW with the shortest orbital period ($\sim53$ minutes) ever discovered, which was recently detected by Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. Its companion mass is $\sim0.01\,\rm M_\odot$ according to its mass function, indicating that the companion may be a hydrogen-deficient star. However, the origin of PSR J1953+1844 is highly unclear. In this paper, we explored the origin of PSR J1953+1844 through the neutron star+He star channel, in which the system can experience ultracompact X-ray binary phase. We found that the He star donor channel can reproduce the characteristics of PSR J1953+1844, indicating that this work provides an alternative formation channel for this source. Meanwhile, the minimum orbital period of BWs formed by this channel is $\sim28$ minutes, corresponding to the companion mass of $0.058\,\rm M_\odot$. In addition, we note that even though PSR J1953+1844 has a short orbital period, it cannot be detected by the gravitational wave (GW) observatories like Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, TaiJi and TianQin. However, we still expect that the BWs with extremely tight orbit produced by this channel are the potential sources of future space-based GW observatories. Moreover, our simulations show that PSR J1953+1844 may eventually evolve into an isolated MSP.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the Resident Space Objects (RSOs) is nowadays a major societal challenge; indeed, the number of resident objects increases with an incredible steady pace, because of the fragmentation of uncontrolled orbiting objects and new launches. There is thus the need for a better understanding of the system as a whole to be able to determine and shape sustainable and ecological policies. This paper presents a new paradigm for analysing the structural properties of RSOs collisions from the complex systems perspective. Based on neighbouring relationships, we introduce the Resident Space Object Network (RSONet) by connecting RSOs that experience near-collisions events over a finite-time window. The structural collisional properties of RSOs are thus encoded into the RSONet and analysed with the tools of network science. This framework and paradigm shift allow us to use quantitative characteristics related to the RSONet to introduce indices for space sustainability criteria.

 Pulsations in RR Lyrae stars and classical Cepheids were thought to be relatively simple since they typically pulsate only in one or two radial modes. This picture changes at a closer look when modulation or additional low-amplitude signals are detected. I will review different multi-periodic groups known among classical pulsators, including stars showing the Blazhko modulation.

 - **Abstract**
 The reactivity of interstellar carbon atoms (C) on the water-dominated ices is one of the possible ways to form interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs). In this work, we report a quantum chemical study of the coupling reaction of C ($^3$P) with an icy water molecule, alongside possible subsequent reactions with the most abundant closed shell frozen species (NH$_3$, CO, CO$_2$ and H$_2$), atoms (H, N and O), and molecular radicals (OH, NH$_2$ and CH$_3$). We found that C spontaneously reacts with the water molecule, resulting in the formation of $^3$C-OH$_2$, a highly reactive species due to its triplet electronic state. While reactions with the closed-shell species do not show any reactivity, reactions with N and O form CN and CO, respectively, the latter ending up into methanol upon subsequent hydrogenation. The reactions with OH, CH$_3$ and NH$_2$ form methanediol, ethanol and methanimine, respectively, upon subsequent hydrogenation. We also propose an explanation for methane formation, observed in experiments through H additions to C in the presence of ices. The astrochemical implications of this work are: i) atomic C on water ice is locked into $^3$C-OH$_2$, making difficult the reactivity of bare C atoms on the icy surfaces, contrary to what is assumed in astrochemical current models; and ii) the extraordinary reactivity of $^3$C-OH$_2$ provides new routes towards the formation of iCOMs in a non-energetic way, in particular ethanol, mother of other iCOMs once in the gas-phase.

 - **Abstract**
 Among Type Ia supernova remnants (SNRs), Tycho's SNR has been considered as a typical object from the viewpoints of its spectroscopic, morphological and environmental properties. A recent reanalysis of Chandra data shows that its forward shock is experiencing a substantial deceleration since around 2007, which suggests recent shock interactions with a dense medium as a consequence of the cavity-wall environment inside a molecular cloud. Such a non-uniform environment can be linked back to the nature and activities of its progenitor. In this study, we perform hydrodynamic simulations to characterize Tycho's cavity-wall environment using the latest multi-epoch proper motion measurements of the forward shock. A range of parameters for the environment is explored in the hydrodynamic models to fit with the observation data for each azimuthal region. Our results show that a wind-like cavity with $\rho(r)\propto r^{-2}$ reconciles with the latest data better than a uniform medium with a constant density. In addition, our best-fit model favors an anisotropic wind with an azimuthally varying wind parameter. The overall result indicates a mass-loss rate which is unusually high for the conventional single-degenerate explosion scenario.
#### Simulating the tidal disruption of stars by stellar-mass black holes  using moving-mesh hydrodynamics

 - **Abstract**
 In the centers of dense star clusters, close encounters between stars and compact objects are likely to occur. We study tidal disruption events of main-sequence (MS) stars by stellar-mass black holes (termed $\mu$TDEs), which can shed light on the processes occurring in these clusters, including being an avenue in the mass growth of stellar-mass BHs. Using the moving-mesh hydrodynamics code \texttt{AREPO}, we perform a suite of hydrodynamics simulations of partial $\mu$TDEs of realistic, \texttt{MESA}-generated MS stars by varying the initial mass of the star ($0.5\,{\rm M}_{\rm \odot}$ and $1\,{\rm M}_{\rm \odot}$), the age of the star (zero-age, middle-age and terminal-age), the mass of the black hole ($10\,{\rm M}_{\rm \odot}$ and $40\,{\rm M}_{\rm \odot}$) and the impact parameter (yielding almost no mass loss to full disruption). We then examine the dependence of the masses, spins, and orbital parameters of the partially disrupted remnant on the initial encounter parameters. We find that the mass lost from a star decreases exponentially with increasing distance of approach and that a $1\,{\rm M}_{\rm \odot}$ star loses lesser mass than a $0.5\,{\rm M}_{\rm \odot}$. Moreover, a more evolved star is less susceptible to mass loss. Tidal torques at the closest approach spin up the remnant by factors of $10^2$--$10^4$ depending on the impact parameter. The remnant star can be bound (eccentric) or unbound (hyperbolic) to the black hole: hyperbolic orbits occur when the star's central density concentration is relatively low and the black hole-star mass ratio is high, which is the case for the disruption of a $0.5\,{\rm M}_{\rm \odot}$ star. Finally, we provide best-fit analytical formulae for a range of parameters that can be incorporated into cluster codes to model star-black hole interaction more accurately.

 - **Abstract**
 We report evidence of dust formation in the cold, dense shell behind the ejecta-circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction in the Type Ia (SNIa) SN2018evt three years after the explosion, characterized by a rise in the mid-infrared (MIR) flux accompanied by an accelerated decline in the optical. Such a dust-formation picture is also corroborated by the concurrent evolution of the profiles of the Ha emission lines. Our models suggest enhanced dust concentration at increasing distances from the SN as compared to what can be expected from the density profile of the mass loss from a steady stellar wind. This may indicate an enhanced dust presence at larger distances from the progenitor star. The dust distribution can be modeled in terms of a double-shell which assumes a sudden change of the density profile of the dust or a single-shell model with a flatter radial profile. The inferred mass-loss history of SN2018evt is consistent with a progenitor's mass loss in a binary system containing a C/O white dwarf and a massive asymptotic giant branch star. The grand rebrightening in the MIR after day +310 is attributed to the formation of new dust within the CDS region behind the forward shock. The mass of the newly-formed dust increases rapidly with time and follows a power law with an index of 4. By the time of the last MIR observations at day +1041, a total amount of 1.2+-0.2 x 10^{-2} Msun of dust has been produced, making SN 2018evt one of the most prolific dust factory among SNe with evidence of dust formations.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, tremendous progress has been made on scientific Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (sCMOS) sensors, making them a promising device for future space X-ray missions. We have customized a large-format sCMOS sensor, G1516BI, dedicated for X-ray applications. In this work, a 200-nm-thick aluminum layer is successfully sputtered on the surface of this sensor. This Al-coated sensor, named EP4K, shows consistent performance with the uncoated version. The readout noise of the EP4K sensor is around 2.5 e- and the dark current is less than 0.01 e-/pixel/s at -30 degree. The maximum frame rate is 20 Hz in the current design. The ratio of single pixel events of the sensor is 45.0%. The energy resolution can reach 153.2 eV at 4.51 keV and 174.2 eV at 5.90 keV at -30 degree. The optical transmittance of the aluminum layer is approximately 1e-8 to 1e-10 for optical lights from 365 to 880 nm, corresponding to an effective aluminum thickness of around 140 to 160 nm. The good X-ray performance and low optical transmittance of this Al-coated sCMOS sensor make it a good choice for space X-ray missions. The Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy (LEIA), which has been working in orbit for about one year, is equipped with four pieces of EP4K sensors. Furthermore, 48 pieces of EP4K sensors are used on the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) on the Einstein Probe (EP) satellite, which will be launched at the end of 2023.

 - **Abstract**
 Higher-order spatial laser modes have recently been investigated as candidates for reducing test-mass thermal noise in ground-based gravitational-wave detectors such as advanced LIGO. In particular, higher-order Hermite-Gauss (HG) modes have gained attention within the community for their more robust behaviors against random test-mass surface deformations and stronger sensing and control capacities. In this letter we offer experimental investigations on various aspects of HG mode interferometry. We have generated purified HG modes up to the 12-th order $\mathrm{HG}_{6,6}$ mode, with a power conversion efficiency of 38.8% and 27.7% for the $\mathrm{HG}_{3,3}$ and $\mathrm{HG}_{6,6}$ modes respectively. We demonstrated for the first time the misalignment and mode mismatch-induced power coupling loss measurements for HG modes up to the $\mathrm{HG}_{6,6}$. We report an excellent agreement with the extended numerical power loss factors that in the ``small power loss'' region converge to $2n+1$ or $n^2+n+1$ for a misaligned or mode mismatched $\mathrm{HG}_{n,n}$ mode. We also demonstrated the wavefront sensing (WFS) signal measurement for HG modes up to the $\mathrm{HG}_{6,6}$. The measurement result is accurately in accordance with theoretical WFS gain $\beta_{n,n-1}\sqrt{n} + \beta_{n,n+1}\sqrt{n+1}$ for an $\mathrm{HG}_{n,n}$ mode, with $\beta_{n,n-1}$ being the beat coefficient of the adjacent $\mathrm{HG}_{n,n}$ and $\mathrm{HG}_{n-1,n}$ modes on a split photodetector.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the precise radial velocity follow-up of TOI-544 (HD 290498), a bright K star (V=10.8), which hosts a small transiting planet recently discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We collected 122 high-resolution HARPS and HARPS-N spectra to spectroscopically confirm the transiting planet and measure its mass. The nearly 3-year baseline of our follow-up allowed us to unveil the presence of an additional, non-transiting, longer-period companion planet. We derived a radius and mass for the inner planet, TOI-544b, of 2.018 $\pm$ 0.076 R$_{\oplus}$ and 2.89 $\pm$ 0.48 M$_{\oplus}$ respectively, which gives a bulk density of $1.93^{+0.30}_{-0.25}$ g cm$^{-3}$. TOI-544c has a minimum mass of 21.5 $\pm$ 2.0 M$_{\oplus}$ and orbital period of 50.1 $\pm$ 0.2 days. The low density of planet-b implies that it has either an Earth-like rocky core with a hydrogen atmosphere, or a composition which harbours a significant fraction of water. The composition interpretation is degenerate depending on the specific choice of planet interior models used. Additionally, TOI-544b has an orbital period of 1.55 days and equilibrium temperature of 999 $\pm$ 14 K, placing it within the predicted location of the radius valley, where few planets are expected. TOI-544b is a top target for future atmospheric observations, for example with JWST, which would enable better constraints of the planet composition.

 - **Abstract**
 The conventional observables to identify a habitable or inhabited environment in exoplanets, such as an ocean glint or abundant atmospheric O$_2$, will be challenging to detect with present or upcoming observatories. Here we suggest a new signature. A low carbon abundance in the atmosphere of a temperate rocky planet, relative to other planets of the same system, traces the presence of substantial amount of liquid water, plate tectonic and/or biomass. We show that JWST can already perform such a search in some selected systems like TRAPPIST-1 via the CO$_2$ band at $4.3\,\rm \mu m$, which falls in a spectral sweet spot where the overall noise budget and the effect of cloud/hazes are optimal. We propose a 3-step strategy for transiting exoplanets: 1) detection of an atmosphere around temperate terrestrial planets in $\sim 10$ transits for the most favorable systems, (2) assessment of atmospheric carbon depletion in $\sim 40$ transits, (3) measurements of O$_3$ abundance to disentangle between a water- vs biomass-supported carbon depletion in $\sim100$ transits. The concept of carbon depletion as a signature for habitability is also applicable for next-generation direct imaging telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 The pointing pattern is an integral part of designing one's observation strategy for a certain scientific goal. But accounting for the particular science case or instrument artifacts (like distortion, vignetting or large areas of bad pixels) can make it hard to predict how the exposure map of the final stack will be. To help address this problem, Gnuastro 0.21 includes a new executable program called astscript-pointing-simulate that is fully described in the Gnuastro manual and comes with a complete tutorial. The figures of this research note are reproducible with Maneage, on the Git commit 4176d29.

 - **Abstract**
 We report observations with the JWST/NIRCam coronagraph of the Fomalhaut system. This nearby A star hosts a complex debris disk system discovered by the IRAS satellite. Observations in F444W and F356W filters using the round 430R mask achieve a contrast ratio of ~ 4 x 10-7 at 1'' and ~ 4 x 10-8 outside of 3''. These observations reach a sensitivity limit <1 MJup across most of the disk region. Consistent with the hypothesis that Fomalhaut b is not a massive planet but is a dust cloud from a planetesimal collision, we do not detect it in either F356W or F444W (the latter band where a Jovian-sized planet should be bright). We have reliably detected 10 sources in and around Fomalhaut and its debris disk, all but one of which are coincident with Keck or HST sources seen in earlier coronagraphic imaging; we show them to be background objects, including the "Great Dust Cloud" identified in MIRI data. However, one of the objects, located at the edge of the inner dust disk seen in the MIRI images, has no obvious counterpart in imaging at earlier epochs and has a relatively red [F356W]-[F444W]>0.7 mag (Vega) color. Whether this object is a background galaxy, brown dwarf, or a Jovian mass planet in the Fomalhaut system will be determined by an approved Cycle 2 follow-up program. Finally, we set upper limits to any scattered light from the outer ring, placing a weak limit on the dust albedo at F356W and F444W.

 - **Abstract**
 Terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around nearby stars are of great interest and provide a good sample for further characteristics of their habitability. In this paper, we collect a nearby star catalog within 20 pc according to the Gaia Catalog of Nearby Stars, complete the physical parameters of the stars, and select stars that are not brown dwarfs or white dwarfs. After selection, a sample of 2234 main-sequence stars is used to estimate the extended HZ. Then we inject Earth-like planets into the extended HZ around each star and calculate the signals with four methods, i.e.; velocity amplitude for radial velocity, transit probability and depth for transit, stellar displacements for astrometry, and contrast and angular separation for imaging. Considering a typical noise model based on classic instruments, we predict the highest possible detection number of Earth-like planets via different methods in the best-case hypothetical scenario. According to this, we conclude that both astrometry and imaging have the potential to detect nearby Earth-like planets around G type stars, while radial velocity has the potential to detect 2% of nearby Earth-like planets around M stars under a precision of 0.2 m/s. Our work also provides the precision requirements for future missions to reveal the nearby Earth-like planet in the HZ.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the characterisation of the two transiting planets around HD 152843 (TOI 2319, TIC 349488688) using an intensive campaign of HARPS-N radial velocities, and two sectors of TESS data. These data reveal a unique and fascinating system: HD 152843 b and c have near equal masses of around 9 M$_\oplus$ but differing radii of $3.05 \pm 0.11$ R$_\oplus$ and $5.94^{+0.18}_{-0.16}$ R$_\oplus$ , respectively, and orbital periods of $11.62071^{+9.6e-05}_{-0.000106}$ days and $19.502104^{+7.4e-05}_{-8.5e-05}$ days. This indicates that HD 152843 c is in the lowest fifth percentile in density of the known exoplanet population, and has the longest orbital period among these low density planets. Further, HD 152843 c's radius places it in the Saturn valley, the observed lack of planets larger than Neptune, but smaller than Saturn. The orbital periods of these planets indicate they are near a 5:3 mean motion resonance, indicating the possibility of transit timing variations, and hints at the possibility of interaction with a third planet at some point in the evolution of this system. Further, the brightness of the host star and the low density of HD 152843 c make it a key target for atmospheric characterisation.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar chemical abundances have proved themselves a key source of information for understanding the evolution of the Milky Way, and the scale of major stellar surveys such as GALAH have massively increased the amount of chemical data available. However, progress is hampered by the level of precision in chemical abundance data as well as the visualization methods for comparing the multidimensional outputs of chemical evolution models to stellar abundance data. Machine learning methods have greatly improved the former; while the application of tree-building or phylogenetic methods borrowed from biology are beginning to show promise with the latter. Here we analyse a sample of GALAH solar twins to address these issues. We apply The Cannon algorithm (Ness et al. (2015)) to generate a catalogue of about 40,000 solar twins with 14 high precision abundances which we use to perform a phylogenetic analysis on a selection of stars that have two different ranges of eccentricities. From our analyses we are able to find a group with mostly stars on circular orbits and some old stars with eccentric orbits whose age-[Y/Mg] relation agrees remarkably well with the chemical clocks published by previous high precision abundance studies. Our results show the power of combining survey data with machine learning and phylogenetics to reconstruct the history of the Milky Way.

 We report the discovery of two TESS sub-Neptunes orbiting the early M dwarf TOI-904 (TIC 261257684). Both exoplanets, TOI-904 b and c, were initially observed in TESS sector 12 with twin sizes of 2.49R$_\oplus$ and 2.31R$_\oplus$, respectively. Through observations in five additional sectors in the TESS primary mission and the first and second extended missions, the orbital periods of both planets were measured to be 10.887$\pm$0.001 and 83.999$\pm$0.001 days, respectively. Reconnaissance radial velocity measurements (taken with EULER/CORALIE) and high resolution speckle imaging with adaptive optics (obtained from SOAR/HRCAM and Gemini South/ZORRO) show no evidence of an eclipsing binary or a nearby companion, which together with the low false positive probabilities calculated with the statistical validation software TRICERATOPS establish the planetary nature of these candidates. The outer planet, TOI-904 c, is the longest-period M dwarf exoplanet found by TESS, with an estimated equilibrium temperature of 217K. As the three other validated planets with comparable host stars and orbital periods were observed by Kepler around much dimmer stars (J$_{mag}$ $>$ 12), TOI-904 c, orbiting a brighter star (J$_{mag}$ $=$ 9.6), is the coldest M dwarf planet easily accessible for atmospheric follow-up. Future mass measurements and transmission spectroscopy of the similar sized planets in this system could determine whether they are also similar in density and composition, suggesting a common formation pathway, or whether they have distinct origins.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Herschel PACS spectroscopy of the [O III] 88.4um fine-structure line in the nearby WC8+O binary system gamma Vel to determine its oxygen abundance. The critical density of this line corresponds to several 10^5 R* such that it is spatially extended in PACS observations at the 336 pc distance to gamma Vel. Two approaches are used, the first involving a detailed stellar atmosphere analysis of gamma Vel using CMFGEN, extending to Ne ~ 10^0 cm^-3 in order to fully sample the line formation region of [O III] 88.4um. The second approach involves the analytical model introduced by Barlow et al. and revised by Dessart et al, additionally exploiting ISO LWS spectroscopy of [O III] 51.8um. We obtain higher luminosities for the WR and O components of gamma Vel with respect to De Marco et al, log L/L_sun = 5.31 and 5.56, respectively, primarily as a result of the revised (higher) interferometric distance. We obtain an oxygen mass fraction of X_O = 1.0+/- 0.3% for an outer wind volume filling factor of f = 0.5+/-0.25, favouring either standard or slightly reduced Kunz et al. rates for the ^12C(alpha, gamma)^16O reaction from comparison with BPASS binary population synthesis models. We also revisit sulphur and neon abundances in the outer wind of gamma Vel from ISO SWS spectroscopy of [S IV] 10.5um and [Ne III] 15.5um. The sulphur abundance of X_S = 0.04 +/- 0.01% agrees with the solar abundance, as expected for unprocessed elements, with the inferred neon abundance X_Ne = 1.5-0.5+0.3%, in good agreement with BPASS predictions.
