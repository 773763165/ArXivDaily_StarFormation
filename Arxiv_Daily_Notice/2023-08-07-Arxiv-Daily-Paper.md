#### Identifying parent bodies of meteorites among near-Earth asteroids

 - **Abstract**
 Meteorites provide an important source of information about the formation and composition of asteroids, because the level of accuracy of studies and analyses performed in a laboratory cannot be achieved by any ground or space based observation. To better understand what asteroid types a meteorite represents, it is crucial to identify the body they originated from. In this paper, we aim to determine possible parent bodies for the known meteorite falls among the known population of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). By using the similarity criterion $D_N$, based on geocentric quantities, we found 20 possible NEA-meteorite pairs. By performing additional numerical simulations of the backward dynamics, we found that 12 of these pairs may be associated with a possible separation event from the progenitor NEA, while the remaining 8 pairs appear to be ambiguous or random associations. The most interesting are the Pribram and Neuschwanstein meteorites, which are dynamically associated with (482488) 2012 SW20 with a common separation age dating back to about 20$-$30 kyr ago, and the Motopi Pan meteorite, that has three candidate parent bodies: (454100) 2013 BO73, 2017 MC3, and 2009 FZ4. The average time of separation between our meteorite list and the progenitor body appears to be about 10 kyr, a time consistent with what is expected from the collision frequency of small NEAs. Based on our results, we suggest that about 25 per cent of meteorites do not originate in the main belt, but mainly from little collision events happening between NEAs in the inner Solar System.
#### Disrupted dwarf binary merger as the possible origin of NGC 2419 and  Sagittarius stream substructure

 - **Abstract**
 Using $N$-body simulations, we demonstrate that satellite dwarf galaxy pairs which undergo significant mixing ($\sim 6$ Gyr) can have their respective most bound particles separated great distances upon subsequently merging with a more massive host. This may provide an explanation as to the origin of the complex globular cluster NGC 2149, which is found within the tail of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy, yet separated from its central remnant by over 100 kpc. Dynamical investigations could support the chemical evidence which already points to the NGC 2419 being a nuclear star cluster. Motivated by the distinct nature of NGC 2419, we run a suite of simulations whereby an initial pre-infall merger of two satellites is followed by a post-infall merger of the remnant into a MW-like host potential. We present a striking example from our suite in this work, in which this separation is reproduced by the most bound particles of the two pre-infall satellites. Additionally, this double merger scenario can induce unusual on-sky features in the tidal debris of the post-infall merger, such as clouds, overdensities, and potentially new arms that could resemble the bifurcation observed in Sagittarius.
#### A relativistic outflow model of the X-ray polarization in Cyg X-1

 - **Abstract**
 We propose that the polarization of the emission from the X-ray binary Cygnus X-1, measured using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), is imprinted by bulk Comptonization of coronal emission in a mildly relativistic wind or jet with a hollow-cone geometry. Models based on scattering in a static corona overlying a thin accretion disc have difficulty reproducing the relatively high polarization degree (PD ~4%) concurrently with the low inclination (~30 deg) of the binary orbit. We show that bulk outflow with a Lorentz factor > 1.5 is adequate to reproduce the observed PD, with position angle parallel to the large-scale jet, provided that the scattering occurs in a conical sheath offset from the jet axis and our line of sight aligns roughly with the opening angle of the cone. Physically, this flow geometry could represent the entrainment of dense material near the base of an accelerating jet as it passes through the disc corona, or a slow (but still relativistic) sheath around a fast jet. If similar outflows are present in other X-ray binaries at higher inclination, we might expect to see still higher degrees of linear polarization ~10% with an orientation perpendicular to the jet direction.

 - **Abstract**
 The Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) AT 2018hyz exhibited a delayed radio flare almost three years after the stellar disruption. Here we report new radio observations of the TDE AT 2018hyz with the AMI-LA and ATCA spanning from a month to more than four years after the optical discovery and 200 days since the last reported radio observation. We detected no radio detection from 30-220 days after the optical discovery in our observations at 15.5 GHz down to a $3\sigma$ level of < 0.14 mJy. The fast-rising, delayed, radio flare is observed in our radio data set and continues to rise almost ~1580 days after the optical discovery. We find that the delayed radio emission, first detected $972$ days after optical discovery, evolves as $t^{4.2 \pm 0.9}$, at 15.5 GHz. Here, we present an off-axis jet model that can explain the full set of radio observations. In the context of this model, we require a powerful narrow jet with an isotropic equivalent kinetic energy $E_{\rm k,iso} \sim 10^{55}$ erg, an opening angle of $ \rm \sim 7^{\circ}$, and a relatively large viewing angle of $ \rm \sim 42^{\circ}$, launched at the time of the stellar disruption. Within our framework, we find that the minimal collimated energy possible for an off-axis jet from AT 2018hyz is $E_k \geq 3 \times 10^{52}$ erg. Finally, we provide predictions based on our model for the light curve turnover time, and for the proper motion of the radio emitting source.
#### Gravitational torque in circumbinary discs: global radial oscillations

 - **Abstract**
 Circumbinary discs (CBDs) arise in many astrophysical settings, including young stellar binaries and supermassive black hole binaries. Their structure is mediated by gravitational torques exerted on the disc by the central binary. The spatial distribution of the binary torque density (so-called excitation torque density) in CBDs is known to feature global large-amplitude, quasi-periodic oscillations, which are often interpreted in terms of the local resonant Lindblad torques. Here we investigate the nature of these torque oscillations using 2D, inviscid hydrodynamic simulations and theoretical calculations. We show that torque oscillations arise due to the gravitational coupling of the binary potential to the density waves launched near the inner cavity and freely propagating out in the disc. We provide analytical predictions for the radial periodicity of the torque density oscillations and verify them with simulations, showing that disc sound speed and the multiplicity of the density wave spiral arms are the key factors setting the radial structure of the oscillations. Resonant Lindblad torques play no direct role in determining the radial structure and periodicity of the torque oscillations and manifest themselves only by driving the density waves in the disc. We also find that vortices forming at the inner edge of the disc can provide a non-trivial contribution to the angular momentum transport in the CBD. Our results can be applied to understanding torque behaviour in other settings, e.g. discs in cataclysmic variables and X-ray binaries.
#### Gravitational instability, spiral substructure, and modest grain growth  in a typical protostellar disk: Modeling multi-wavelength dust continuum  observation of TMC1A

 - **Abstract**
 Embedded, Class 0/I protostellar disks represent the initial condition for planet formation. This calls for better understandings of their bulk properties and the dust grains within them. We model multi-wavelength dust continuum observations of the disk surrounding the Class I protostar TMC1A to provide insight on these properties. The observations can be well fit by a gravitationally self-regulated (i.e., marginally gravitationally unstable and internally heated) disk model, with surface density $\Sigma \sim 1720 (R/10au)^{-1.96} g/cm^2$ and midplane temperature $T_{mid} \sim 185 (R/10au)^{-1.27} K$. The observed disk contains a $m=1$ spiral substructure; we use our model to predict the spiral's pitch angle and the prediction is consistent with the observations. This agreement serves as both a test of our model and strong evidence of the gravitational nature of the spiral. Our model estimates a maximum grain size $a_{max}\sim 196(R/10au)^{-2.45} \mu m$, which is consistent with grain growth being capped by a fragmentation barrier with threshold velocity $\sim 1 m/s$. We further demonstrate that observational properties of TMC1A are typical among the observed population of Class 0/I disks, which hints that traditional methods of disk data analyses based on Gaussian fitting and the assumption of the optically thin dust emission could have systematically underestimated disk size and mass and overestimated grain size.
#### Outflowing helium from a mature mini-Neptune

 - **Abstract**
 We announce the detection of escaping helium from TOI 2134b, a mini-Neptune a few Gyr old. The average in-transit absorption spectrum shows a peak of 0.37 +- 0.05% and an equivalent width of $W_{\rm avg}=3.3 \pm 0.3$ m$\r{A}$. Among all planets with helium detections, TOI 2134b is the only mature mini-Neptune, has the smallest helium signal, and experiences the lowest XUV flux. Putting TOI 2134b in the context of all other helium detections, we report the detection of a strong (p=3.0e-5) and theoretically expected correlation between $F_{\rm XUV}/\rho_{\rm XUV}$ (proportional to the energy-limited mass loss rate) and $R_* W_{\rm avg}$ (roughly proportional to the observationally inferred mass loss rate). Here, $W_{\rm avg}$ is the equivalent width of the helium absorption and $\rho_{\rm XUV}$ is the density of the planet within the XUV photosphere, but the correlation is similarly strong if we use the optical photosphere. TOI 2134b anchors the relation, having the lowest value on both axes. We encourage further observations to fill in missing regions of this parameter space and improve estimates of $F_{\rm XUV}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory~(LHAASO) opens the window of ultra-high-energy~(UHE) photon detection, broadens the path of testing basic physical concept such as Lorentz symmetry, and brings possibility of potential high-energy physical phenomenon research such as photon decay and electron decay. Currently, the UHE photons from LHAASO observation set strict constraints on photon and electron Lorentz symmetry violation~(LV) effects. To obtain a global impression of the photon-electron LV parameter plane, we make a detailed analysis for photon decay and electron decay. Our discussion gives the corresponding decay thresholds and energy-momentum distributions in different LV parameter configurations. We get corresponding constraints on photon LV parameter, electron LV parameter and the photon-electron LV parameter plane from LHAASO observation. For the space allowed for LV effect, that is beyond relativity, we also provide corresponding boundaries from LHAASO observation.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Potentially hazardous asteroids (PHA) in Earth-crossing orbits pose a constant threat to life on Earth. Several mitigation methods have been proposed, and the most feasible technique appears to be the disintegration of the impactor and the generation of a fragment cloud by explosive penetrators at interception. Mitigation analyses, however neglect the effect of orbital dynamics on fragments trajectory. Aims: We aim at studying the effect of orbital dynamics of the impactor's cloud on the number of fragments that hit the Earth assuming different interception dates. The effect of self-gravitational cohesion and the axial rotation of the impactor are also investigated. Methods: The orbits of 10^5 fragments are computed with a high-precision direct N-body integrator of the 8th order, running on GPUs. We consider orbital perturbations from all large bodies in the Solar System and the self-gravity of the cloud fragments. Results: Using a series of numerical experiments, we show that orbital shear causes the fragment cloud to adopt the shape of a triaxial ellipsoid. The shape and alignment of the triaxial ellipsoid are strongly modulated by the cloud's orbital trajectory, and hence the impact cross-section of the cloud with respect to the Earth. Therefore, the number of fragments hitting the Earth is strongly influenced by the orbit of the impactor and the time of interception. A minimum number of impacts occurs for a well-defined orientation of the impactor rotational axis, depending on the date of interception. Conclusions: To minimise the lethal consequences of an PHA's impact, a well-constrained interception timing is necessary. Too early interception may not be ideal for PHAs in the Apollo or Aten groups. The best time to intercept PHA is when it is at the pericentre of its orbit.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of our analysis of multiwavelength observations for the long gamma-ray burst GRB 200829A. The burst redshift $z \approx 1.29 \pm 0.04$ has been determined photometrically at the afterglow phase. In gamma rays the event is one of the brightest (in isotropic equivalent), $E_{iso} \gtrsim 10^{54}$ erg. The multicolor light curve of the GRB 200829A afterglow is characterized by chromatic behavior and the presence of a plateau gradually transitioning into a power-law decay that can also be interpreted as a quasi-synchronous inhomogeneity (flare). We assume that the presence of a chromatic inhomogeneity in the early afterglow is consistent with the model of a structured jet.
#### Ultracool Dwarfs Observed with the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph:  Equatorial Latitudes in L Dwarf Atmospheres are Cloudier

 - **Abstract**
 We report direct observational evidence for a latitudinal dependence of dust cloud opacity in ultracool dwarfs, indicating that equatorial latitudes are cloudier than polar latitudes. These results are based on a strong positive correlation between the viewing geometry and the mid-infrared silicate absorption strength in mid-L dwarfs using mid-infrared spectra from the Spitzer Space Telescope and spin axis inclination measurements from available information in the literature. We confirmed that the infrared color anomalies of L dwarfs positively correlate with dust cloud opacity and viewing geometry, where redder objects are inclined equator-on and exhibit more opaque dust clouds while dwarfs viewed at higher latitudes and with more transparent clouds are bluer. These results show the relevance of viewing geometry to explain the appearance of brown dwarfs and provide insight into the spectral diversity observed in substellar and planetary atmospheres. We also find a hint that dust clouds at similar latitudes may have higher opacity in low-surface gravity dwarfs than in higher-gravity objects.

#### The Ultraviolet to Mid-infrared Extinction Law of the Taurus Molecular  Cloud Based on the Gaia DR3, GALEX, APASS, Pan-STARRS1, 2MASS, and WISE  Surveys

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar dust extinction law is essential for interpreting observations. In this work, we investigate the ultraviolet (UV)--mid-infrared (IR) extinction law of the Taurus molecular cloud and its possible variations. We select 504,988 dwarf stars (4200 K < Teff < 8000 K) and 4,757 giant stars (4200 K < Teff < 5200 K) based on the stellar parameters of Gaia DR3 as tracers. We establish the Teff--intrinsic color relations and determine the intrinsic color indices and color excesses for different types of stars. In the determination of color excess ratios (CERs), we analyze and correct the curvature of CERs and derive the UV--mid-IR CERs of 16 bands. We consider different effective wavelengths for different types of stars when converting CERs to relative extinction, and obtain the extinction law with a better wavelength resolution. In addition, we analyze the possible regional variation of extinction law and derive the average extinction law of Rv=3.13+-0.32 for the Taurus molecular cloud. Only 0.9% of subregions have deviations >3sigma, indicating limited regional variation in the extinction law. We also discuss the effect of Gaia Teff overestimation on the determination of the Taurus extinction law and find that the effect is negligible.

 - **Abstract**
 Many interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs) are believed to be produced on the surfaces of icy grains at low temperatures. Atomic carbon is considered responsible for the skeletal evolution processes, such as C-C bond formation, via insertion or addition reactions. Before reactions, C atoms must diffuse on the surface to encounter reaction partners; therefore, information on their diffusion process is critically important for evaluating the role of C atoms in the formation of COMs. In situ detection of C atoms on ice was achieved by a combination of photostimulated desorption and resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization methods. We found that C atoms weakly bound to the ice surface diffused approximately above 30 K and produced C2 molecules. The activation energy for C-atom surface diffusion was experimentally determined to be 88 meV (1,020 K), indicating that the diffusive reaction of C atoms is activated at approximately 22 K on interstellar ice. The facile diffusion of C at T > 22 K atoms on interstellar ice opens a previously overlooked chemical regime where the increase in complexity of COMs as driven by C atoms. Carbon addition chemistry can be an alternative source of chemical complexity in translucent clouds and protoplanetary disks with crucial implications in our current understanding on the origin and evolution of organic chemistry in our Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 In the last decade, a dozen close-in giant planets have been discovered orbiting stars with spectral types ranging from M0 to M4, a mystery since known formation pathways do not predict the existence of such systems. Here, we confirm TOI-4860 b, a Jupiter-sized planet orbiting an M4.5 host, a star at the transition between fully and partially convective interiors. First identified with TESS data, we validate the transiting companion's planetary nature through multicolour photometry from the TRAPPIST-South/North, SPECULOOS, and MuSCAT3 facilities. Our analysis yields a radius of $0.76 \pm 0.02~ \rm R_{Jup}$ for the planet, a mass of $0.34~\rm M_\odot$ for the star, and an orbital period of 1.52 d. Using the newly commissioned SPIRIT InGaAs camera at the SPECULOOS-South Observatory, we collect infrared photometry in zYJ that spans the time of secondary eclipse. These observations do not detect a secondary eclipse, placing an upper limit on the brightness of the companion. The planetary nature of the companion is further confirmed through high-resolution spectroscopy obtained with the IRD spectrograph at Subaru Telescope, from which we measure a mass of $0.67 \pm 0.14~\rm M_{Jup}$ . Based on its overall density, TOI-4860 b appears to be rich in heavy elements, like its host star.
#### Open superclusters I: The most populated primordial groups of open  clusters in the third quadrant of the Galactic disc

 - **Abstract**
 An open supercluster (OSC) is defined as a cluster of at least six open clusters (OCs) born from the same giant molecular cloud (GMC). We survey the recent catalogs of OCs based on Gaia data and relevant literature to find 17 OSCs of the third galactic quadrant, along with 190 likely members of them. OSCs are frequent enough to be considered an extra class of objects in the hierarchy of star formation. Some of these supersystems are new and most of them contain more members than previously thought. The detailed study of some OSCs has leaded to the discovery of four new young clusters that are members of them, named Casado-Hendy 2 to 5. In certain instances, subgroups with distinct PMs or 3D positions have been found within an OSC, suggesting the presence of multiple generations of stars formed from several bursts of star formation within the same GMC. OSCs are typically unbound and tend to disintegrate on timescales of 0.1 Gyr. The present results support the Primordial Group hypothesis (Casado 2022) and suggest that globular clusters are not formed from the accretion of open superclusters, at least in the local Universe at late times.
#### On the stability around Chariklo and the confinement of its rings

 - **Abstract**
 Chariklo has two narrow and dense rings, C1R and C2R, located at 391 km and 405 km, respectively. In the light of new stellar occultation data, we study the stability around Chariklo. We also analyse three confinement mechanisms, to prevent the spreading of the rings, based on shepherd satellites in resonance with the edges of the rings. This study is made through a set of numerical simulations and the Poincar\'e surface of section technique. From the numerical simulation results we verify that, from the current parameters referring to the shape of Chariklo, the inner edge of the stable region is much closer to Chariklo than the rings. The Poincar\'e surface of sections allow us to identify the first kind periodic and quasi-periodic orbits, and also the resonant islands corresponding to the 1:2, 2:5, and 1:3 resonances. We construct a map of a versus e space which gives the location and width of the stable region and the 1:2, 2:5, and 1:3 resonances. We found that the first kind periodic orbits family can be responsible for a stable region whose location and size meet that of C1R, for specific values of the ring particles' eccentricities. However, C2R is located in an unstable region if the width of the ring is assumed to be about 120 m. After analysing different systems we propose that the best confinement mechanism is composed of three satellites, two of them shepherding the inner edge of C1R and the outer edge of C2R, while the third satellite would be trapped in the 1:3 resonance.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Observatory provides our highest-statistics picture of the cosmic-ray arrival directions in the Southern Hemisphere, with over 700 billion cosmic-ray-induced muon events collected between May 2011 and May 2022. Using the larger data volume, we find an improved significance of the PeV cosmic ray anisotropy down to scales of $6^\circ$. In addition, we observe a variation in the angular power spectrum as a function of energy, hinting at a relative decrease in large-scale features above 100 TeV. The data-taking period covers a complete solar cycle, providing new insight into the time variability of the signal. We present preliminary results using this up-to-date event sample.

 We present the results of N-body simulations meant to reproduce the long-term effects of mutually inclined exoplanets on debris disks, using the HD 202628 system as a proxy. HD 202628 is a Gyr-old solar-type star that possesses a directly observable, narrow debris ring with a clearly defined inner edge and non-zero eccentricity, hinting at the existence of a sculpting exoplanet. The eccentric nature of the disk leads us to examine the effect on it over Gyr timescales from an eccentric and inclined planet, placed on its orbit through scattering processes. We find that, in systems with dynamical timescales akin to that of HD 202628, a planetary companion is capable of completely tilting the debris disk. This tilt is preserved over the Gyr age of the system. Simulated observations of our models show that an exoplanet around HD 202628 with an inclination misalignment $\gtrsim\,10$ degrees would cause the disk to be observably diffuse and broad, which is inconsistent with ALMA observations. With these observations, we conclude that if there is an exoplanet shaping this disk, it likely had a mutual inclination of less than 5 degrees with the primordial disk. Conclusions of this work can be either applied to debris disks appearing as narrow rings (e.g., Fomalhaut, HR 4796), or to disks that are vertically thick at ALMA wavelengths (e.g., HD 110058).

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of rapid rotation in massive stars remains debated, although binary interactions are now often advocated as a cause. However, the broad and shallow lines in the spectra of fast rotators make direct detection of binarity difficult. In this paper, we report on the discovery and analysis of multiplicity for three fast-rotating massive stars: HD25631 (B3V), HD191495 (B0V), and HD46485 (O7V). They display strikingly similar TESS light curves, with two narrow eclipses superimposed on a sinusoidal variation due to reflection effects. We complement these photometric data by spectroscopy from various instruments (X-Shooter, Espadons, FUSE...), to further constrain the nature of these systems. The detailed analyses of these data demonstrates that the companions of the massive OB stars have low masses (~1Msol) with rather large radii (2-4 Rsol) and low temperatures (<15 kK). These companions display no UV signature, which would exclude a hot subdwarf nature, but disentangling of the large set of X-Shooter spectra of HD25631 revealed the typical signature of chromospheric activity in the companion's spectrum. In addition, despite the short orbital periods (P=3-7d), the fast-rotating OB-stars still display non-synchronized rotation and all systems appear young (<20Myr). This suggests that, as in a few other cases, these massive stars are paired in those systems with non-degenerate, low-mass PMS companions, implying that fast rotation would not be a consequence of a past binary interactions in their case.

 We present a study of the tilt-to-length coupling noise during the LISA Pathfinder mission and how it depended on the system's alignment. Tilt-to-length coupling noise is the unwanted coupling of angular and lateral spacecraft or test mass motion into the primary interferometric displacement readout. It was one of the major noise sources in the LISA Pathfinder mission and is likewise expected to be a primary noise source in LISA. We demonstrate here that a recently derived and published analytical model describes the dependency of the LISA Pathfinder tilt-to-length coupling noise on the alignment of the two freely falling test masses. This was verified with the data taken before and after the realignments performed in March (engineering days) and June 2016, and during a two-day experiment in February 2017 (long cross-talk experiment). The latter was performed with the explicit goal of testing the tilt-to-length coupling noise dependency on the test mass alignment. Using the analytical model, we show that all realignments performed during the mission were only partially successful and explain the reasons why. In addition to the analytical model, we computed another physical tilt-to-length coupling model via a minimising routine making use of the long cross-talk experiment data. A similar approach could prove useful for the LISA mission.

 - **Abstract**
 Here we show how $H_0$ can be derived purely from the gravitational waves (GW) of neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. This new method provides an estimate of $H_0$ spanning the redshift range, $z<0.25$ with current GW sensitivity and without the need for any afterglow detection. We utilise the inherently tight neutron star mass function together with the NSBH waveform amplitude and frequency to estimate distance and redshift respectively, thereby obtaining $H_0$ statistically. Our first estimate is $H_0 = 86^{+55}_{-46}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for the secure NSBH events GW190426 and GW200115. We forecast that soon, with 10 more such NSBH events we can reach competitive precision of $\delta H_0/H_0 \lesssim 20\%$.

 Cepheids have been the cornerstone of the extragalactic distance scale for a century. With high-quality data, these luminous supergiants exhibit a small dispersion in their Leavitt (period-luminosity) relation, particularly at longer wavelengths, and few methods rival the precision possible with Cepheid distances. In these proceedings, we present an overview of major observational programs pertaining to the Cepheid extragalactic distance scale, its progress and remaining challenges. In addition, we present preliminary new results on Cepheids from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The launch of JWST has opened a new chapter in the measurement of extragalactic distances and the Hubble constant. JWST offers a resolution three times that of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) with nearly 10 times the sensitivity. It has been suggested that the discrepancy in the value of the Hubble constant based on Cepheids compared to that inferred from measurements of the cosmic microwave background requires new and additional physics beyond the standard cosmological model. JWST observations will be critical in reducing remaining systematics in the Cepheid measurements and for confirming if new physics is indeed required. Early JWST data for the galaxy, NGC 7250 show a decrease in scatter in the Cepheid Leavitt law by a factor of two relative to existing HST data and demonstrate that crowding/blending effects are a significant issue in a galaxy as close as 20 Mpc.

 - **Abstract**
 High-contrast imaging of debris disk systems permits us to assess the composition and size distribution of circumstellar dust, to probe recent dynamical histories, and to directly detect and characterize embedded exoplanets. Observations of these systems in the infrared beyond 2--3 $\mu$m promise access to both extremely favorable planet contrasts and numerous scattered-light spectral features -- but have typically been inhibited by the brightness of the sky at these wavelengths. We present coronagraphy of the AU Microscopii (AU Mic) system using JWST's Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) in two filters spanning 3--5 $\mu$m. These data provide the first images of the system's famous debris disk at these wavelengths and permit additional constraints on its properties and morphology. Conducting a deep search for companions in these data, we do not identify any compelling candidates. However, with sensitivity sufficient to recover planets as small as $\sim 0.1$ Jupiter masses beyond $\sim 2^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim 20$ au) with $5\sigma$ confidence, these data place significant constraints on any massive companions that might still remain at large separations and provide additional context for the compact, multi-planet system orbiting very close-in. The observations presented here highlight NIRCam's unique capabilities for probing similar disks in this largely unexplored wavelength range, and provide the deepest direct imaging constraints on wide-orbit giant planets in this very well studied benchmark system.
