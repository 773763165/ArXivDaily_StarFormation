          votess: A multi-target, GPU-capable, parallel Voronoi tessellator

 - **Abstract**
 votess is a library for computing parallel 3D Voronoi tessellations on heterogeneous platforms, from CPUs and GPUs, to future accelerator architectures. To do so, it leverages the SYCL abstraction layer to achieve portability and performance across these architectures. The core library is an implementation of a Voronoi cell-by-cell computation algorithm, producing the geometry of the cells and their neighbor connectivity information, rather than a full combinatorial mesh data structure. This simplifies the Voronoi tessellation and makes it more suitable to data parallel architectures than alternatives such as sequential insertion or the Bowyer-Watson algorithm. The library demonstrates significant performance improvements over established single-threaded programs and serves as a foundational tool for performance-critical applications, such as on-the-fly computations in hydrodynamical codes.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study we present a detailed analysis of CN Lyn, an overlooked triple star system, by combining spectroscopic data from the literature, photometric \textit{TESS} data, and kinematic techniques. We updated the fundamental parameters of the known eclipsing components in the system with high precision. The chemical composition of both eclipsing components (Aab) and the third component (B) in the system were calculated with great accuracy. According to our analysis the mass, radius, and metallicity of the eclipsing components are $1.166_{-0.012}^{+0.013}\,M_\odot$, $1.786_{-0.014}^{+0.013}\,R_\odot$, and $-0.78_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$ dex for Aa and $1.143_{-0.012}^{+0.013}\,M_\odot$, $1.651_{-0.013}^{+0.014}\,R_\odot$, and $-0.55_{-0.02}^{+0.03}$ dex for Ab. The pair's age is $3.89_{-0.10}^{+0.10}$ Gyr. The mass, radius, metallicity, and age for B are $0.85_{-0.23}^{+0.23}\,M_\odot$, $1.436_{-0.023}^{+0.026}\,R_\odot$, $-1.83_{-0.11}^{+0.09}$ dex, and $12.5_{-2.5}^{+2.5}$ Gyr, respectively. It is also found that the triple system (AabB) satisfies the stability criteria for the hierarchical triple system. Kinematic and Galactic orbital parameters of CN Lyn were obtained from the astrometric and spectroscopic data of the system. Dynamical orbital analyses, taking into account the ages of the component stars in the central binary system (A) show that the CN Lyn originated at the metal-poor edge of the Galactic disk. The third component of the system was found to be a member of the halo population in terms of age, $\alpha$ elements and metal abundance. Given the different chemical abundances and age of B compared to A, this suggests that the third component was captured by the central system in a region with weak gravitational interactions far beyond the Galactic disc.

          Going from 3D common-envelope simulations to fast 1D simulations

 - **Abstract**
 One-dimensional (1D) methods for simulating the common-envelope (CE) phase offer advantages over three-dimensional (3D) simulations regarding their computational speed and feasibility. We present the 1D CE method from Bronner et al. (2024), including the results of the CE simulations of an asymptotic giant branch star donor. We further test this method in the massive star regime by computing the CE event of a red supergiant with a neutron-star mass and a black-hole mass companion. The 1D model can reproduce the orbital evolution and the envelope ejection from 3D simulations when choosing suitable values for the free parameters in the model. The best-fitting values differ from the expectations based on the low mass simulations, indicating that the free parameters depend on the structure of the giant star. The released recombination energy from hydrogen and helium helps to expand the envelope, similar to the low-mass CE simulations.

          True mass and atmospheric composition of the non-transiting hot Jupiter HD 143105 b

 - **Abstract**
 We present Keck/KPIC phase II $K$-band observations of the non-transiting hot Jupiter HD 143105 b. Using a cross-correlation approach, we make the first detection of the planetary atmosphere at $K_p = 185^{+11}_{-13}\rm km\ s^{-1}$ and an inferior conjunction time 2.5 hours before the previously-published ephemeris. The retrieved $K_p$ value, in combination with orbital period, mass of the host star, and lack of transit detection, gives an orbital inclination of $78^{\circ+2}_{-12}$ and a true planet mass of 1.23$\pm0.10\rm\ M_J$. While the equilibrium temperature of HD 143105 b is in the transition regime between non-inverted and inverted atmospheres, our analysis strongly prefers a non-inverted atmosphere. Retrieval analysis indicates the atmosphere of HD 143105 b is cloud-free to approximately 1 bar and dominated by H$_2$O absorption ($\log \rm H_2O_{MMR} = -3.9^{+0.8}_{-0.5}$), placing only an upper limit on the CO abundance ($\log \rm CO_{MMR} < -3.7$ at 95% confidence). We place no constraints on the abundances of Fe, Mg, or $^{13}$CO. From these abundances, we place an upper limit on the carbon-to-oxygen ratio for HD 143105 b, $\rm C/O < 0.2$ at 95% confidence, and find the atmospheric metallicity is approximately $0.1\times$ solar. The low metallicity may be responsible for the lack of a thermal inversion, which at the temperature of HD 143105 b would likely require significant opacity from TiO and/or VO. With these results, HD 143105 b joins the small number of non-transiting hot Jupiters with detected atmospheres.

          A compact group lens modeled with GIGA-Lens: Enhanced inference for complex systems

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of large-scale astronomical surveys, fast modeling of strong lens systems has become increasingly vital. While significant progress has been made for galaxy-scale lenses, the development of automated methods for modeling larger systems, such as groups and clusters, is not as extensive. Our study aims to extend the capabilities of the GIGA-Lens code, enhancing its efficiency in modeling multi-galaxy strong lens systems. We focus on demonstrating the potential of GPU-accelerated Bayesian inference in handling complex lensing scenarios with a high number of free parameters. We employ an improved inference approach that combines image position and pixelated data with an annealing sampling technique to obtain the posterior distribution of complex models. This method allows us to overcome the challenge of limited prior information, a high number of parameters, and memory usage. Our process is exemplified through the analysis of the compact group lens system DES J0248-3955, for which we present VLT/X-shooter spectra. We measure a redshift of $z = 0.69 \pm 0.04$ for the group, and $z = 1.2722 \pm 0.0005$ for one of the extended arcs. Our enhanced method successfully constrained a lens model with 29 free parameters and lax priors in a remarkably short time. The mass of the lens is well described by a single dark-matter halo with a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_v = (690 \pm 30) \, km \, s^{-1}$. The model predicts the presence of a second source at the same redshift and a third source at approximately $z \sim 2.7$. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of our lens modeling technique for dealing with a complex system in a short time using ground-based data. This presents considerable potential within the context of large surveys such as LSST.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical N-body simulations are commonly used to explore stability regions around exoplanets, offering insights into the possible existence of satellites and ring systems. This study aims to utilize Machine Learning (ML) techniques to generate predictive maps of stable regions surrounding a hypothetical planet. The approach can also be extended to planet-satellite systems, planetary ring systems, and other similar configurations. A dataset was generated using 10^5 numerical simulations, each incorporating nine orbital features for the planet and a test particle in a star-planet-test particle system. The simulations were classified as stable or unstable based on stability criteria, requiring particles to remain stable over a timespan equivalent to 10,000 orbital periods of the planet. Various ML algorithms were tested and fine-tuned through hyperparameter optimization to determine the most effective predictive model. Tree-based algorithms showed comparable accuracy in performance. The best-performing model, using the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, achieved an accuracy of 98.48%, with 94% recall and precision for stable particles and 99% for unstable particles. ML algorithms significantly reduce the computational time required for three-body simulations, operating approximately 100,000 times faster than traditional numerical methods. Predictive models can generate entire stability maps in less than a second, compared to the days required by numerical simulations. The results from the trained ML models will be made accessible through a public web interface, enabling broader scientific applications.

          A substellar flyby that shaped the orbits of the giant planets

 - **Abstract**
 The modestly eccentric and non-coplanar orbits of the giant planets pose a challenge to solar system formation theories which generally indicate that the giant planets emerged from the protoplanetary disk in nearly perfectly circular and coplanar orbits. We demonstrate that a single encounter with a 2-50 Jupiter-mass object, passing through the solar system at a perihelion distance less than 20 AU and a hyperbolic excess velocity less than 6 km/s, can excite the giant planets' eccentricities and mutual inclinations to values comparable to those observed. We estimate that there is about a 1-in-100 chance that such a flyby produces a dynamical architecture similar to that of the solar system. We describe a metric to evaluate how closely a simulated system matches the eccentricity and inclination secular modes of the solar system. The scenario of a close encounter with a substellar object offers a plausible explanation for the origin of the moderate eccentricities and inclinations and the secular architecture of the planets.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a search for new ultracool companions to nearby white dwarfs using multiple methods, including the analysis of colors and examination of images in both the optical and the infrared. Through this process, we identified fifty-one previously unrecognized systems with candidate ultracool companions. Thirty-one of these systems are resolved in at least one catalog, and all but six are confirmed as co-moving companions via common proper motion and consistent parallax measurements (when available). We have followed up four co-moving companions with near-infrared spectroscopy and confirm their ultracool nature. The remaining twenty candidates are unresolved, but show clear signs of infrared excess which is most likely due to the presence of a cold, low-mass companion or a dusty circumstellar disk. Three of these unresolved systems have existing optical spectra that clearly show the presence of a cool stellar companion to the white dwarf primary via spectral decomposition. These new discoveries, along with our age estimates for the primary white dwarfs, will serve as valuable benchmark systems for future characterization of ultracool dwarfs.

          Chondrites as thermal and mechanical archives of accretion processes in the Solar protoplanetary disk

 - **Abstract**
 As some of the most ancient materials in our Solar System, chondritic meteorites offer a valuable window into the early stages of planetary formation, particularly the accretion processes that built the most primitive asteroids. Until now, high energy shocks and collisions have been invoked to explain the deformation and fragmentation of chondrules, the main component of chondrites. However, simulating the cooling of chondrules using continuum mechanics and finite elements, we demonstrate that plastic deformation of chondrules can occur at low collision velocities of just a few meters per second and with kinetic energies less than tenths of a millijoule when temperatures exceed the glass transition temperature Tg ~ 1000 K. Conversely, below Tg, spontaneous chondrule cracking occurs due to differential thermal contraction between phases and is more pronounced in larger chondrules. Counterintuitively, our findings suggest that both ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites formed through similar low-energy processes, with varying degrees of ductility and brittleness depending on the amount of processed material. This implies that the environments where chondrites formed were likely less turbulent and more thermally active than previously thought.

          SDSS J100711.74+193056.2: A Candidate Common Motion Substellar Companion to the Nearest B-Type Star Regulus

 - **Abstract**
 The L9 dwarf SDSS J100711.74+193056.2 is situated 7$^{\circ}$.5 north of the nearest B-type star Regulus (d = 24.3+-0.2 pc), part of a stellar quadruplet. The object is at similar distance (d = 21.9+-1.0 pc) as Regulus, with a 3D separation of 3.9+0.6-0.5 pc ($\sim$1.6 tidal radii from Regulus), and shares tangential motion within 2 km/s, hinting at a physical connection. Near-infrared spectroscopy with Keck/NIRES finds that SDSS J100711.74+193056.2 also has a comparable radial velocity as Regulus A and B, a metallicity similar to Regulus B, and a spectral morphology consistent with the estimated 1--2 Gyr total age of Regulus's close pre-white dwarf companion. Taken together, these observations indicate that SDSS J100711.74+193056.2 is a very widely-separated and potentially physically-bound companion to Regulus, with a binding energy and mass ratio comparable to other wide star-brown dwarf systems. It joins a growing list of brown dwarfs at the L dwarf/T dwarf transition with independent constraints on physical properties such as age and metallicity.

 - **Abstract**
 In this third paper in a series, we investigate the need of spectra denoising for the derivation of stellar parameters. We have used two distinct datasets for this work. The first one contains spectra in the range of 4450-5400 Å at a resolution of 42000 and the second in the range of 8400-8800 Å at a resolution of 11500. We constructed two denoising techniques, an autoencoder, and a Principal Component Analysis. Using random Gaussian noise added to synthetic spectra, we have trained a Neural Network to derive the stellar parameters Teff, log g, ve sin i, {\xi}t, and [M/H] of the denoised spectra. We find that, independently of the denoising technique, the stellar parameters accuracy values do not improve once we denoise the synthetic spectra. This is true with and without applying data augmentation to the stellar parameters Neural Network.

          Measuring the Hubble constant through the galaxy pairwise peculiar velocity

 - **Abstract**
 The Hubble constant $H_0$, the current expansion rate of the universe, is one of the most important parameters in cosmology. The cosmic expansion regulates the mutually approaching motion of a pair of celestial objects due to their gravity. Therefore, the mean pairwise peculiar velocity of celestial objects, which quantifies their relative motion, is sensitive to both $H_0$ and the dimensionless total matter density $\Omega_m$. Based on this, using the Cosmicflows-4 data, we measured $H_0$ for the first time via the galaxy pairwise velocity in the nonlinear and quasi-linear range. Our results yield $H_0=75.5\pm1.4$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $\Omega_m=0.311^{+0.029}_{-0.028}$ . The uncertainties of $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$ can be improved to around 0.6% and 2%, respectively, if the statistical errors become negligible in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 About one third of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) sources are unassociated. We perform multi-class classification of Fermi-LAT sources using machine learning with the goal of probabilistic classification of the unassociated sources. A particular attention is paid to the fact that the distributions of associated and unassociated sources are different as functions of source parameters. In this work, we address this problem in the framework of dataset shifts in machine learning.

          Water Enrichment from Pebble Drift in Disks with Gap-forming Planets

 - **Abstract**
 Volatiles like $H_2O$ are present as ice in solids in the outer cold regions of protoplanetary disks and as vapor in the warm inner regions within the water snow line. Icy pebbles drifting inwards from the outer disk sublimate after crossing the snow line, enriching the inner disk with solid mass and water vapor. Meanwhile, proto-planets forming within the disk open gaps in the disk gas, creating traps against the inward drift of pebbles and in turn reducing water enrichment in the inner disk. Recent disk observations from millimeter interferometry and infrared spectroscopy have supported this broad picture by finding a correlation between the outer radial distribution of pebbles and the properties of inner water vapor spectra. In this work, we aim at further informing previous and future observations by building on previous models to explore pebble drift in disks with multiple gaps. We systematically explore multiple gap locations and their depths (equivalent to specific masses of planets forming within), and different particle sizes to study their impact on inner disk water enrichment. We find that the presence of close-in deep gaps carved by a Jupiter-mass planet is likely crucial for blocking icy pebble delivery into the inner disk, while planets with lower masses only provide leaky traps. We also find that disks with multiple gaps show lower vapor enrichment in the inner disk. Altogether, these model results support the idea that inner disk water delivery and planet formation are regulated by the mass and location of the most massive planets.

 - **Abstract**
 The Compton Spectrometer and Imager balloon payload (COSI-Balloon) is a wide-field-of-view Compton ${\gamma}$-ray telescope that operates in the 0.2 - 5 MeV bandpass. COSI-Balloon had a successful 46-day flight in 2016 during which the instrument observed the Crab Nebula, Cygnus X-1, and Centaurus A. Using the data collected by the COSI-Balloon instrument during this flight, we present the source flux extraction of signals from the variable balloon background environment and produce images of these background-dominated sources by performing Richardson-Lucy deconvolutions. We also present the spectra measured by the COSI-Balloon instrument, compare and combine them with measurements from other instruments, and fit the data. The Crab Nebula was observed by COSI-Balloon and we obtain a measured flux in the energy band 325 - 480 keV of (4.5 ${\pm}$ 1.6) ${\times}$ 10$^{-3}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The model that best fits the COSI-Balloon data combined with measurements from NuSTAR and Swift-BAT is a broken power law with a measured photon index ${\Gamma}$ = 2.20 ${\pm}$ 0.02 above the 43 keV break. Cygnus X-1 was also observed during this flight, and we obtain a measured flux of (1.4 ${\pm}$ 0.2) ${\times}$ 10$^{-3}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the same energy band and a best-fit result (including data from NuSTAR, Swift-BAT, and INTEGRAL/ IBIS) was to a cutoff power law with a high-energy cutoff energy of 138.3 ${\pm}$ 1.0 keV and a photon index of ${\Gamma}$ = 1.358 ${\pm}$ 0.002. Lastly, we present the measured spectrum of Centaurus A and our best model fit to a power law with a photon index of ${\Gamma}$ = 1.73 ${\pm}$ 0.01.

          Testing $f(R)$ Gravity from Cosmic Shear Measurements

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we perform a detailed analysis to constrain the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity model, using cosmic shear data from three prominent Stage-III weak lensing surveys: DES-Y3, KiDS-1000, and HSC-Y3. To accurately model the nonlinear matter clustering in the analysis of cosmic shear signals, we employ FREmu, a recently developed power spectrum emulator for the $f(R)$ gravity trained on the Quijote-MG simulations. This emulator achieves precise predictions, limiting the errors to 5% on scales of $0.009h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1} < k < 0.5h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Our findings reveal that cosmic shear data alone impose only weak constraints on the $f(R)$ parameter $\log_{10}|f_{R_0}|$. To improve these constraints, we incorporate state-of-the-art external observations, including data from the cosmic microwave background and baryon acoustic oscillations. The inclusion of these external datasets significantly enhances the constraints, yielding an upper limit of $\log_{10}|f_{R_0}| < -4.79$ at the 95% confidence level.

          On Disk Formation around Isolated Black Holes via Stream Accretion

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate accretion onto an isolated black hole from uniform winds. If the winds are directed towards the black hole, then the accretion process can be well described by the classical Bondi-Hoyle Lyttleton or BHL accretion. If the wind is not directed towards the black hole and flows past it, then a smaller fraction of the flow can be attracted by the black hole, and this type of accretion cannot be described by the classical BHL, and we coin the second kind as the lateral BHL. We show that the classical BHL cannot form an accretion disk, while lateral BHL can form transient accretion disks. To describe the thermodynamics of the flow, we have used a variable adiabatic index equation of state which depends on the temperature of the flow as well as the composition of the gas. We show that the electron-proton gas forms an accretion disk, which disappears and forms a shock cone, only to form the disk again at a later time, while for flows with less protons, the accretion disk, once lost, does not reappear again. Only when the flow is pair-dominated does it form a persistent accretion disk. We also show that a shock cone is less luminous than the accretion disk.

          PhaseTracer2: from the effective potential to gravitational waves

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, the prospect of detecting gravitational waves sourced from a strongly first-order cosmological phase transition has emerged as one of the most exciting frontiers of gravitational wave astronomy. Cosmological phase transitions are an essential ingredient in the Standard Model of particle cosmology, and help explain the mechanism for creation of matter in the early Universe, provide insights into fundamental theories of physics, and shed light on the nature of dark matter. This underscores the significance of developing robust end-to-end tools for determining the resulting gravitational waves from these phase transitions. In this article we present PhaseTracer2, an improved version of the C++ software package PhaseTracer, designed for mapping cosmological phases and transitions in Standard Model extensions of multiple scalar fields. Building on the robust framework of its predecessor, PhaseTracer2 extends its capabilities by including new features crucial for a more comprehensive analysis of cosmological phase transitions. It can calculate more complex properties, such as the bounce action through the path deformation method or an interface with BubbleProfiler, thermodynamic parameters, and gravitational wave spectra. Its applicability has also been broadened via incorporating the dimensionally reduced effective potential for models obtained from DRalgo, as well as calculations in the MSbar and OS-like renormalisation schemes. This modular, flexible, and practical upgrade retains the speed and stability of the original PhaseTracer, while significantly expanding its utility.

 - **Abstract**
 From 2012 to 2023, the PRISMA-32 array was in operation at the Experimental Complex NEVOD (MEPhI, Moscow). The purpose of the array was to study extensive air showers by detecting the air-shower neutron and electron-photon components using unshielded neutron detectors. To expand the capabilities of this facility, including for the study of cosmic and geophysical phenomena with a neutron flux, its upgrade was carried out. During the upgrade, a dedicated measuring channel for studying variations of the neutron background and the processes affecting these variations was created. To achieve this, the photomultipliers, the integrating amplifiers, the digitalizing electronics and the high-voltage power supply system were replaced. The paper describes the structure of the upgraded array, which was named PRISMA-36, and presents the results of studying the characteristics of the main elements of its "variation" channel. A method for identifying signals caused by neutron capture and the determined criteria for their selection are discussed. An example of a Forbush decrease, caused by a X1.1-class flare and recorded with the variation channel of the PRISMA-36 array, is given.

 - **Abstract**
 The inference of stellar parameters (such as radius and mass) through asteroseismic forward modelling depends on the number, accuracy, and precision of seismic and atmospheric constraints. ESA's Gaia space mission is providing precise parallaxes which yield an additional constraint to be included in the model grid search. Using a handful of main-sequence benchmark stars, we perform a uniform characterisation of these stars. We assess the accuracy and precision of stellar parameters inferred from grid-based searches when a Gaia-based luminosity is combined with different stellar constraints. We also examine the precision needed for an interferometric radius (model-independent radius) to have a significant contribution towards the determination of stellar mass in the optimisation process. Our findings show that more precise stellar masses are inferred for some stars when seismic and spectroscopic constraints are complemented with a Gaia-based luminosity, with a scatter varying from 1.9 per cent to 0.8 per cent. However, the inferred stellar radii are underestimated when compared to the interferometric radii and yield a scatter of $\sim$1.9 per cent. In addition, we demonstrate that a precisely measured interferometric radius ($\lesssim$ 1 per cent) when applied in the optimisation process yields a mass with a precision $\lesssim$ 1.5 per cent. Finally, we find that when only $l=0$ mode oscillation frequencies are available, robust masses and radii are still attainable. However, this requires precise and numerous $l=0$ mode oscillations frequencies ($>$ 8) to be coupled with atmospheric constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 In the incoming years, cosmological surveys aim at measuring the sum of neutrino masses $\Sigma m_\nu$, complementing the determination of their mass ordering from laboratory experiments. In order to assess the full potential of large-scale structures (LSS), we employ state-of-the-art predictions from the effective field theory of LSS (EFTofLSS) at one loop to perform Fisher forecasts on the sensitivity (combining power spectrum and bispectrum) of ongoing and future surveys (DESI, MegaMapper) in combination with CMB measurements (Planck, Litebird and Stage-4). We find that the 1$\sigma$ sensitivity on $\Sigma m_\nu$ is expected to be 15 meV with Planck+DESI, and 7 meV with S4+MegaMapper, where $\sim 10\%$ and $30\%$ of the constraints are brought by the one-loop bispectrum respectively. To understand how robust are these bounds, we explore how they are relaxed when considering extensions to the standard model, dubbed `new physics'. We find that the shift induced on $\Sigma m_\nu$ by a $1\sigma$ shift on new physics parameters (we consider extra relativistic species, neutrino self-interactions, curvature or a time-evolving electron mass) could be $\mathcal O(10)$ meV for Planck+DESI, but it will be suppressed down to $\mathcal O(1)$ meV in S4+MegaMapper. Our study highlights the quantitative impact of including the bispectrum at one loop in the EFTofLSS, and the robustness of the sensitivity to $\Sigma m_\nu$ against potential new physics thanks to the synergy of cosmological probes.

 - **Abstract**
 In Lammer et al. 2024, we defined Earth-like Habitats (EH) as rocky planets in the habitable zone of complex life (HZCL) on which Earth-like N$_2$-O$_2$-dominated atmospheres with minor amounts of CO$_2$ can exist and derived a formula for estimating their maximum number in the Galaxy. Here, we apply this formula by considering only requirements that are already scientifically quantifiable. By implementing models for star formation rate, initial mass function, and galactic mass distribution, we calculate the spatial distribution of disk stars as functions of stellar mass and birth age. We apply models for the GHZ and evaluate the thermal stability of Earth-like atmospheres with various CO$_2$ mixing ratios by implementing the newest stellar evolution and upper atmosphere models. In addition, we include the rocky exoplanet frequency, the availability of oceans and subaerial land, and the potential large moon requirement by evaluating their importance and implementing these criteria from minima to maxima values. We also discuss factors that are not yet scientifically quantifiable but may be requirements for EHs to evolve. We find that EHs are rare by obtaining maximum numbers of $2.5^{+71.6}_{-2.4}\times10^{5}$ and $0.6^{+27.1}_{-0.59}\times10^{5}$ planets that can potentially host N$_2$-Earth-like atmospheres with maximum CO$_2$ mixing ratios of 10\% and 1\%, respectively, implying that a minimum of $\sim 10^3 - 10^6$ rocky HZCL planets are needed for 1 EH to evolve. Their actual number, however, may be substantially lower as several requirements are not included in our model; this also implies ETIs are significantly rarer still. Our results illustrate that neither every star can host EHs, nor that each rocky HZCL planet evolves such that it may be able to host complex animal-like life. The Copernican Principle therefore cannot be applied to infer that such life is common in the Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 In this hypothesis article, we discuss the basic requirements of planetary environments where aerobe organisms can grow and survive, including atmospheric limitations of millimeter-to-meter-sized biological animal life based on physical limits, and O$_2$, N$_2$, and CO$_2$ toxicity levels. By assuming that animal-like extraterrestrial organisms adhere to similar limits, we define Earth-like Habitats ($\eta_{\rm EH}$) as rocky exoplanets in the Habitable Zone of Complex Life that host N$_2$-O$_2$-dominated atmospheres with minor amounts of CO$_2$, at which advanced animal-like life can in principle evolve and exist. We then derive a new formula that can be used to estimate the maximum occurrence rate of such Earth-like Habitats in the Galaxy. This contains realistic probabilistic arguments that can be fine-tuned and constrained by atmospheric characterization with future space and ground-based telescopes. As an example, we briefly discuss two specific requirements feeding into our new formula that, although not quantifiable at present, will become scientifically quantifiable in the upcoming decades due to future observations of exoplanets and their atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyzed the 7.92$\times 10^{11}$ cosmic-ray-induced muon events collected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory from May 13, 2011, when the fully constructed experiment started to take data, to May 12, 2023. This dataset provides an up-to-date cosmic-ray arrival direction distribution in the Southern Hemisphere with unprecedented statistical accuracy covering more than a full period length of a solar cycle. Improvements in Monte Carlo event simulation and better handling of year-to-year differences in data processing significantly reduce systematic uncertainties below the level of statistical fluctuations compared to the previously published results. We confirm the observation of a change in the angular structure of the cosmic-ray anisotropy between 10 TeV and 1 PeV, more specifically in the 100-300 TeV energy range.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a machine learning method to assign stellar parameters (temperature, surface gravity, metallicity) to the photometric data of large photometric surveys such as SDSS and SKYMAPPER. The method makes use of our previous effort in homogenizing and recalibrating spectroscopic data from surveys like APOGEE, GALAH, or LAMOST into a single catalog, which is used to inform a neural network. We obtain spectroscopic-quality parameters for millions of stars that have only been observed photometrically. The typical uncertainties are of the order of 100K in temperature, 0.1 dex in surface gravity, and 0.1 dex in metallicity and the method performs well down to low metallicity, were obtaining reliable results is known to be difficult.

 In this contribution we present the FAST, which is a comprehensive software suite that aims to streamline and automatically manage the forecast of atmospheric and astroclimatic parameters (provided respectively by Meso-Nh and Astro-Meso-Nh models) on large ground-based telescope installations. The forecast of the aforementioned parameters is becoming crucial for the operation of the large telescope installations which possess atmospheric-sensitive equipment equipped with Adaptive Optics (AO) systems. FAST performs automatically all the steps of an atmosphere forecast process: initialisation and forcing data, atmospheric simulation, postprocessing and managing of the this http URL role of such service is useful both in optimizing beforehand AO instruments to the next atmospheric conditions and in planning telescope observations (especially in "service mode") in order to maximize the scientific output. FAST was applied first to the ALTA Center project, which provides forecasts for the LBT telescope. Then it was extended to the more recent project FATE that is a similar forecast system applied to the VLT. Since its first version FAST evolved and it has has been modified to fit with the different technical specifications of the different projects gaining in modularity. It is now able to provide forecasts on different timescales (from days to hours before) and to provide forecast during night and day time. After several years of continuous development we can say that FAST reached full maturity and it is now ready for applications to other projects/sites.

          The effect of radiation pressure on the dispersal of photoevaporating discs

 - **Abstract**
 Observed IR excesses indicate that protoplanetary discs evolve slowly for the majority of their lifetime before losing their near- and mid-IR excesses on short timescales. Photoevaporation models can explain this "two-timescale" nature of disc evolution through the removal of inner regions of discs after a few million years. However, they also predict the existence of a population of non-accreting discs with large cavities. Such discs are scarce within the observed population, suggesting the models are incomplete. We explore whether radiation-pressure-driven outflows are able to remove enough dust to fit observations. We simulate these outflows using cuDisc, including dust dynamics, growth/fragmentation, radiative transfer and a parameterisation of internal photoevaporation. We find that, in most cases, dust mass-loss rates are around 5-10 times too small to meet observational constraints. Particles are launched from the disc inner rim, however grains larger than around a micron do not escape in the outflow, meaning mass-loss rates are too low for the initial dust masses at gap-opening. Only systems that have smooth photoevaporation profiles with gas mass-loss rates $>\sim 5 \times 10^{-9}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and disc dust masses $<\sim$1 $M_\oplus$ at the time of gap opening can meet observational constraints; in the current models these manifest as EUV winds driven by atypically large high-energy photon fluxes. We also find that the height of the disc's photosphere is controlled by small grains in the outflow as opposed to shadowing from a hot inner rim; the effect of this can be seen in synthetic scattered light observations.

 Orphan gamma-ray burst afterglows are good candidates to learn more about the GRB physics and progenitors or for the development of multi-messenger analysis with gravitational waves. Our objective is to identify orphan afterglows in Rubin LSST data, by using the characteristic features of their light curves. In this work, we generated a population of short GRBs based on the Swift SBAT4 catalogue, and we simulated their off-axis afterglow light curves with afterglowpy. We then used the rubin_sim package to simulate observations of these orphan afterglows with Rubin LSST and proceeded with the characterisation of orphan light curves by extracting a number of parameters. The same parameters are computed for the ELAsTiCC (Extended LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge) data set, a simulated alert stream of the Rubin LSST data. We then started to develop a machine learning filter able to discriminate orphan-like events among all the variable objects. We present here the performance of our filter as implemented in the Fink broker and tested on the ELAsTiCC data set and our own Rubin pseudo-observation simulations.

 Although Cherenkov detectors of high-energy neutrinos in ice and water are often optimized to detect TeV-PeV neutrinos, they may also be sensitive to transient neutrino sources in the 1-100~GeV energy range. A wide variety of transient sources have been predicted to emit GeV neutrinos. In light of the upcoming IceCube-Upgrade, which will extend the IceCube detector's sensitivity down to a few GeV, as well as improve its angular resolution, we survey a variety of transient source models and compare their predicted neutrino fluences to detector sensitivities, in particular those of IceCube-DeepCore and the IceCube Upgrade. We consider the ranges of neutrino fluence from transients powered by non-relativistic shocks, such as novae, supernovae, fast blue optical transients, and tidal disruption events. We also consider fast radio bursts and relativistic outflows of high- and low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts. Our study sheds light on the prospects of observing GeV transients with existing and upcoming neutrino facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismic inferences of main-sequence solar-like oscillators often rely on best-fit models. However, these models cannot fully reproduce the observed mode frequencies, suggesting that the internal structure of the model does not fully match that of the star. Asteroseismic structure inversions provide a way to test the interior of our stellar models. Recently, structure inversion techniques were used to study 12 stars with radiative cores. In this work, we extend that analysis to 43 main-sequence stars with convective cores observed by Kepler to look for differences in the sound speed profiles in the inner 30% of the star by radius. For around half of our stars, the structure inversions show that our models reproduce the internal structure of the star, where the inversions are sensitive, within the observational uncertainties. For the stars where our inversions reveal significant differences, we find cases where our model sound speed is too high and cases where our model sound speed is too low. We use the star with the most significant differences to explore several changes to the physics of our model in an attempt to resolve the inferred differences. These changes include using a different overshoot prescription and including the effects of diffusion, gravitational settling, and radiative levitation. We find that the resulting changes to the model structure are too small to resolve the differences shown in our inversions.

          C/O ratios in self-gravitating protoplanetary discs with dust evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Elemental abundances, particularly the C/O ratio, are seen as a way to connect the composition of planetary atmospheres with planet formation scenario and the disc chemical environment. We model the chemical composition of gas and ices in a self-gravitating disc on timescales of 0.5\,Myr since its formation to study the evolution of C/O ratio due to dust dynamics and growth, and phase transitions of the volatile species. We use the thin-disc hydrodynamic code FEOSAD, which includes disc self-gravity, thermal balance, dust evolution and turbulent diffusion, and treats dust as a dynamically different and evolving component interacting with the gas. It also describes freeze-out, sublimation and advection of four volatile species: H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO. We demonstrate the effect of gas and dust substructures on the distribution of volatiles and C/O ratios, including the formation of multiple snowlines of one species, and point out the anticorrelation between dust-to-gas ratio and total C/O ratio emerging due to the contribution of oxygen-rich ice mantles. We identify time and spatial locations where two distinct trigger mechanisms for planet formation are operating and differentiate them by C/O ratio range: wide range of the C/O ratios of $0-1.4$ for streaming instability, and a much narrower range $0.3-0.6$ for gravitational instability (with the initial value of 0.34). This conclusion is corroborated by observations, showing that transiting exoplanets, which possibly experienced migration through a variety of disc conditions, have significantly larger spread of C/O in comparison with directly imaged exoplanets likely formed in gravitationally unstable outer disk regions. We show that the ice-phase C/O$\approx0.2-0.3$ between the CO, CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ snowlines corresponds to the composition of the Solar system comets, that represent primordial planetesimals.

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of precision cosmology, the ability to generate accurate and large-scale galaxy catalogs is crucial for advancing our understanding of the universe. With the flood of cosmological data from current and upcoming missions, generating theoretical predictions to compare with these observations is essential for constraining key cosmological parameters. While traditional methods, such as the Halo-Occupation Distribution (HOD), have provided foundational insights, they struggle to balance the need for both accuracy and computational efficiency. High-fidelity hydrodynamic simulations offer improved precision but are computationally expensive and resource-intensive. In this work, we introduce a novel machine learning approach that harnesses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Diffusion Models, trained on the CAMELS simulation suite, to bridge the gap between computationally inexpensive dark matter simulations and the galaxy distributions of more costly hydrodynamic simulations. Our method not only outperforms traditional HOD techniques in accuracy but also significantly accelerates the simulation process, offering a scalable solution for next-generation cosmological surveys. This advancement has the potential to revolutionize galaxy catalog generation, enabling more precise, data-driven cosmological analyses.

          Millisecond Pulsars in Globular Clusters and Implications for the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess

 - **Abstract**
 We study the gamma-ray emission from millisecond pulsars within the Milky Way's globular cluster system in order to measure the luminosity function of this source population. We find that these pulsars have a mean luminosity of $\langle L_{\gamma}\rangle \sim (1-8)\times 10^{33}\, {\rm erg/s}$ (integrated between 0.1 and 100 GeV) and a log-normal width of $\sigma_L \sim 1.4-2.8$. If the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess were produced by pulsars with similar characteristics, Fermi would have already detected $N \sim 17-37$ of these sources, whereas only three such pulsar candidates have been identified. We conclude that the excess gamma-ray emission can originate from pulsars only if they are significantly less bright, on average, than those observed within globular clusters or in the Galactic Plane. This poses a serious challenge for pulsar interpretation of the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess.

          Using the helium triplet as a tracer of the physics of giant planet outflows

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrodynamic outflows, such as those observed escaping close-in gas giant planets, are not isothermal in structure. Their highly ionized nature allows them to cool adiabatically at distances beyond several planetary radii. The contrast between the hottest gas temperatures at around 10,000K and the coldest at around 1,000K triggers an excess population of the observable helium triplet. This excess is caused by the suppression of collisional de-excitation from the triplet state at cool temperatures. Using radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we show that this helium triplet excess may explain the excess broadening seen in HD 189733b's observed transmission spectrum, demonstrating adiabatic cooling of its outflow, confirming its hydrodynamic nature on scales of several planetary radii. However, further observations are required to confirm this conclusion. Furthermore, we explore a range of electron transitions for neutral helium which were not considered in the previous literature. We find that the He$2^1$S state is unavailable as a potential reservoir for He$2^3$S electrons. Additionally, the de-excitation to the ground state must be considered for stellar spectra later than K2 in predicting the correct helium triplet population. Importantly, since triplet helium inherits momentum from ionized helium as it is generated by recombination, it is significantly less prone to fractionation than ground-state neutral helium. However at separations of $\gtrsim 0.05$~au, ionization at the flow base and drag on helium weaken, leading to significant fractionation of the then mostly neutral helium. This in turn, can cause a suppression of the Helium transit depth, even though the helium line width remains large.

          New analysis of SNeIa Pantheon Catalog: Variable speed of light as an alternative to dark energy

 - **Abstract**
 In A&A 412, 35 (2003) Blanchard, Douspis, Rowan-Robinson, and Sarkar (BDRS) slightly modified the primordial fluctuation spectrum and produced an excellent fit to WMAP's CMB power spectrum for an Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) universe, bypassing dark energy. Curiously, they obtained a Hubble value of $H_0\approx46$, in sharp conflict with the canonical range $H_0\sim67-73$. However, we will demonstrate that the reduced value of $H_0\approx46$ achieved by BDRS is fully compatible with the use of variable speed of light in analyzing the late-time cosmic acceleration observed in Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa). In arXiv:2412.04257 [gr-qc] we uncovered a hidden aspect in a generic class of scale-invariant actions: the dynamics of the dilaton can induce a variation in the speed of light as $c\propto\chi^{1/2}$, causing $c$ to vary alongside $\chi$ across spacetime. For an EdS universe with varying $c$, besides the effects of cosmic expansion, light waves emitted from distant SNeIa are further subject to a refraction effect, which alters the Lemaitre redshift relation to $1+z=a^{-3/2}$. Based on this new formula, we achieve a fit to the SNeIa Pantheon Catalog exceeding the quality of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Crucially, our approach does not require dark energy and produces $H_0=47.2$ in strong alignment with the BDRS finding of $H_0\approx46$. Hence, BDRS's analysis of the (early-time) CMB power spectrum and our variable-$c$ analysis of the (late-time) Hubble diagram of SNeIa fully agree on two counts: (i) the dark energy hypothesis is avoided, and (ii) $H_0$ is reduced to $\sim47$, which also yields an age $t_0=2/(3H_0)=13.8$ Gy for an EdS universe, without requiring dark energy. Most importantly, we will demonstrate that the late-time acceleration can be attributed to the declining speed of light in an expanding EdS universe, rather than to a dark energy component.
