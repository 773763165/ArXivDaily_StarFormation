 - **Abstract**
 Numerical relativity simulations are crucial for studying black holes and have been instrumental in the detection of gravitational waves by the LVK. However, these simulations produce vast amounts of data that must be processed in order to perform studies, create models, and use them with gravitational wave detection pipelines. This paper introduces mayawaves, an open-source python library for processing, studying, and exporting numerical relativity simulations performed using the Einstein Toolkit and MAYA. Mayawaves streamlines the process of analyzing simulations with an intuitive interface, greatly reducing the learning curve for numerical relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper describes the overview of the FLASHING (Finest Legacy Acquisitions of SiO-/ H$_2$O-maser Ignitions by the Nobeyama Generation) project promoted using the 45 m telescope of Nobeyama Radio Observatory, which aims to intensively monitor H$_2$O (22 GHz) and SiO (43 GHz) masers associated with so-called "water fountain" sources. Here we show scientific results on the basis of the data taken in for the first five seasons of FLASHING, from 2018 December to 2023 April). We have found the evolution of the H$_2$O maser spectra, such as new spectral components breaking the record of the jet's top speed and/or systematic velocity drifts in the spectrum indicating acceleration or deceleration of the maser gas clumps. For the 43 GHz SiO maser emission, we have found its new detection in a source while its permanent disappearance in other source. Our finding may imply that the jets from these water fountains can be accelerated or decelerated, and show how cicumstellar envelopes have been destroyed.
#### Contrasting the Implicit Method in Incoherent Lagrangian and the  Correction Map Method in Hamiltonian

 - **Abstract**
 The equations of motion for a Lagrangian mainly refer to the acceleration equations, which can be obtained by the Euler--Lagrange equations. In the post-Newtonian Lagrangian form of general relativity, the Lagrangian systems can only maintain a certain post-Newtonian order and are incoherent Lagrangians since the higher-order terms are omitted. This truncation can cause some changes in the constant of motion. However, in celestial mechanics, Hamiltonians are more commonly used than Lagrangians. The conversion from Lagrangian to Hamiltonian can be achieved through the Legendre transformation. The coordinate momentum separable Hamiltonian can be computed by the symplectic algorithm, whereas the inseparable Hamiltonian can be used to compute the evolution of motion by the phase-space expansion method. Our recent work involves the design of a multi-factor correction map for the phase-space expansion method, known as the correction map method. In this paper, we compare the performance of the implicit algorithm in post-Newtonian Lagrangians and the correction map method in post-Newtonian Hamiltonians. Specifically, we investigate the extent to which both methods can uphold invariance of the motion's constants, such as energy conservation and angular momentum preservation. Ultimately, the results of numerical simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the correction map method, particularly with respect to angular momentum conservation.
#### Model Selection with Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations in the Lyman-alpha  Forest

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.00662
 - **Abstract**
 The recent release of the final, complete survey of Lyman-alpha baryonic acoustic oscillation measurements provides the most significant and accurate data base for studying cosmic geometry at an effective redshift z_eff=2.334, which is inaccessible to other sources. In this Letter, we use these data to select among four distinct cosmologies: Planck LCDM, the R_h=ct universe, the Milne universe and Einstein-de Sitter. Given the breadth and depth of the Lyman-alpha study, this BAO measurement alone provides a strong model comparison, complementary to previous studies that combined Lyman-$\alpha$ data with measurements at lower redshifts. Though both approaches are useful, the latter tends to dilute the disparity between model predictions and the observations. We therefore examine how the models compare to each other strictly based on the BAO scale measured in the Lyman-alpha forest and background quasars. We find that Milne and Einstein-de Sitter are strongly ruled out by these data. There is also strong evidence disfavoring the standard model. The Lyman-alpha measurements are completely consistent with the cosmic geometry predicted by R_h=ct. As such, evidence continues to grow that the zero active mass condition from general relativity ought to be an essential ingredient in LCDM.

 - **Abstract**
 Measurement of the largest angular scale ($\ell < 30$) features of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization is a powerful way to constrain the optical depth to reionization, $\tau$, and search for the signature of inflation through the detection of primordial $B$-modes. We present an analysis of maps covering nearly 75% of the sky made from the ground-based $40\,\mathrm{GHz}$ channel of the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) from August 2016 to May 2022. Using fast front-end polarization modulation from the Atacama Desert in Chile, we show this channel achieves higher sensitivity than the analogous frequencies from satellite measurements in the range $10 < \ell < 100$. After a final calibration adjustment, noise simulations show the CLASS linear (circular) polarization maps have a white noise level of $125 \,(130)\,\mathrm{\mu K\, arcmin}$. We measure the Galaxy-masked $EE$ and $BB$ spectra of diffuse synchrotron radiation and compare to space-based measurements at similar frequencies. In combination with external data, we expand measurements of the spatial variations of the synchrotron spectral energy density (SED) to include new regions of the sky and measure the faint diffuse SED in the harmonic domain. We place a new upper limit on a background of circular polarization in the range $5 < \ell < 125$ with the first bin showing $D_\ell < 0.023$ $\mathrm{\mu K^2_{CMB}}$ at 95% confidence. These results establish a new standard for recovery of the largest-scale CMB polarization from the ground and signal exciting possibilities when the higher sensitivity and higher frequency CLASS channels are included in the analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 We have selected 337 intermediate and high-mass YSOs ($1.5$ to $20$ M$_{\odot}$) well-characterised with spectroscopy. By means of the clustering algorithm HDBSCAN, we study their clustering and association properties in the Gaia DR3 catalogue as a function of stellar mass. We find that the lower mass YSOs ($1.5-4$ M$_{\odot}$) have clustering rates of $55-60\%$ in Gaia astrometric space, a percentage similar to the one found in the T Tauri regime. However, intermediate-mass YSOs in the range $4-10$ M$_{\odot}$ show a decreasing clustering rate with stellar mass, down to $27\%$. We find tentative evidence suggesting that massive YSOs ($>10$ M$_{\odot}$) often appear $-$yet not always$-$ clustered. We put forward the idea that most massive YSOs form via a mechanism that demands many low-mass stars around them. However, intermediate-mass YSOs form in a classical core-collapse T Tauri way, yet they do not appear often in the clusters around massive YSOs. We also find that intermediate and high-mass YSOs become less clustered with decreasing disk emission and accretion rate. This points towards an evolution with time. For those sources that appear clustered, no major correlation is found between their stellar properties and the cluster sizes, number of cluster members, cluster densities, or distance to cluster centres. In doing this analysis, we report the identification of 55 new clusters. We present tabulated all the derived cluster parameters for the considered intermediate and high-mass YSOs.
#### Scattered Disk Dynamics: The Mapping Approach

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.00684
 - **Abstract**
 We derive, and discuss the properties of, a symplectic map for the dynamics of bodies on nearly parabolic orbits. The orbits are perturbed by a planet on a circular, coplanar orbit interior to the pericenter of the parabolic orbit. The map shows excellent agreement with direct numerical integrations and elucidates how the dynamics depends on perturber mass and pericenter distance. We also use the map to explore the onset of chaos, statistical descriptions of chaotic transport, and sticking in mean-motion resonances. We discuss implications of our mapping model for the dynamical evolution of the solar system's scattered disk and other highly eccentric trans-Neptunian objects.

 - **Abstract**
 The Australian, Chinese, European, Indian, and North American pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations recently reported, at varying levels, evidence for the presence of a nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB). Given that each PTA made different choices in modeling their data, we perform a comparison of the GWB and individual pulsar noise parameters across the results reported from the PTAs that constitute the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). We show that despite making different modeling choices, there is no significant difference in the GWB parameters that are measured by the different PTAs, agreeing within $1\sigma$. The pulsar noise parameters are also consistent between different PTAs for the majority of the pulsars included in these analyses. We bridge the differences in modeling choices by adopting a standardized noise model for all pulsars and PTAs, finding that under this model there is a reduction in the tension in the pulsar noise parameters. As part of this reanalysis, we "extended" each PTA's data set by adding extra pulsars that were not timed by that PTA. Under these extensions, we find better constraints on the GWB amplitude and a higher signal-to-noise ratio for the Hellings and Downs correlations. These extensions serve as a prelude to the benefits offered by a full combination of data across all pulsars in the IPTA, i.e., the IPTA's Data Release 3, which will involve not just adding in additional pulsars, but also including data from all three PTAs where any given pulsar is timed by more than as single PTA.

 - **Abstract**
 The estimates of the delivery of icy planetesimals from the feeding zone of Proxima Centauri c (with mass equal to 7mE, mE is the mass of the Earth) to inner planets b and d were made. They included the studies of the total mass of planetesimals in the feeding zone of planet c and the probabilities of collisions of such planetesimals with inner planets. This total mass could be about 10-15mE. It was estimated based on studies of the ratio of the mass of planetesimals ejected into hyperbolic orbits to the mass of planetesimals collided with forming planet c. At integration of the motion of planetesimals, the gravitational influence of planets c and b and the star was taken into account. In most series of calculations, planetesimals collided with planets were excluded from integrations. Based on estimates of the mass of planetesimals ejected into hyperbolic orbits, it was concluded that during the growth of the mass of planet c the semi-major axis of its orbit could decrease by at least a factor of 1.5. Depending on possible gravitational scattering due to mutual encounters of planetesimals, the total mass of material delivered by planetesimals from the feeding zone of planet c to planet b was estimated to be between 0.002mE and 0.015mE. Probably, the amount of water delivered to Proxima Centauri b exceeded the mass of water in Earth's oceans. The amount of material delivered to planet d could be a little less than that delivered to planet b.

 - **Abstract**
 The Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) is a dedicated time-domain multi-band ($u$, $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$) photometric survey facility under construction. In this paper, we present a preliminary study that assesses the quality of photometric redshifts based on WFST by utilizing mock observations derived with the galaxy catalog in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field. We apply the template fitting technique to estimate photometric redshifts by using the ZEBRA photometric-redshift code and adopting a modified set of adaptive templates. We evaluate the bias (median relative offset between the output photometric redshifts and input redshifts), normalized median absolute deviation ($\sigma_{\rm NMAD}$) and outlier fraction ($f_{\rm outlier}$) of photometric redshifts in two typical WFST observational cases, the single 30-second exposure observations (hereafter shallow mode) and co-added 50-minute exposure observations (hereafter deep mode). We find bias$\la0.006$, $\sigma_{\rm NMAD}\la0.03$, and $f_{\rm outlier}\la5\%$ in the shallow mode and bias$\approx 0.005$, $\sigma_{\rm NMAD}\approx 0.06$, and $f_{\rm outlier}\approx 17\%$--$27\%$ in the deep mode, respectively, under various lunar phases. Combining the WFST mock observational data with that from the upcoming CSST and Euclid surveys, we demonstrate that the $z_{\rm phot}$ results can be significantly improved, with $f_{\rm outlier}\approx 1\%$ and $\sigma_{\rm NMAD}\approx 0.02$.
#### Migration processes in the Solar System and their role in the evolution  of the Earth and planets

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss problems of planetesimal migration in the emerging Solar System and exoplanetary systems. Protoplanetary disk evolution models and the formation of planets are considered. The formation of the Moon and of the asteroid and trans-Neptunian belts is studied. We show that Earth and Venus could acquire more than half of their mass in 5 million years, and their outer layers could accumulate the same material from different parts of the feeding zone of these planets. The migration of small bodies toward the terrestrial planets from various regions of the Solar System is simulated numerically. Based on these computations, we conclude that the mass of water delivered to the Earth by planetesimals, comets, and carbonaceous chondrite asteroids from beyond the ice line could be comparable to the mass of Earth's oceans. The processes of dust migration in the Solar System and sources of the zodiacal cloud are considered.

 - **Abstract**
 AXIS is a Probe-class mission concept that will provide high-throughput, high-spatial-resolution X-ray spectral imaging, enabling transformative studies of high-energy astrophysical phenomena. To take advantage of the advanced optics and avoid photon pile-up, the AXIS focal plane requires detectors with readout rates at least 20 times faster than previous soft X-ray imaging spectrometers flying aboard missions such as Chandra and Suzaku, while retaining the low noise, excellent spectral performance, and low power requirements of those instruments. We present the design of the AXIS high-speed X-ray camera, which baselines large-format MIT Lincoln Laboratory CCDs employing low-noise pJFET output amplifiers and a single-layer polysilicon gate structure that allows fast, low-power clocking. These detectors are combined with an integrated high-speed, low-noise ASIC readout chip from Stanford University that provides better performance than conventional discrete solutions at a fraction of their power consumption and footprint. Our complementary front-end electronics concept employs state of the art digital video waveform capture and advanced signal processing to deliver low noise at high speed. We review the current performance of this technology, highlighting recent improvements on prototype devices that achieve excellent noise characteristics at the required readout rate. We present measurements of the CCD spectral response across the AXIS energy band, augmenting lab measurements with detector simulations that help us understand sources of charge loss and evaluate the quality of the CCD backside passivation technique. We show that our technology is on a path that will meet our requirements and enable AXIS to achieve world-class science.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of a population of a large number ($\sim$400) of almost coeval (100--300 Myr) super star clusters (SSCs) in the disk of M82 offers an opportunity to construct the Cluster Initial Mass Function (CIMF) from the observed present-day Cluster Mass Function (CMF). We carry out the dynamical and photometric evolution of the CMF assuming the clusters move in circular orbits under the gravitational potential of the host galaxy using the semi-analytical simulation code EMACSS. We explore power-law and log-normal functions for the CIMFs, and populate the clusters in the disk assuming uniform, power-law, and exponential radial distribution functions. We find that the observed CMF is best produced by a CIMF that is power-law in form with an index of 1.8, for a power-law radial distribution function. More importantly, we establish that the observed turn-over in the present-day CMF is the result of observational incompleteness rather than due to dynamically induced effects, or an intrinsically log-normal CIMF, as was proposed for the fossil starburst region B of this galaxy. Our simulations naturally reproduce the mass-radius relation observed for a sub-sample of M82 SSCs.

 Looking to the future of exo-Earth imaging from the ground, core technology developments are required in visible extreme adaptive optics (ExAO) to enable the observation of atmospheric features such as oxygen on rocky planets in visible light. UNDERGROUND (Ultra-fast AO techNology Determination for Exoplanet imageRs from the GROUND), a collaboration built in Feb. 2023 at the Optimal Exoplanet Imagers Lorentz Workshop, aims to (1) motivate oxygen detection in Proxima Centauri b and analogs as an informative science case for high-contrast imaging and direct spectroscopy, (2) overview the state of the field with respect to visible exoplanet imagers, and (3) set the instrumental requirements to achieve this goal and identify what key technologies require further development.

 - **Abstract**
 As we look to the next generation of adaptive optics systems, now is the time to develop and explore the technologies that will allow us to image rocky Earth-like planets; wavefront control algorithms are not only a crucial component of these systems, but can benefit our adaptive optics systems without requiring increased detector speed and sensitivity or more effective and efficient deformable mirrors. To date, most observatories run the workhorse of their wavefront control as a classic integral controller, which estimates a correction from wavefront sensor residuals, and attempts to apply that correction as fast as possible in closed-loop. An integrator of this nature fails to address temporal lag errors that evolve over scales faster than the correction time, as well as vibrations or dynamic errors within the system that are not encapsulated in the wavefront sensor residuals; these errors impact high contrast imaging systems with complex coronagraphs. With the rise in popularity of machine learning, many are investigating applying modern machine learning methods to wavefront control. Furthermore, many linear implementations of machine learning methods (under varying aliases) have been in development for wavefront control for the last 30-odd years. With this work we define machine learning in its simplest terms, explore the most common machine learning methods applied in the context of this problem, and present a review of the literature concerning novel machine learning approaches to wavefront control.

 - **Abstract**
 We present updated atmospheric tables suitable for calculating the post-formation evolution and cooling of Jupiter and Jupiter-like exoplanets. These tables are generated using a 1D radiative transfer modeling code that incorporates the latest opacities and realistic prescriptions for stellar irradiation and ammonia clouds. To ensure the accuracy of our model parameters, we calibrate them against the measured temperature structure and geometric albedo spectrum of Jupiter, its effective temperature, and its inferred internal temperature. As a test case, we calculate the cooling history of Jupiter using an adiabatic and homogeneous interior and compare with extant models now used to evolve Jupiter and the giant planets. We find that our model reasonably matches Jupiter after evolving a hot-start initial condition to the present age of the solar system, with a discrepancy in brightness temperature/radius within two per cent. Our algorithm allows us to customize for different cloud, irradiation, and metallicity parameters. This class of boundary conditions can be used to study the evolution of solar-system giant planets and exoplanets with more complicated interior structures and non-adiabatic, inhomogeneous internal profiles.

 - **Abstract**
 The electron cyclotron maser instability (ECMI) of extraordinary mode waves was investigated with the parameters observed in Saturn's kilometric radiation (SKR) sources. Previous studies employed simplified dispersion relations, and did not consider the excitation of the relativistic (R) mode. This mode is introduced by considering the relativistic effect in plasmas consisting of both cold and hot electrons. Using particle-in-cell simulations, we investigated the excitation of R and X modes based on the measured data. Using the reported value of the density ratio of energetic to total electrons $n_e/n_0=24\%$, the most unstable mode is the R mode. The escaping X-mode emissions are amplified only if the energetic electrons are dominant with $n_e/n_0 \ge 90\%$. For these cases, only the X mode is excited and the R mode disappears due to its strong coupling. The results are well in line with the linear kinetic theory of ECMI. The properties of both the R and X modes are consistent with the observed SKR emissions. This raises questions about the nature of the measured electric field fluctuations within ``presumed'' SKR sources. The study provides new insights into the ECMI process relevant to SKR emission mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (MMA) has produced a wealth of data with much more to come in the future. This enormous data set will reveal new insights into the physics of Core Collapse SuperNovae (CCSN), Binary Neutron Star Mergers (BNSM), and many other objects where it is actually possible, if not probable, that new physics is in operation. To tease out different possibilities, we will need to analyze signals from photons, neutrinos, gravitational waves, and chemical elements. This task is made all the more difficult when it is necessary to evolve the neutrino component of the radiation field and associated quantum-mechanical property of flavor in order to model the astrophysical system of interest -- a numerical challenge that has not been addressed to this day. In this work, we take a step in this direction by adopting the technique of angular-integrated moments with a truncated tower of dynamical equations and a closure, convolving a flavor-transformation with spatial transport to evolve the neutrino radiation quantum field. We show that moments capture the dynamical features of Fast Flavor Instabilities (FFI) and provide comparable results to a more precise particle-in-cell method. We propose areas for improvement in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the evolution of photon injections with a power-law type spectrum inserted at various epochs of the universe, and obtain constraints on their parameter space from multiple different cosmological probes. Our work is motivated by the realistic possibility of having extended photon spectra from astrophysical and exotic sources. Going beyond a $\delta$-function like approximation, the physics becomes richer and the constraining power of cosmological probes starts to depend on the photon injection history in a complex way. As a toy model, we first consider a decaying particle scenario, and then generalize to a more model independent power law type injection in redshift. Different combinations of our parameters can be mapped to a wide variety of realistic astrophysical and exotic sources, providing useful benchmarks for study in future work.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper introduces a novel variability report generator developed for the Large Array Survey Telescope (LAST), a cost-effective multi-purpose telescope array conducting a wide survey of the variable sky in the visible-light spectrum. Designed to automate variability detection, the report generator identifies candidate variable stars by employing adjustable thresholds to detect periodic and non-periodic variables. The program outputs a visual and tabular photometric report for each candidate variable source from a given LAST sub-image. Functioning as a whitepaper, this document also provides a concise overview of LAST, discussing its design, data workflow, and variability search performance.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel method to quantify the assembly histories of dark matter halos with the redshift evolution of the mass-weighted spatial variance of their progenitor halos, i.e. the protohalo size history. We find that the protohalo size history for each individual halo at z~0 can be described by a double power-law function. The amplitude of the fitting function strongly correlates to the central-to-total stellar mass ratios of descendant halos. The variation of the amplitude of the protohalo size history can induce a strong halo assembly bias effect for massive halos. This effect is detectable in observation using the central-to-total stellar mass ratio as a proxy of the protohalo size. The correlation to the descendant central-to-total stellar mass ratio and the halo assembly bias effect seen in the protohalo size are much stronger than that seen in the commonly adopted half-mass formation time derived from the mass accretion history. This indicates that the information loss caused by the compression of halo merger trees to mass accretion histories can be captured by the protohalo size history. Protohalo size thus provides a useful quantity to connect protoclusters across cosmic time and to link protoclusters with their descendant clusters in observations.

 We present a comprehensive analysis of a Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) high-quality light curve for a young brown dwarf, MHO~4 having spectral type M7.0, in the Taurus star-forming region. We investigate the rotation periods and characterize the BD's dynamic atmosphere and surface features. We present light curve analysis of MHO~4, and estimate the rotation period to be around 2.224~d. Remarkably, MHO~4 exhibits two significant flaring events. Furthermore, we also estimated bolometric flare energies to be within the energy range of $10^{34}$ to $10^{35}$ erg, which sits in the superflare category.
#### Dynamical analysis of Maclaurin disk with velocity dispersion and its  influence on bar formation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.01091
 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the influence of Toomre's $Q$ parameter on the bar-forming dynamics of Maclaurin disk using $N$-body simulations. According to the Toomre's criterion, local velocity dispersion parametrized by $Q\geq 1$ is required to suppress the local axisymmetric instability but, in turn, it deviates particle orbits from nearly circular limit in which particle natural frequencies are calculated. We resolve this by including the effect of velocity dispersion, as the pressure potential, into the effective potential with the gravitational potential. With this formulation, circular orbit approximation is retrieved. The effective potential hypothesis can describe the $Q$-dependences of angular and epicyclic motions of the bar-forming processes and the established bars reasonably well provided that $Q\geq 1$. This indicates the influence of initial $Q$ that is imprinted in the entire disk dynamics, not only that $Q$ serves as the stability indicator. In addition, we perform the stability test for the disk-in-halo systems. With the presence of halo, disks are more susceptible to the bar formation as seen by the elevated critical $Q$ than that for the isolated disk. This is attributed to the differential rotation that builds the unstable non-axisymmetric spiral modes more efficiently which are the ingredients of bar instability.

 - **Abstract**
 Using a set of high-resolution N-body simulations, we extend the unified distribution model of cold dark matter (CDM) subhaloes to the warm dark matter(WDM) case. The same model framework combining the unevolved mass function, unevolved radial distribution, and tidal stripping can predict the mass function and spatial distribution of subhaloes in both CDM and WDM simulations. The dependence of the model on the DM particle property is universally parameterized through the half-mode mass of the initial power spectrum. Compared with the CDM model, the WDM model differs most notably in two aspects. 1) In contrast to the power-law form in CDM, the unevolved subhalo mass function for WDM is scale-dependent at the low mass end due to the cut-off in the initial power spectrum. 2) WDM subhaloes are more vulnerable to tidal stripping and disruption due to their lower concentrations at accretion time. Their survival rate is also found to depend on the infall mass. Accounting for these differences, the model predicts a final WDM subhalo mass function that is also proportional to the unevolved subhalo mass function. The radial distribution of WDM subhaloes is predicted to be mass-dependent. For low mass subhaloes, the radial distribution is flatter in the inner halo and steeper in the outer halo compared to the CDM counterpart, due to the scale-dependent unevolved mass function and the enhanced tidal stripping. The code for sampling subhaloes according to our generalized model is available at https://github.com/fhtouma/subgen2 .
#### Face-on Map of the Molecular Disc and 3-kpc Expanding Ring of the Galaxy  based on a High-Accuracy Rotation Curve

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the longitude-velocity diagram (LVD) of the CO-line emission from archival data and use the most accurate rotation curve (RC) of the Milky Way to transform radial velocity to face-on position in the Galactic plane. We point out that the face-on transformation is highly sensitive to the adopted RC, especially in the inner Milky Way, in the sense that deviations of the RC from the true rotation velocity yield an artifact hole or overcrowded concentration along the tangent circle for over- or under-estimated RC. Even if the RC is sufficiently accurate, non-circular motion such as with the 3 kpc expanding ring causes significant artifacts in the resulting face-on-map as long as a circular rotation is assumed. On the other hand, if we properly take into account the non-circular motion, it can be used to solve the near-far degeneracy problem of determination of kinematic distance. We thus propose a new method to solve the degeneracy by incorporating the expanding motion of a ring or arms. We apply the method to the LVD of the 3-kpc expanding ring and present its face-on map projected onto the galactic plane for the first time.

 - **Abstract**
 Many modern millimeter and submillimeter (``mm-wave'') telescopes for astronomy are deploying more detectors by increasing detector pixel density, and with the rise of lithographed detector architectures and high-throughput readout techniques, it is becoming increasingly practical to overfill the focal plane. However, when the pixel pitch $p_{\rm pix}$ is small compared to the product of the wavelength $\lambda$ and the focal ratio $F$, or $p_{\mathrm{pix}} \lesssim 1.2 F \lambda$, the Bose term of the photon noise correlates between neighboring detector pixels due to the Hanbury Brown & Twiss (HBT) effect. When this HBT effect is non-negligible, the array-averaged sensitivity scales with detector count $N_{\mathrm{det}}$ less favorably than the uncorrelated limit of $N_{\mathrm{det}}^{-1/2}$. In this paper, we present a general prescription to calculate this HBT correlation based on a quantum optics formalism and extend it to polarization-sensitive detectors. We then estimate the impact of HBT correlations on the sensitivity of a model mm-wave telescope and discuss the implications for focal-plane design.

 - **Abstract**
 Kilonova spectra provide us with information of r-process nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers. However, it is still challenging to identify individual elements in the spectra mainly due to lack of experimentally accurate atomic data for heavy elements in the near-infrared wavelengths. Recently, Domoto et al. (2022) proposed the absorption features around 14500 A in the observed spectra of GW170817/AT2017gfo as Ce III lines. But they used theoretical transition probabilities (gf-values) whose accuracy is uncertain. In this paper, we derive the astrophysical gf-values of the three Ce III lines, aiming at verification of this identification. We model high resolution H-band spectra of four F-type supergiants showing the clear Ce III absorption features by assuming stellar parameters derived from optical spectra in literatures. We also test the validity of the derived astrophysical gf-values by estimating Ce III abundances in Ap stars. We find that the derived astrophysical gf-values of the Ce III lines are systematically lower by about 0.25 dex than those used in previous work of kilonovae, while they are still compatible within the uncertainty range. By performing radiative transfer simulations of kilonovae with the derived gf-values, we find that the identification of Ce III as a source of the absorption features in the observed kilonova spectra still stands, even considering the uncertainties in the astrophysical gf-values. This supports identification of Ce in the spectra of GW170817/AT2017gfo.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) as a remarkable candidate for Dark Matter (DM) content of the universe have attracted a lot of interests from the scientific community. So, in this study generation of PBHs from Higgs potential in the presence of a tiny bump in non-canonical inflationary model has been inquired. It is demonstrated that, a viable inflationary era can be driven through the Higgs potential with self coupling constant $\lambda=0.13$, in non-canonical framework with a power-law Lagrangian density. Furthermore, setting a suitable function of inflaton field as a correction term (like a bump) to the Higgs potential, causes the inflaton to slow down for a while. In such a short time span, the amplitude of the scalar perturbations power spectrum on small scales grows up sufficiently versus CMB scales. In addition to the bump feature, the enhancing effect of the $\alpha$ parameter of the Lagrangian on the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum has been shown. Fine tuning of three parameter Cases of our model, gives rise to generate three Cases of PBHs with masses ${\cal O}(10)M_{\odot}$, ${\cal O}(10^{-6})M_{\odot}$ and ${\cal O}(10^{-13})M_{\odot}$, which can be appropriate to expound LIGO-VIRGO events, microlensing events in OGLE data and nearly the entirety of DM content, respectively. Generation of these PBHs accompanies by propagating of secondary Gravitational Waves (GWs). It is illustrated that, the contemporary density parameter spectra $(\Omega_{\rm GW_0})$ of these GWs can be tracked down by GWs detectors. Lastly, a power-law behavior for the spectra of $\Omega_{\rm GW_0}$ with regard to frequency has been pointed out. The power index in the infrared domain has the log-reliant form as $n=3-2/\ln(f_c/f)$.
#### The science of ultra-high energy cosmic rays after more than 15 years of  operation of the Pierre Auger Observatory

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) have been studied with the data of the Pierre Auger Observatory for more than fifteen years. An essential feature of the Observatory is its hybrid design: UHECRs are detected through the observation of the associated extensive air showers (EASs) with different and complementary techniques. The analyses of the multi-detector data have enabled high-statistics and high-precision studies of the UHECR energy spectrum, mass composition and distribution of arrival directions. The resulting science of UHECRs is summarized in this contribution. While no discrete source of UHECRs has been identified so far, the extragalactic origin of the particles has been recently confirmed from the arrival directions above 8~EeV, and the ring is closing around nearby astrophysical sites at higher energies. Also, the established upper limits on fluxes of UHE neutrinos and photons have implications on multi-messenger studies and beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) physics.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the previous microlensing data collected by the KMTNet survey in search of anomalous events for which no precise interpretations of the anomalies have been suggested. From this investigation, we find that the anomaly in the lensing light curve of the event KMT-2021-BLG-1547 is approximately described by a binary-lens (2L1S) model with a lens possessing a giant planet, but the model leaves unexplained residuals. We investigate the origin of the residuals by testing more sophisticated models that include either an extra lens component (3L1S model) or an extra source star (2L2S model) to the 2L1S configuration of the lens system. From these analyses, we find that the residuals from the 2L1S model originate from the existence of a faint companion to the source. The 2L2S solution substantially reduces the residuals and improves the model fit by $\Delta\chi^2=67.1$ with respect to the 2L1S solution. The 3L1S solution also improves the fit, but its fit is worse than that of the 2L2S solution by $\Delta\chi^2=24.7$. According to the 2L2S solution, the lens of the event is a planetary system with planet and host masses $(M_{\rm p}/M_{\rm J}, M_{\rm h}/M_\odot)=\left( 1.47^{+0.64}_{-0.77}, 0.72^{+0.32}_{-0.38}\right)$ lying at a distance $\D_{\rm L} =5.07^{+0.98}_{-1.50}$~kpc, and the source is a binary composed of a subgiant primary of a late G or an early K spectral type and a main-sequence companion of a K spectral type. The event demonstrates the need of sophisticated modeling for unexplained anomalies for the construction of a complete microlensing planet sample.

 - **Abstract**
 GRB 220101A is the most distant gamma-ray burst detected by the Fermi-LAT to date, at a redshift z = 4.618. It is also a very energetic event, with an equivalent isotropic energy of $3.6\times10^{54}$ erg. We jointly analyzed the Fermi/GBM and LAT observations of GRB 220101A with two independent approaches, and found a significant spectral break at sub-100 MeV energies during the prompt emission. The fast variability of the emission suggests that this spectral attenuation is caused by internal opacity to pair creation. Regardless of the nature of the emission processes assumed in the spectral analysis, we infer a moderate value for the jet Lorentz factor, $\Gamma\sim110$, and find that all of the high-energy emission was produced above and near the photosphere, at a distance of $\sim10^{14}$ cm from the central engine. We compare these results with the four other LAT-detected gamma-ray bursts with similar properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Combining cosmological probes has consolidated the standard cosmological model with percent precision, but some tensions have recently emerged when certain parameters are estimated from the local or primordial Universe. Whether this is due to hidden systematics or it points towards new physics is still under debate, however, it is crucial to study as many probes as possible to cross-check the results with independent methods and provide additional pieces of information to the cosmological puzzle. In this work, by combining several late-Universe probes sampling the redshift range $0<z<10$, namely, Type Ia SuperNovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Cosmic Chronometers and Gamma-Ray Bursts, we aim to derive cosmological constraints independently of local or early-Universe anchors. To test the standard cosmological model and its various extensions, considering an evolving Dark Energy Equation of State and the curvature as a free parameter, we analyse each probe individually and all their possible permutations. Assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, the full combination of probes provides $H_0=67.2^{+3.4}_{-3.2}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $\Omega_m=0.325\pm0.015$ ($68\%$ C.L.). Considering a flat $w$CDM model, we measure $w_0=-0.91^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$ ($68\%$ C.L.), while by relaxing the flatness assumption ($\Lambda$CDM model, $95\%$ C.L.) we obtain $\Omega_k=0.125^{+0.167}_{-0.165}$. Finally, we analytically characterize the degeneracy directions and the relative orientation of the probes' contours. By calculating the Figure--of--Merit, we quantify the synergies among independent methods, estimate the constraining power of each probe and identify which provides the best contribution to the inference process. Pending the new cosmological surveys, this study confirms the exigency for new emerging cosmological probes in the landscape of modern cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars with initial masses in the range of 8-25 solar masses are thought to end their lives as hydrogen-rich supernova (SNe II). Based on the pre-explosion images of Hubble Space Telescope (\textit{HST}) and \textit{Spitzer} Space Telescope, we place tight constraints on the progenitor candidate of type IIP SN 2023ixf in Messier 101. Fitting of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of its progenitor with dusty stellar spectral models results in an estimation of the effective temperature as 3090 K, making it the coolest SN progenitor ever discovered. The luminosity is estimated as log($L/$L$_{\odot}$)$\sim4.8$, consistent with a red supergiant (RSG) star with an initial mass of 12$^{+2}_{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$. The derived mass loss rate (6-9$\times10^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) is much lower than that inferred from the flash spectroscopy of the SN, suggesting that the progenitor experienced a sudden increase in mass loss when approaching the final explosion. In the mid-infrared color diagram, the progenitor star is found to show a significant deviation from the range of regular RSGs, but is close to some extreme RSGs and super asymptotic giant branch (sAGB) stars. Thus, SN 2023ixf may belong to a rare subclass of electron-captured supernova for an origin of sAGB progenitor.

 - **Abstract**
 The non-local thermodynamical equilibrium (NLTE) line formation of Y I and Y II is considered in 1D LTE model atmospheres of F-G-K-type stars. The model atom was constructed with the most up-to-date atomic data, including quantum cross sections and rate coefficients for transitions in inelastic collisions of Y I and Y II with hydrogen atoms. For seven reference stars, we obtained an agreement between NLTE abundances inferred from the two ionization stages, while the difference in LTE abundance (Y I - Y II) can reach up to -0.31 dex. In the atmospheres of F-G-K-type stars, for both Y I and Y II lines, the NLTE abundance corrections are positive. In solar metallicity stars, the NLTE abundance corrections for Y II lines do not exceed 0.12 dex, while in atmospheres of metal-poor stars they do not exceed 0.21 dex. For Y I lines, the NLTE abundance corrections can reach up to 0.5 dex. We determined the yttrium NLTE abundances for a sample of 65 F and G dwarfs and subgiants in the -2.62~$\leq$~[Fe/H]~$\leq$~+0.24 metallicity range, using high-resolution spectra. For stars with [Fe/H]~$\leq$~-1.5, [Y/Fe] versus [Fe/H] diagram reveals positive trend with an average value of [Y/Fe]~$\simeq$~0. For metal-poor stars, among Sr, Y, and Zr, the arrangement [Sr/Fe] < [Y/Fe] < [Zr/Fe] remains consistent. The current study is useful for the Galactic chemical evolution research. The model atom will be applied for NLTE yttrium abundance determination in very metal-poor stars studied with LAMOST and Subaru.

 - **Abstract**
 For the past several decades, numerous attempts have been made to model the climate of Mars with extensive studies focusing on the planet's dynamics and the understanding of its climate. While physical modeling and data assimilation approaches have made significant progress, uncertainties persist in comprehensively capturing and modeling the complexities of Martian climate. In this work, we propose a novel approach to Martian climate modeling by leveraging machine learning techniques that have shown remarkable success in Earth climate modeling. Our study presents a deep neural network designed to accurately model relative humidity in Gale Crater, as measured by NASA's Mars Science Laboratory ``Curiosity'' rover. By utilizing simulated meteorological variables produced by the Mars Planetary Climate Model, a robust Global Circulation Model, our model accurately predicts relative humidity with a mean error of 3\% and an $R^2$ score of 0.92. Furthermore, we present an approach to predict quantile ranges of relative humidity, catering to applications that require a range of values. To address the challenge of interpretability associated with machine learning models, we utilize an interpretable model architecture and conduct an in-depth analysis of its internal mechanisms and decision making processes. We find that our neural network can effectively model relative humidity at Gale crater using a few meteorological variables, with the monthly mean surface H$_2$O layer, planetary boundary layer height, convective wind speed, and solar zenith angle being the primary contributors to the model predictions. In addition to providing a fast and efficient method to modeling climate variables on Mars, this modeling approach can also be used to expand on current datasets by filling spatial and temporal gaps in observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The challenges inherent to time-domain multi-messenger astronomy require strategic actions so that adapted, optimized follow-up observations are performed efficiently. In particular, poorly localized events require dedicated tiling and/or targeted, follow-up campaigns so that the region in which the source really is can be efficiently covered, increasing the chances to detect the multi-wavelength counterpart. We have developed the python package "tilepy" to rapidly derive the observation scheduling of large uncertainty localization events by small/mid-FoV instruments. We will describe several mature follow-up scheduling strategies. These range from an option to use of low-resolution grids, to the full integration of sky regions and targeted observations using galaxy catalogs. The algorithms consider the visibility constraints of customisable observatories and allow to schedule observations in both astronomical darkness and in moonlight conditions. Developed initially to provide a rapid response to gravitational wave (GW) alerts by Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), they have been proven successful, as shown by the GW follow-up during O2 and O3 with the H.E.S.S. telescopes, and particularly in the follow-up of GW170817, the first binary neutron star (BNS) merger ever detected. Here we will present a generalisation of these rapid strategies to other alerts showing large uncertainties in the localization, like Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) alerts from Fermi-GBM. We will also demonstrate the flexibility of {\it tilepy} in scheduling observations for a large variety of observatories. We will conclude by describing the latest developments of these algorithms that are able to derive optimised follow-up schedules across multiple observatories and networks of telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 We used high resolution spectra acquired at the Magellan Telescope to measure radial and rotational velocities of approximately 200 stars in the Galactic globular cluster NGC 3201. The surveyed sample includes Blue Stragglers Stars (BSSs) and reference stars in different evolutionary stages (main sequence turn-off, sub-giant, red giant and asymptotic giant branches). The average radial velocity value ($\langle V_r\rangle = 494.5 \pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$) confirms a large systemic velocity for this cluster and was used to distinguish 33 residual field interlopers. The final sample of member stars counts 67 BSSs and 114 reference stars. Similarly to what is found in other clusters, the totality of the reference stars has negligible rotation ($<20$ km s$^{-1}$), while the BSS rotational velocity distribution shows a long tail extending up to $\sim 200$ km s$^{-1}$, with 19 BSSs (out of 67) spinning faster than 40 km s$^{-1}$. This sets the percentage of fast rotating BSSs to $\sim 28\%$. Such a percentage is roughly comparable to that measured in other loose systems ($\omega$ Centauri, M4 and M55) and significantly larger than that measured in high-density clusters (as 47 Tucanae, NGC 6397, NGC 6752 and M30). This evidence supports a scenario where recent BSS formation (mainly from the evolution of binary systems) is occurring in low-density environments. We also find that the BSS rotational velocity tends to decrease for decreasing luminosity and surface temperature, similarly to what is observed in main sequence stars. Hence, further investigations are needed to understand the impact of BSS internal structure on the observed rotational velocities.

 - **Abstract**
 Neptune-sized planets exhibit a wide range of compositions and densities, depending onf cators related to their formation and evolution history, such as the distance from their host stars and atmospheric escape processes. They can vary from relatively low-density planets with thick hydrogen-helium atmospheres to higher-density planets with a substantial amount of water or a rocky interior with a thinner atmosphere, such as HD 95338 b, TOI-849 b and TOI-2196 b. The discovery of exoplanets in the hot-Neptune desert, a region close to the host stars with a deficit of Neptune-sized planets, provides insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems, including the existence of this region itself. Here we show observations of the transiting planet TOI-1853 b, which has a radius of 3.46 +- 0.08 Earth radii and orbits a dwarf star every 1.24 days. This planet has a mass of 73.2 +- 2.7 Earth masses, almost twice that of any other Neptune-sized planet known so far, and a density of 9.7 +- 0.8 grams per cubic centimetre. These values place TOI-1853 b in the middle of the Neptunian desert and imply that heavy elements dominate its mass. The properties of TOI-1853 b present a puzzle for conventional theories of planetary formation and evolution, and could be the result of several proto-planet collisions or the final state of an initially high-eccentricity planet that migrated closer to its parent star.

 - **Abstract**
 To overcome the high optical extinction, near-infrared observations are needed for probing the microlensing events toward the Galactic center. The 2015-2019 UKIRT microlensing survey toward the Galactic center is the first dedicated precursor near-infrared (NIR) survey for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. We here analyze the online data from the UKIRT microlensing survey, reaching $l=b=0^\circ$. Using the event-finder algorithm of KMTNet with the $\Delta \chi^2$ threshold of 250, we find 522 clear events, 436 possible events, and 27 possible anomalous events. We fit a point-source point-lens (PSPL) model to all the clear events and derive the PSPL parameters with uncertainties using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Assuming perfect detection efficiency, we compute the uncorrected event rates, which should serve as the lower limits on the true event rate. We find that the uncorrected NIR event rates are likely rising toward the Galactic center and higher than the optical event rates.

 - **Abstract**
 Since their discoveries in 1967, Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) continue to be one of the most researched objects in astrophysics. Multi-messenger observations are key to gaining a deeper understanding of these events. In order to facilitate such measurements, fast and accurate localization of the gamma-ray prompt emission is required. As traditional localization techniques are often time consuming or prone to significant systematic errors, here we present a novel method which can be applied on the POLAR-2 observatory. POLAR-2 is a dedicated GRB polarimeter, which will be launched towards the China Space Station (CSS) in 2025. The CSS provides POLAR-2 access to a GPU, which makes it possible and advantageous to run a Deep Learning model on it. In this work, we explore the possibility to identify GRBs in real time and to infer their location and spectra with deep learning models. Using POLAR simulations and data, a feasibility experiment was performed to implement this method on POLAR-2. Our results indicate that using this method, in combination with real time data downlinking capabilities, POLAR-2 will be able to provide accurate localization alerts within 2 minutes of the GRB onset.
#### Unique chemical composition of the very metal-poor star LAMOST  J1645+4357

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the chemical composition of the very metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-2.9) star LAMOST J1645+4357 that is identified to be a red giant having peculiar abundance ratios by Li et al. (2022). The standard abundance analysis is carried out for this object and the well studied metal-poor star HD~122563 that has similar atmospheric parameters. LAMOST J1645+4357 has a remarkable abundance set, highlighted by these features: (1) Nitrogen is significantly enhanced ([N/Fe]=+1.4) and the total abundance of C and N is also very high ([(C+N)/Fe]=+0.9); (2) alpha-elements are over-abundant with respect to iron as generally found in very metal-poor stars; (3) Ti, Sc, Co and Zn are significantly deficient; (4) Cr and Mn are enhanced compared to most of very metal-poor stars; (5) Sr and Ba are deficient and the Sr/Ba ratio ([Sr/Ba]=-1.0) is significantly lower than the value expected for the r-process. The overall abundance pattern of this object from C to Zn is well reproduced by a faint supernova model assuming spherical explosion, except for the excess of Cr and Mn which requires enhancement of incomplete Si burning or small contributions of a type Ia supernova or a pair-instability supernova. There remains, however, a question why the abundance pattern of this star is so unique among very metal-poor stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Proto-neutron stars (PNS) are born hot, with temperatures exceeding a few times $10^{10}$ K. In these conditions, the PNS crust is expected to be made of a Coulomb liquid composed of an ensemble of different nuclear species. We perform a study of the beta-equilibrated PNS crust in the liquid phase in a self-consistent multi-component plasma (MCP) approach, thus allowing us to consistently calculate the impurity parameter, often taken as a free parameter in cooling simulations. We developed a self-consistent MCP approach at finite temperature using a compressible liquid-drop description of the ions, with surface parameters adjusted to reproduce experimental masses. The treatment of the ion centre-of-mass motion was included through a translational free-energy term accounting for in-medium effects. The results of self-consistent MCP calculations are systematically compared with those performed in a perturbative and in the one-component plasma treatment. We show that the inclusion of non-linear mixing terms arising from the ion centre-of-mass motion leads to a breakdown of the ensemble equivalence between the one-component and MCP approach. Our findings illustrate that the abundance of light nuclei becomes important, eventually dominating the distribution at higher density and temperature. This is reflected in the impurity parameter, which, in turn, may have a potential impact on NS cooling. For practical applications, we also provide a fitting formula for the impurity parameter in the PNS inner crust. Our results obtained within a self-consistent MCP approach show important differences in the prediction of the PNS composition with respect to those obtained with a one-component or a perturbative MCP approximation, particularly in the deeper region of the crust. This highlights the importance of a full, self-consistent MCP calculation for reliable predictions of the PNS crust composition.
#### A universal average spectral energy distribution for quasars from  optical to extreme ultraviolet

 - **Abstract**
 The well-known anti-correlation between the optical/ultraviolet (UV) emission line equivalent widths of active galactic nuclei and the continuum luminosity (the so-called Baldwin effect) is a long-standing puzzle. One common hypothesis is that more luminous sources have softer spectral energy distribution (SED) in the extreme UV (EUV), as revealed by some observational studies. In this work we revisit this issue through cross-matching SDSS quasars with GALEX far-UV/near-UV catalogs and correcting the effect of a severe observational bias of significant UV detection incompleteness, i.e., the more luminous in observed-frame optical, the more likely detected in observed-frame UV. We find that, for GALEX detected quasars at 1.8 < z < 2.2, the rest-frame mean UV SED (~ 500 -- 3000 Angstrom) bewilderingly shows no luminosity dependence at log(\nu L_\nu(2200 Angstrom)) > 45 (up to 47.3), contrary to the standard thin disc model predictions and the observed Baldwin effect in this luminosity range. Probably, the universal mean UV SED is the result of a local atomic-originated process, and in fainter quasars stronger disk turbulence launching more clouds is the main origin of the Baldwin effect. After correcting for the absorption of the intergalactic medium, a rest-frame intrinsic mean EUV SED is derived from a sub-sample of bright quasars and is found to be much redder in the EUV than all previous quasar composite spectra, highlighting the significance of properly accounting for the sample incompleteness. Interestingly, the global consistence between our extremely red mean EUV SED and the line-driven wind model again supports an origin of a local physical process.

 - **Abstract**
 Ammonia is one of the most widely observed molecules in space, and many observations are able to resolve the hyperfine structure due to the electric quadrupole moment of the nitrogen nucleus. The observed spectra often display anomalies in the satellite components of the lines, which indicate substantial deviations from the local thermodynamic equilibrium. The interpretation of the spectra thus requires the knowledge of the rate coefficients for the hyperfine excitation of NH$_3$ induced by collisions with H$_2$ molecules, the dominant collider in the cold interstellar medium. In this paper we present the first such calculations using a recoupling approach. The rate coefficients are obtained for all hyperfine levels within rotation-inversion levels up to $j=4$ and temperatures up to 100 K by means of quantum scattering close-coupling calculations on an accurate, five-dimensional, potential energy surface. We show that the rate coefficients depart significantly from those obtained with the statistical approach and that they do not conform to any simple propensity rules. Finally, we perform radiative transfer calculations to illustrate the impact of our new rate coefficients by modelling the hyperfine line intensities of the inversion transition in ground state para-NH$_3$ ($j_k=1_1$) and of the rotational transition $1_0\rightarrow 0_0$ in ortho-NH$_3$.
#### On the evolution of a stellar system in the context of the virial  equation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.01544
 - **Abstract**
 The virial equation is used to clarify the nature of the dynamic evolution of a stellar system. Compared to the kinetic equation, it gives a deeper but incomplete description of the process of relaxation to a quasi-stationary state, which here means the fulfillment of the virial theorem. Analysis shows that the time to reach the virial equlibrium state $T_v$ is about two to three dozen dynamic time periods $T_d$. Namely, during $T_v$ the virial ratio, the mean harmonic radius, and the root-mean-square radius of the system fluctuate, and then the first two characteristics stabilize near their equilibrium values, while the root-mean-square radius continues to grow (possibly ad infinitum). This indicates a fundamentally different behavior of the moment of inertia of the system relative to the center of gravity and its potential energy, leading to the formation of a relatively small equilibrium core and an extended halo.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a line-by-line differential analysis of a sample of 125 co-moving pairs of stars (dwarfs and subgiants near solar metallicity). We obtain high precision stellar parameters with average uncertainties in effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity of 16.5 K, 0.033 dex and 0.014 dex, respectively. We classify the co-moving pairs of stars into two groups, chemically homogeneous (conatal; |Delta[Fe/H]| $\le$ 0.04 dex) and inhomogeneous (non-conatal), and examine the fraction of chemically homogeneous pairs as a function of separation and effective temperature. The four main conclusions from this study are: (1) A spatial separation of \ds = 10$^6$ AU is an approximate boundary between homogeneous and inhomogeneous pairs of stars, and we restrict our conclusions to only consider the 91 pairs with \ds $\le$ 10$^6$ AU; (2) There is no trend between velocity separation and the fraction of chemically homogeneous pairs in the range \dv $\le$ 4 \kms; (3) We confirm that the fraction of chemically inhomogeneous pairs increases with increasing \teff\ and the trend matches a toy model of that expected from planet ingestion; (4) Atomic diffusion is not the main cause of the chemical inhomogeneity. A major outcome from this study is a sample of 56 bright co-moving pairs of stars with chemical abundance differences $\leq$ 0.02 dex (5\%) which is a level of chemical homogeneity comparable to that of the Hyades open cluster. These important objects can be used, in conjunction with star clusters and the \gaia\ ``benchmark'' stars, to calibrate stellar abundances from large-scale spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Our previous investigation of neutron-star crusts, based on the functional BSk24, led to a substantial reduction of the pasta mantle when Strutinsky integral and pairing corrections were added on top of the fourth-order extended Thomas-Fermi method (ETF). Here, our earlier calculations are widened to a larger set of functionals within the same family, and we find that the microscopic corrections weaken significantly the influence of the symmetry energy. In particular, the correlation observed at the pure ETF level between the density for the onset of pasta formation and the symmetry energy vanishes, not only for the $L$ coefficient but also for the symmetry-energy values at the relevant densities. Moreover, the inclusion of microscopic corrections results in a much lower abundance of pasta for all functionals.
#### A fresh perspective on the 3-D dynamics of Tycho's supernova remnant:  ejecta asymmetries in X-rays

 - **Abstract**
 450 years after the explosion of the Type Ia SN1572, the dynamics of the Tycho supernova remnant can give us keys to understand the explosion mechanism and the interaction of the remnant with the interstellar medium. To probe the asymmetries and the evolution of the SNR, we track the ejecta dynamics using new methods applied to the deep X-ray observations available in the Chandra space telescope archive. For the line of sight velocity measurement Vz, we use the Doppler effect focused on the bright Si line in the 1.6-2.1 keV band. Using the component separation tool General Morphological Component Analysis (GMCA), we successfully disentangle the red and blueshifted Si ejecta emission. This allows us to reconstruct a map of the peak energy of the Si line with a total coverage of the SNR at a 2'' resolution and a proxy of the velocity in the line of sight. For the proper motions in the plane of the sky Vxy, we develop a new method, named Poisson Optical Flow, to measure the displacement of 2D features between the observations of 2003 and 2009. The result is a field of 1700 velocity vectors covering the entire SNR. These exhaustive 3D velocity measurements reveal the complex and patchy dynamics of the SNR. At the large-scale, an asymmetry with the North being dominantly blueshifted and the South redshifted is observed. The proper motion vector field Vxy highlights different dynamics between the East and the West parts of the SNR. The eastern velocity field is more disturbed by external inhomogeneities and the South-East ejecta knot. In particular, a slow-down is observed in the North-East which could be due to the interaction with higher densities as seen in other wavelengths. The vector field is also used to backtrace the center of the explosion which is then compared with potential stellar progenitors distances from the latest Gaia DR3, leaving only stars B and E as possible candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate a cosmological model involving a negative cosmological constant (AdS vacua in the dark energy sector). We consider a quintessence field on top of a negative cosmological constant and study its impact on cosmological evolution and structure formation. We use the power spectrum of the redshifted HI 21 cm brightness temperature maps from the post-reionization epoch as a cosmological probe. The signature of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) on the multipoles of the power spectrum is used to extract measurements of the angular diameter distance $D_A(z)$ and the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. The projected errors on these are then subsequently employed to forecast the constraints on the model parameters ($\Omega_\Lambda, w_0, w_a$) using Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. We find that a negative cosmological constant with a phantom dark energy equation of state (EoS) and a higher value of $H_0$ is viable from BAO distance measurements data derived from galaxy samples. We also find that BAO imprints on the 21cm power spectrum obtained from a futuristic SKA-mid like experiment yield a $1-\sigma$ error on a negative cosmological constant and the quintessence dark energy EoS parameters to be $\Omega_\Lambda=-0.883^{0.978}_{-2.987} $ and $w_0=-1.030^{0.023}_{-0.082}$, $w_a=-0.088^{0.162}_{-0.343}$ respectively, which is competitive with other probes reported in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of four triply eclipsing triple star systems, namely TIC 88206187, TIC 14839347, TIC 298714297, and TIC 66893949. The four systems with third-body eclipses were found in the TESS lightcurves from among a sample of ~400 matches between known eclipsing binaries and the Gaia DR3 Non-Single Star (NSS; Gaia Collaboration 2022; Pourbaix et al. 2022) solution database. We combined photometric lightcurves, eclipse timing variations, archival spectral energy distributions, and theoretical evolution tracks in a robust photodynamical analysis to determine the orbital and system parameters. The triples have outer periods of 52.9, 85.5, 117, and 471 days, respectively. All dozen stars have masses $\lesssim$ 2.6 M$_\odot$. The systems are quite flat with mutual inclination angles between the inner and outer orbital planes that are all $\lesssim 4^\circ$. The outer mass ratios range from 0.39--0.76, consistent with our earlier collection of compact triply eclipsing triples. TIC 88206187 exhibits a fractional radius of the outer tertiary component $(r_B \equiv R_B/a_{\rm out})$ exceeding 0.1 (only the third such system known), and we consider its future evolution. Finally, we compare our photodynamical analysis results and the orbital parameters given in the Gaia DR3 NSS solutions, indicating decent agreement, but with the photodynamical results being more accurate.

 - **Abstract**
 Significant evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave background has recently been reported by several Pulsar Timing Array observations. These studies have shown that, in addition to astrophysical explanations based on supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), cosmological origins are considered equally important sources for these signals. To further explore these cosmological sources, in this study, we discuss the anisotropies in the cosmological gravitational wave background (CGWB) in a model-independent way. Taking the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) 15-year dataset as a benchmark, we estimate the angular power spectra of the CGWB and their cross-correlations with cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations and weak gravitational lensing. We find that the NANOGrav 15-year data implies suppressed Sachs-Wolf (SW) effects in the CGBW spectrum, leading to a marginally negative cross-correlation with the CMB at large scales. This procedure is applicable to signals introduced by different early universe processes and is potentially useful for identifying unique features about anisotropies of CGWB from future space-based interferometers and astrometric measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 The space sector is experiencing a flourishing growth and evidence is mounting that the near future will be characterized by a large amount of deep-space missions. In the last decade, CubeSats have granted affordable access to space due to their reduced manufacturing costs compared to traditional missions. At the present-day, most miniaturized spacecraft have thus far been deployed into near-Earth orbits, but soon a multitude of interplanetary CubeSats will be employed for deep-space missions as well. Nevertheless, the current paradigm for deep-space missions strongly relies on ground-based operations. Although reliable, this approach will rapidly cause saturation of ground slots, thereby hampering the current momentum in space exploration. At the actual pace, human-in-the-loop, flight-related operations for deep-space missions will soon become unsustainable. Self-driving spacecraft are challenging the current paradigm under which spacecraft are piloted in interplanetary space. They are intended as machines capable of traveling in deep space and autonomously reaching their destination. In EXTREMA, these systems are used to engineer ballistic capture (BC), thereby proving the effectiveness of autonomy in a complex scenario. The key is to accomplish low-thrust orbits culminating in BC. For this, a bundle of BC orbits named ballistic capture corridor (BCC) can be targeted far away from a planet. To achieve BC at Mars without any a priori instruction, an inexpensive and accurate method to construct BCC directly on board is required. Therefore, granting spacecraft the capability to manipulate stable sets in order to self-compute a BCC is crucial. The goal of the paper is to numerically synthesize a corridor exploiting the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) technique, thereby applying a suited uncertainty propagation technique to BC orbit propagation.

 - **Abstract**
 Water is a very abundant molecule in star-forming regions. Its deuterium fractionation is an important tool for understanding its formation and evolution during the star and planet formation processes. While the HDO/H$_2$O ratio has been determined toward several Class 0 protostars and comets, the number of studies toward Class I protostars is limited. We aim to study the water deuteration toward the Class I binary protostar L1551 IRS5 and to investigate the effect of evolutionary stage and environment on variations in the water D/H ratio. Observations were made using the NOEMA interferometer. The HDO 3$_{1,2}$-2$_{2,1}$ transition at 225.9 GHz and the H$_2^{18}$O 3$_{1,3}$-2$_{2,0}$ transition at 203.4 GHz were covered with a spatial resolution of 0.5'' $\times$ 0.8'', while the HDO 4$_{2,2}$-4$_{2,3}$ transition at 143.7 GHz was observed with a resolution of 2.0'' $\times$ 2.5''. We used both LTE and non-LTE models. The three transitions are detected. The line profiles display two peaks, one at $\sim$6 km s$^{-1}$ and one at $\sim$9 km s$^{-1}$. We derive an HDO/H$_2$O ratio of (2.1 $\pm$ 0.8) $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ for the redshifted component and a lower limit of $>$ 0.3 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ for the blueshifted component due to the blending with the redshifted CH$_3$OCH$_3$ emission. The HDO/H$_2$O in L1551 IRS5 is similar to the ratios in isolated Class 0 sources and to the Class I V883 Ori, while it is significantly higher than in the clustered Class 0 sources and the comets. This suggests that the chemistry of protostars in low source densities clouds share more similarities with the isolated sources than the protostars of very dense clusters. If Class 0 protostars with few sources around and isolated Class 0 objects are comparable in the HDO/H$_2$O ratio, it would mean that there is little water reprocessing from the Class 0 to Class I protostellar stage.

 - **Abstract**
 Within the project Evolution of Chemistry in the envelope of HOt corinoS (ECHOS), we present a study of sulphur chemistry in the envelope of the Class 0 source B335 through observations in the spectral range 7, 3, and 2 mm. We have modelled observations assuming LTE and LVG approximation. We have also used the code Nautilus to study the time evolution of sulphur species. We have detected 20 sulphur species with a total gas-phase S abundance similar to that found in the envelopes of other Class 0 objects, but with significant differences in the abundances between sulphur carbon chains and sulphur molecules containing oxygen and nitrogen. Our results highlight the nature of B335 as a source especially rich in sulphur carbon chains unlike other Class 0 sources. The low presence or absence of some molecules, such as SO and SO+, suggests a chemistry not particularly influenced by shocks. We, however, detect a large presence of HCS+ that, together with the low rotational temperatures obtained for all the S species (<15 K), reveals the moderate or low density of the envelope of B335. We also find that observations are better reproduced by models with a sulphur depletion factor of 10 with respect to the sulphur cosmic elemental abundance. The comparison between our model and observational results for B335 reveals an age of 10$^4$$<$t$<$10$^5$ yr, which highlights the particularly early evolutionary stage of this source. B335 presents a different chemistry compared to other young protostars that have formed in dense molecular clouds, which could be the result of accretion of surrounding material from the diffuse cloud onto the protostellar envelope of B335. In addition, the analysis of the SO2/C2S, SO/CS, and HCS+/CS ratios within a sample of prestellar cores and Class 0 objects show that they could be used as good chemical evolutionary indicators of the prestellar to protostellar transition.

 Airborne dust plays an active role in determining the thermal structure and chemical composition of the present-day atmosphere of Mars and possibly the planet's climate evolution over time through radiative--convective and cloud microphysics processes. Thus, accurate measurements of the distribution and variability of dust are required. Observations from the Mars Global Surveyor/Thermal Emission Spectrometer Mars Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter/Mars Climate Sounder and Mars Express/Fourier Transform Spectrometer and the Curiosity Rover have limited capability to measure dust. We show that spacecraft occultation of the Martian atmosphere at far-infrared frequencies between 1 and 10 THz can provide the needed global and temporal data on atmospheric dust by providing co-located measurements of temperature and dust opacity from the top of the atmosphere all the way down to the surface. In addition, spacecraft occultation by a small-satellite constellation could provide global measurements of the development of dust storms.

 - **Abstract**
 The interpretation of observations of atomic and molecular tracers in the galactic and extragalactic interstellar medium (ISM) requires comparisons with state-of-the-art astrophysical models to infer some physical conditions. Usually, ISM models are too time-consuming for such inference procedures, as they call for numerous model evaluations. As a result, they are often replaced by an interpolation of a grid of precomputed models. We propose a new general method to derive faster, lighter, and more accurate approximations of the model from a grid of precomputed models. These emulators are defined with artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed and trained to address the specificities inherent in ISM models. Indeed, such models often predict many observables (e.g., line intensities) from just a few input physical parameters and can yield outliers due to numerical instabilities or physical bistabilities. We propose applying five strategies to address these characteristics: 1) an outlier removal procedure; 2) a clustering method that yields homogeneous subsets of lines that are simpler to predict with different ANNs; 3) a dimension reduction technique that enables to adequately size the network architecture; 4) the physical inputs are augmented with a polynomial transform to ease the learning of nonlinearities; and 5) a dense architecture to ease the learning of simple relations. We compare the proposed ANNs with standard classes of interpolation methods to emulate the Meudon PDR code, a representative ISM numerical model. Combinations of the proposed strategies outperform all interpolation methods by a factor of 2 on the average error, reaching 4.5% on the Meudon PDR code. These networks are also 1000 times faster than accurate interpolation methods and require ten to forty times less memory. This work will enable efficient inferences on wide-field multiline observations of the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the serendipitous discovery of 8 distant ($>$ 50 pc) late M dwarfs with plausible associated radio emission at 144 MHz. The M dwarf nature of our sources has been confirmed with optical spectroscopy performed using HET/LRS2 and Subaru/FOCAS, and their radio flux densities are within the range of 0.5-1.0 mJy at 144 MHz. Considering the radio-optical source separation and source densities of the parent catalogues, we suggest that it is statistically probable the M dwarfs are associated with the radio emission. However, it remains plausible that for some of the sources the radio emission originates from an optically faint and red galaxy hiding behind the M dwarf. The isotropic radio luminosities ($\sim10^{17-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$) of the M dwarfs suggest that if the association is real, the radio emission is likely driven by a coherent emission process produced via plasma or electron-cyclotron maser instability processes, which is potentially caused by binary interaction. Long term monitoring in the radio and high-resolution radio follow-up observations are necessary to search for any variability and pinpoint the radio emission to determine whether our tentative conclusion that these ultracool dwarfs are radio emitting is correct. If the low-frequency radio emission is conclusively associated with the M dwarfs, this would reveal a new population of optically faint and distant ($>$ 50 pc) radio emitting M dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 We use zoom-in, hydrodynamical, cosmological $N$-body simulations tracing the formation of the first stellar clumps from the SImulating the Environments where Globular clusters Emerged (SIEGE) project, to study key structural properties of dark matter haloes when the Universe was only $0.92$ Gyr old. The very high-resolution (maximum physical resolution 0.3 h$^{-1}$ pc at $z=6.14$, smallest dark-matter particle mass $164\,M_{\odot}$) allows us to reach the very low mass end of the stellar-to-halo mass relation ($M_{\rm vir}=10^{7.5-9.5}\,M_{\odot}$) to study the processes that mould dark matter haloes during the first stages of structure formation. We investigate the role of baryonic cooling and stellar feedback, modeled from individual stars, in shaping haloes, and of environmental effects as accretion of dark matter along cosmic filaments and mergers. We find that the onset of star formation (typically for $\log M_{\rm vir}/M_{\odot}\simeq7.6$) causes the inner cusp in the haloes density profile to flatten into a core with constant density and size proportionally to the halo virial mass. Even at these mass scales, we confirm that baryons make haloes that have formed stars rounder in the central regions than haloes that have not formed stars yet, with median minor-to-major $\langle q \rangle$ and intermediate-to-major $\langle s \rangle$ axes 0.66 and 0.84, respectively. Our morphological analysis shows that, at $z=6.14$, haloes are largely prolate in the outer parts, with the major axis aligned along filaments of the cosmic web or towards smaller sub-haloes, with the degree of elongation having no significant dependence on the halo mass.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the physical and chemical properties of the Extended Green Object (EGO) G19.01$-$0.03 using sub-arcsecond angular resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.05mm and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) 1.21cm data. G19.01$-$0.03 MM1, the millimetre source associated with the central massive young stellar object (MYSO), appeared isolated and potentially chemically young in previous Submillimeter Array observations. In our $\sim0.4''$-resolution ALMA data, MM1 has four low-mass millimetre companions within 0.12pc, all lacking maser or outflow emission, indicating they may be prestellar cores. With a rich ALMA spectrum full of complex organic molecules, MM1 does not appear chemically young, but has molecular abundances typical of high-mass hot cores in the literature. At the 1.05mm continuum peak of MM1, $\mathrm{N}(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\mathrm{OH})=(2.22\pm0.01)\times10^{18}$cm$^{-2}$ and $T_{\mathrm{ex}} = 162.7\substack{+0.3 \\ -0.5}$K based on pixel-by-pixel Bayesian analysis of LTE synthetic methanol spectra across MM1. Intriguingly, the peak CH$_{3}$OH $T_{\mathrm{ex}}=165.5\pm0.6$ K is offset from MM1's millimetre continuum peak by $0.22''\sim880$au, and a region of elevated CH$_{3}$OH $T_{\mathrm{ex}}$ coincides with free-free VLA 5.01cm continuum, adding to the tentative evidence for a possible unresolved high-mass binary in MM1. In our VLA 1.21cm data, we report the first NH$_{3}$(3,3) maser detections towards G19.01$-$0.03, along with candidate 25GHz CH$_{3}$OH $5(2,3)-5(1,4)$ maser emission; both are spatially and kinematically coincident with 44GHz Class I CH$_{3}$OH masers in the MM1 outflow. We also report the ALMA detection of candidate 278.3GHz Class I CH$_{3}$OH maser emission towards this outflow, strengthening the connection of these three maser types to MYSO outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 Fifth forces are ubiquitous in modified theories of gravity. In this paper, we analyze their effect on the Cepheid-calibrated cosmic distance ladder, specifically with respect to the inferred value of the Hubble constant ($H_0$). We consider a variety of effective models where the strength, or amount of screening, of the fifth force is estimated using proxy fields related to the large-scale structure of the Universe. For all models considered, the local distance ladder and the Planck value for $H_0$ agrees with a probability $\gtrsim 20 \, \%$, relieving the tension compared to the concordance model with data being excluded at $99 \, \%$ confidence. The alleviated discrepancy comes partially at the cost of an increased tension between distance estimates from Cepheids and the tip of the red-giant branch (TRGB). Demanding also that the consistency between Cepheid and TRGB distance estimates is not impaired, some fifth force models can still accommodate the data with a probability $\gtrsim 20 \, \%$. This provides incentive for more detailed investigations of fundamental theories on which the effective models are based, and their effect on the Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first optical study of the supernova remnant (SNR) G7.7-3.7, with the aim of determining its evolutionary phase since it has been suggested to be the remnant of SN 386 AD. We obtained narrow-band images in the filters H$\alpha$ + [NII], H$\beta$, [OIII], [SII] that revealed faint optical emission in the southern region of the SNR consisting of two filaments elongated in the east-west direction aligned with the X-ray emitting region of the remnant. The filaments were seen in H$\alpha$ + [NII], [OIII] images and marginally in the [SII] images, with a non-detection in H$\beta$. Long-slit spectroscopy of three regions along one filament revealed large ratios of [SII] / H$\alpha$ = (1.6-2.5), consistent with that expected for a shock-heated SNR. The [SII] doublet ratio observed in two of the regions implies an upper limit for the electron density of the gas, with estimates falling below 400 cm$^{-3}$ and 600 cm$^{-3}$ in the respective areas. We discuss potential physical mechanisms that formed the observed optical filaments and we suggest that most likely they resulted by a collision of the SNR with a dense circumstellar shell lying at the southern region of the remnant.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the coupling of hydrodynamics and reactions in simulations of the double detonation model for Type Ia supernovae. When assessing the convergence of simulations, the focus is usually on spatial resolution; however, the method of coupling the physics together as well as the tolerances used in integrating a reaction network also play an important role. In this paper, we explore how the choices made in both coupling and integrating the reaction portion of a simulation (operator / Strang splitting vs.\ the simplified spectral deferred corrections method we introduced previously) influences the accuracy, efficiency, and the nucleosynthesis of simulations of double detonations. We find no need to limit reaction rates or reduce the simulation timestep to the reaction timescale. The entire simulation methodology used here is GPU-accelerated and made freely available as part of the Castro simulation code.
#### Fitting the Light Curve of 1I/`Oumuamua with a Nonprincipal Axis  Rotational Model and Outgassing Torques

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the nonprincipal axis (NPA) rotational state of 1I/`Oumuamua -- the first interstellar object discovered traversing the inner Solar System -- from its photometric light curve. Building upon Mashchenko (2019), we develop a model which incorporates NPA rotation and {Sun-induced, time-varying} outgassing torques to generate synthetic light curves of the object. The model neglects tidal forces, which are negligible compared to outgassing torques over the distances that `Oumuamua was observed. We implement an optimization scheme that incorporates the NPA rotation model to calculate the initial rotation state of the object. We find that an NPA rotation state with an average period of $\langle P \rangle\simeq7.34$ hr best reproduces the photometric data. The discrepancy between this period and previous estimates is due to continuous period modulation induced by outgassing torques in the rotational model, {as well as different periods being used}. The best fit to the October 2017 data does not reproduce the November 2017 data (although the later measurements are too sparse to fit). The light curve is consistent with no secular evolution of the angular momentum, somewhat in tension with the empirical correlations between nuclear spin-up and cometary outgassing. The complex rotation of `Oumuamua may be {the result of primordial rotation about the smallest principal axis} if (i) the object experienced hypervolatile outgassing and (ii) our idealized outgassing model is accurate.

 - **Abstract**
 There is a desire to observe the sun's poles to further deepen our understanding of solar activity. However, because of the large speeds needed to perform out-of-ecliptic plane maneuvers, chemical and electric rocket propulsion mechanisms have been proven to be costly and impractical, leaving alternative space technology systems like solar sails to be considered for these applications. In this paper, we study the possibility of using a solar sail as a probe observing the sun. We design and optimize the trajectories of the solar sail probe through the surface constraint approach, with the assumption that the sail moves on a displaced spherical surface. We first review the surface constraint approach, focusing on its important assumptions and limitations. Then, we solve and obtain a family of radial and azimuthal trajectory equations by choosing the correct constraint equation. We characterize the trajectories based on the functional dependence of the sail's orientation with the polar angle. Finally, we determine the trajectories of the probe that will give us the minimum flight time. Results show that increasing the number of mission stages decreases the total flight time, with minimal changes in the sail's radial and polar velocities. Furthermore, changing the functional dependence of the clock angle resets the azimuthal velocity, making the sail not reverse its direction and directly approach the sun along the spherical surface.

 - **Abstract**
 Comet 157P is a faint object with a history of being prone to unfortunate situations, circumstances, and/or coincidences. Several weeks after its 1978 discovery the comet disappeared and remained lost nonstop for twenty five years. Rediscovered in 2003 as a new comet, it was about 500 times brighter than in 1978, caught apparently in one of its outbursts. The comet was not detected 200 days after its 2016 perihelion, being fainter than mag 20, but 80 days later it was mag 16 and gradually fading back to mag 20 over a period of four months. The comet did not miss the opportunity to have a close encounter with Jupiter, having approached it to less than 0.3 AU on 2020 February 10. The 2017 outburst or surge of activity appears to have accompanied an event of nuclear fragmentation. The birth of a second companion is dated to the months following the Jupiter encounter. The series of weird episodes culminated near the 2022 perihelion, when one companion brightened to become observable for two weeks and after another two weeks the other flared up to be seen for the next two weeks. Unnoticed, this incredible coincidence fooled some experts into believing that a single object, designated 157P-B, was involved, even though its orbit left large residuals. I now offer representative fragmentation solutions for the two companions, the mean residuals amounting to +/-0".4 and +/-1".0, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 The ubiquity of information transmission via molecular communication between cells is comprehensively documented on Earth; this phenomenon might even have played a vital role in the origin(s) and early evolution of life. Motivated by these considerations, a simple model for molecular communication entailing the diffusion of signaling molecules from transmitter to receiver is elucidated. The channel capacity $C$ (maximal rate of information transmission) and an optimistic heuristic estimate of the actual information transmission rate $\mathcal{I}$ are derived for this communication system; the two quantities, especially the latter, are demonstrated to be broadly consistent with laboratory experiments and more sophisticated theoretical models. The channel capacity exhibits a potentially weak dependence on environmental parameters, whereas the actual information transmission rate may scale with the intercellular distance $d$ as $\mathcal{I} \propto d^{-4}$ and could vary substantially across settings. These two variables are roughly calculated for diverse astrobiological environments, ranging from Earth's upper oceans ($C \sim 3.1 \times 10^3$ bits/s; $\mathcal{I} \sim 4.7 \times 10^{-2}$ bits/s) and deep sea hydrothermal vents ($C \sim 4.2 \times 10^3$ bits/s; $\mathcal{I} \sim 1.2 \times 10^{-1}$ bits/s) to the hydrocarbon lakes and seas of Titan ($C \sim 3.8 \times 10^3$ bits/s; $\mathcal{I} \sim 2.6 \times 10^{-1}$ bits/s).

 - **Abstract**
 We test the consistency of dark matter velocity distributions obtained from dark matter-only numerical simulations with analytic predictions, using the publicly available Via Lactea 2 dataset as an example. We find that, well inside the scale radius, the velocity distribution obtained from numerical simulation is consistent with a function of a single integral of motion -- the energy -- and moreover is consistent with the result obtained from Eddington inversion. This indicates that the assumptions underlying the analytic result, namely, spherical symmetry, isotropy, and a static potential, are sufficiently accurate to govern the coarse properties of the velocity distribution in the inner regions of the halo. We discuss implications for the behavior of the high-velocity tail of the distribution, which can dominate dark matter annihilation from a $p$- or $d$-wave state.

 - **Abstract**
 Type II supernovae represent the most common stellar explosions in the Universe, for which the final stage evolution of their hydrogen-rich massive progenitors towards core-collapse explosion are elusive. The recent explosion of SN 2023ixf in a very nearby galaxy, Messier 101, provides a rare opportunity to explore this longstanding issue. With the timely high-cadence flash spectra taken within 1-5 days after the explosion, we can put stringent constraints on the properties of the surrounding circumstellar material around this supernova. Based on the rapid fading of the narrow emission lines and luminosity/profile of $\rm H\alpha$ emission at very early times, we estimate that the progenitor of SN 2023ixf lost material at a mass-loss rate $\dot{\rm M} \approx 6 \times 10^{-4}\, \rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ over the last 2-3 years before explosion. This close-by material, moving at a velocity $v_{\rm w} \approx 55\rm \, km\,s^{-1}$, accumulates a compact CSM shell at the radius smaller than $7 \times 10^{14}$ cm from the progenitor. Given the high mass-loss rate and relatively large wind velocity presented here, together with the pre-explosion observations made about two decades ago, the progenitor of SN 2023ixf could be a short-lived yellow hypergiant that evolved from a red supergiant shortly before the explosion.
#### Matched filtering for gravitational wave detection without template bank  driven by deep learning template prediction model bank

 - **Abstract**
 The existing matched filtering method for gravitational wave (GW) search relies on a template bank. The computational efficiency of this method scales with the size of the templates within the bank. Higher-order modes and eccentricity will play an important role when third-generation detectors operate in the future. In this case, traditional GW search methods will hit computational limits. To speed up the computational efficiency of GW search, we propose the utilization of a deep learning (DL) model bank as a substitute for the template bank. This model bank predicts the latent templates embedded in the strain data. Combining an envelope extraction network and an astrophysical origin discrimination network, we realize a novel GW search framework. The framework can predict the GW signal's matched filtering signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Unlike the end-to-end DL-based GW search method, our statistical SNR holds greater physical interpretability than the $p_{score}$ metric. Moreover, the intermediate results generated by our approach, including the predicted template, offer valuable assistance in subsequent GW data processing tasks such as parameter estimation and source localization. Compared to the traditional matched filtering method, the proposed method can realize real-time analysis. The minor improvements in the future, the proposed method may expand to other scopes of GW search, such as GW emitted by the supernova explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 For cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization observations, calibration of detector polarization angles is essential. We have developed a fully remote controlled calibration system with a sparse wire grid that reflects linearly polarized light along the wire direction. The new feature is a remote-controlled system for regular calibration, which has not been possible in sparse wire grid calibrators in past experiments. The remote control can be achieved by two electric linear actuators that load or unload the sparse wire grid into a position centered on the optical axis of a telescope between the calibration time and CMB observation. Furthermore, the sparse wire grid can be rotated by a motor. A rotary encoder and a gravity sensor are installed on the sparse wire grid to monitor the wire direction. They allow us to achieve detector angle calibration with expected systematic error of $0.08^{\circ}$. The calibration system will be installed in small-aperture telescopes at Simons Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 The Coronagraph Instrument of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman Coronagraph) will be capable of both total intensity and polarization measurements of circumstellar disks. The polarimetric performance is impacted by polarization effects introduced by all mirrors before the Wollaston prisms. In this paper, we aim to characterize these effects for the Roman Coronagraph in bands 1 and 4 using the FALCO and PROPER packages. We simulate the effect of polarization aberrations that impact the polarimetric contrast and the instrumental polarization effects to study the polarimetric accuracy. We include spacecraft rolls, but leave out systematic camera noise. We find that polarimetric differential imaging (PDI) improves the contrast by a factor of six. The PDI contrast of $\sim 8 \times 10^{-11}$ is limited by polarized speckles from instrumental polarization effects and polarization aberrations. By injecting polarized companions with at various contrast levels and demodulating their polarimetric signal, we recover their source Stokes vector within 2%.

 - **Abstract**
 The future Habitable Worlds Observatory aims to characterize the atmospheres of rocky exoplanets around solar-type stars. The vector vortex coronagraph (VVC) is a main candidate to reach the required contrast of $10^{-10}$. However, the VVC requires polarization filtering and every observing band requires a different VVC. The triple-grating vector vortex coronagraph (tgVVC) aims to mitigate these limitations by combining multiple gratings that minimize the polarization leakage over a large spectral bandwidth. In this paper, we present laboratory results of a tgVVC prototype using the In-Air Coronagraphic Testbed (IACT) facility at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB) at the University of Arizona Space Astrophysics Lab (UASAL). We study the coronagraphic performance with polarization filtering at 633 nm and reach a similar average contrast of $2 \times 10^{-8}$ between 3-18 $\lambda/D$ at the IACT, and $6 \times 10^{-8}$ between 3-14 $\lambda/D$ at SCoOB. We explore the limitations of the tgVVC by comparing the testbed results. We report on other manufacturing errors and ways to mitigate their impact.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new gas-grain chemical model for the combined isotopic fractionation of carbon and nitrogen in molecular clouds, in which the isotope chemistry of carbon and nitrogen is coupled with a time-dependent description of spin-state chemistry. We updated the rate coefficients of some isotopic exchange reactions considered in the literature, and present here a set of new exchange reactions involving molecules substituted in $\rm ^{13}C$ and $\rm ^{15}N$ simultaneously. We apply the model to a series of zero-dimensional simulations representing a set of physical conditions across a prototypical prestellar core, exploring the deviations of the isotopic abundance ratios in the various molecules from the elemental isotopic ratios as a function of physical conditions and time. We find that the $\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratio can deviate from the elemental ratio by up to a factor of several depending on the molecule, and that there are highly time-dependent variations in the ratios. The $\rm HCN/H^{13}CN$ ratio, for example, can obtain values of less than 10 depending on the simulation time. The $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N$ ratios tend to remain close to the assumed elemental ratio within $\sim$ ten per cent, with no clear trends as a function of the physical conditions. Abundance ratios between $\rm ^{13}C$-containing molecules and $\rm ^{13}C$+$\rm ^{15}N$-containing molecules show somewhat increased levels of fractionation due to the newly included exchange reactions, though still remaining within a few tens of per cent of the elemental $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N$ ratio. Our results imply the existence of gradients in isotopic abundance ratios across prestellar cores, suggesting that detailed simulations are required to interpret observations of isotopically substituted molecules correctly, especially given that the various isotopic forms of a given molecule do not necessarily trace the same gas layers.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a new general-relativistic viscous-radiation hydrodynamics simulation for supernova-like explosion associated with stellar core collapse of rotating massive stars to a system of a black hole and a massive torus paying particular attention to large-mass progenitor stars with the zero-age main-sequence mass of $M_\mathrm{ZAMS}=$20, 35, and 45$M_\odot$ of Ref.~\cite{Aguilera-Dena2020oct}. Assuming that a black hole is formed in a short timescale after the onset of the stellar collapse, the new simulations are started from initial data of a spinning black hole and infalling matter that self-consistently satisfy the constraint equations of general relativity. It is found that with a reasonable size of the viscous parameter, the supernova-like explosion is driven by the viscous heating effect in the torus around the black hole irrespective of the progenitor mass. The typical explosion energy and ejecta mass for the large-mass cases ($M_\mathrm{ZAMS}=35$ and $45M_\odot$) are $\sim 10^{52}$ erg and $\sim 5M_\odot$, respectively, with $^{56}$Ni mass larger than $0.15M_\odot$. These are consistent with the observational data of stripped-envelope and high-energy supernovae such as broad-lined type Ic supernovae. This indicates that rotating stellar collapses of massive stars to a black hole surrounded by a massive torus can be a central engine for high-energy supernovae. By artificially varying the angular velocity of the initial data, we explore the dependence of the explosion energy and ejecta mass on the initial angular momentum and find that the large explosion energy $\sim 10^{52}$ erg and large $^{56}$Ni mass $\geq 0.15M_\odot$ are possible only when a large-mass compact torus with mass $\gtrsim 1M_\odot$ is formed.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the process in which axion dark matter undergoes thermal friction, resulting in energy injection into dark radiation, with the aim of mitigating the Hubble tension and large-scale structure tension. In the early universe, this scenario led to a rapid increase in the energy density of dark radiation; in the late universe, the evolution of axion dark matter is similar to that of cold dark matter, with this scenario resembling decaying dark matter and serving to ease the large-scale structure tension. We employ cosmological observational data, including cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), supernova data (SNIa), $H_0$ measurement from SH0ES, and $S_8$ from the Dark Energy Survey Year-3 (DES), to study and analyze this model. Our results indicate that the thermal friction model offers partial alleviation of the large-scale structure tension, while its contribution on alleviating Hubble tension can be ignored. The new model constrained by the complete dataset yields the value of $S_8$ is $0.795\pm 0.011$ at 68\% confidence level, while the $\Lambda$CDM model yields a result of $0.8023\pm 0.0085$. In addition, when constrained solely by CMB, BAO, and SNIa data, the $\Lambda$CDM model exhibits a smaller $\chi^2_\mathrm{tot}$ statistical value. However, upon incorporating SH0ES and DES data, the new model exhibits a lower $\chi^2_\mathrm{tot}$ value, with a difference of -2.60 compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model.

 - **Abstract**
 Edukoi is a software that aims to make interactive sonification suitable to convey and extract information. The program design is a modification of the software Herakoi, which sonifies images in real time mapping pitch to colour using a motion-aware approach for allowing users to interact with images through sound. The pitch-colour association of Hearkoi, albeit pleasing from the entertainment side, is not efficient for communicating specific information regarding colours and hues to listeners. Hence we modified it to create an instrument to be used by visually impaired and sighted children to explore images through sound and extract accurate information. We aim at building a flexible software that can be used in middle-schools for both art and science teaching. We tested its effectiveness using astronomical images, given the great fascination that astronomy always has on kids of all ages and backgrounds. Astronomy is also considered a very visual science, a characteristic that prevents students from learning this subject and having a related career. With this project we aim to challenge this belief and give to students the possibility to explore astronomical data through sound. Here we discuss our experiment, the choices we made regarding sound mappings, and what psychophysiological aspects we aim to evaluate to validate and improve Edukoi.
#### Mars orientation and rotation angles

 - **Abstract**
 The rotation and orientation of Mars is commonly described using two different sets of angles, namely the Euler angles wrt the Mars orbit plane and the right ascension, declination, and prime meridian location angles wrt the Earth equator at J2000 (as adopted by the IAU). We propose a formulation for both these sets of angles, which consists of the sum of a second degree polynomial and of periodic and Poisson series. Such a formulation is shown here to enable accurate (and physically sound) transformation from one set of angles to the other. The transformation formulas are provided and discussed in this paper. In particular, we point that the quadratic and Poisson terms are key ingredients to reach a transformation precision of 0.1 mas, even 30 years away from the reference epoch of the rotation model (e.g. J2000). Such a precision is required to accurately determine the smaller and smaller geophysical signals observed in the high-accuracy data acquired from the surface of Mars. In addition, we present good practices to build an accurate Martian rotation model over a long time span (30 years around J2000) or over a shorter one (e.g. lifetime of a space mission). We recommend to consider the J2000 mean orbit of Mars as the reference plane for Euler angles. An accurate rotation model should make use of up-to-date models for the rigid and liquid nutations, relativistic corrections in rotation, and polar motion induced by the external torque. Our transformation model and recommendations can be used to define the future IAU solution for the rotation and orientation of Mars using right ascension, declination, and prime meridian location. In particular, thanks to its quadratic terms, our transformation model does not introduce arbitrary and non-physical terms of very long period and large amplitudes, thus providing unbiased values of the rates and epoch values of the angles.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the expected population of core collapse supernova remnants and the huge number of detected pulsars in the Galaxy, still representing only a fraction of the real population, pulsar wind nebulae are likely to constitute one of the largest classes of {extended} Galactic sources in many energy bands. For simple evolutionary reasons, the majority of the population is made of evolved systems, whose detection and identification are complicated by their reduced luminosity, the possible lack of X-ray emission (that fades progressively away with the age of the pulsar), and by their modified morphology with respect to young systems. Nevertheless they have gained renewed attention in recent years, following the detection of misaligned X-ray tails protruding from an increasing number of nebulae created by fast moving pulsars, and of extended TeV halos surrounding aged systems. Both these features are clear signs of an efficient escape of particles, with energy close to the maximum acceleration limit of the pulsar. Here we discuss the properties of those evolved systems and what we have understood about the process of particle escape, and the formation of observed features.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent radio observations and coincident neutrino detections suggest that some tidal disruption events (TDEs) exhibit late-time activities, relative to the optical emission peak, and these may be due to delayed outflows launched from the central supermassive black hole. We investigate the possibility that jets launched with a time delay of days to months, interact with a debris that may expand outwards. We discuss the effects of the time delay and expansion velocity on the outcomes of jet breakout and collimation. We find that a jet with an isotropic-equivalent luminosity of $\lesssim 5 \times 10^{45}\,{\rm erg/s}$ is likely to be choked for a delay time of $\sim 3$ months. We also study the observational signatures of such delayed choked jets. The jet-debris interaction preceding the breakout would lead to particle acceleration and the resulting synchrotron emission can be detected by current and near-future radio, optical and X-ray telescopes, and the expanding jet-driven debris could explain late-time radio emission. We discuss high-energy neutrino production in delayed choked jets, and the time delay can significantly alleviate the difficulty of the hidden jet scenario in explaining neutrino coincidences.

 - **Abstract**
 Cool astrophysical objects, such as (exo)planets, brown dwarfs, or asymptotic giant branch stars, can be strongly affected by condensation. Condensation does not only directly affect the chemical composition of the gas phase by removing elements but the condensed material also influences other chemical and physical processes in these object. This includes, for example, the formation of clouds in planetary atmospheres and brown dwarfs or the dust-driven winds of evolved stars. In this study we introduce FastChem Cond, a new version of the FastChem equilibrium chemistry code that adds a treatment of equilibrium condensation. Determining the equilibrium composition under the impact of condensation is complicated by the fact that the number of condensates that can exist in equilibrium with the gas phase is limited by a phase rule. However, this phase rule does not directly provide information on which condensates are stable. As a major advantage of FastChem Cond is able to automatically select the set stable condensates satisfying the phase rule. Besides the normal equilibrium condensation, FastChem Cond can also be used with the rainout approximation that is commonly employed in atmospheres of brown dwarfs or (exo)planets. FastChem Cond is available as open-source code, released under the GPLv3 licence. In addition to the C++ code, FastChem Cond also offers a Python interface. Together with the code update we also add about 290 liquid and solid condensate species to FastChem.

 - **Abstract**
 Measurements of neutron star masses, radii, and tidal deformability have direct connections to nuclear physics via the equation of state (EoS), which for the cold, catalyzed matter in neutron star cores is commonly represented as the pressure as a function of energy density. Microscopic models with exotic degrees of freedom display nontrivial structure in the speed of sound ($c_s$) in the form of first-order phase transitions and bumps, oscillations, and plateaus in the case of crossovers and higher-order phase transitions. We present a procedure based on Gaussian processes to generate an ensemble of EoSs that include nontrivial features. Using a Bayesian analysis incorporating measurements from X-ray sources, gravitational wave observations, and perturbative QCD results, we show that these features are compatible with current constraints. We investigate the possibility of a global maximum in $c_s$ that occurs within the densities realized in neutron stars -- implying a softening of the EoS and possibly an exotic phase in the core of massive stars -- and find that such a global maximum is consistent with, but not required by, current constraints.
#### Gas Kinematics in the Magellanic-Type Galaxy NGC 7292

 - **Abstract**
 The paper presents results of studying the kinematics of the ionized gas in the galaxy of the Large Magellanic Cloud type NGC 7292 obtained with the 2.5-m telescope of the Caucasian Mountain Observatory (CMO SAI MSU) and the 6-m BTA telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory (SAO RAS). Analysis of the velocity fields of the ionized and neutral hydrogen showed that the kinematic center of NGC 7292 located at the center of the bar, northwest of the photometric center of the galaxy (the southeastern end of the bar) previously taken as the center of NGC 7292. In addition to the circular rotation of the gas, the radial motions associated with the bar play a significant role in the kinematics of the disk. The observed perturbations of the gaseous-disk kinematics induced by the ongoing star formation do not exceed those caused by the bar. It is possible that part of the non-circular motions (at the southeastern end of the bar which is the brightest HII region) may be related to the effects of the capture of a dwarf companion or a gaseous cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nanohertz frequencies by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has sparked a flurry of interest. Beyond the standard interpretation that the progenitor is a network of supermassive black hole binaries, many exotic models have also been proposed, some of which can potentially offer a better fit to the data. We explore how the various connections between gravitational waves and CMB spectral distortions can be leveraged to help determine whether a SGWB was generated primordially or astrophysically. To this end, we present updated $k$-space window functions which can be used for distortion parameter estimation on enhancements to the primordial scalar power spectrum. These same enhancements can also source gravitational waves (GWs) directly at second order in perturbation theory, so-called scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs), and indirectly through the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). We perform a mapping of scalar power spectrum constraints into limits on the GW parameter space of SIGWs for $\delta$-function features. We highlight that broader features in the scalar spectrum can explain the PTA results while simultaneously producing a spectral distortion (SD) within reach of future experiments. We additionally update PBH constraints from $\mu$- and $y$-type spectral distortions. Refined treatments of the distortion window functions widen existing SD constraints, and we find that a future CMB spectrometer could play a pivotal role in unraveling the origin of GWs imprinted at or below CMB anisotropy scales.
#### Sesquinary Catastrophe For Close-In Moons with Dynamically Excited  Orbits

 - **Abstract**
 We identify a new mechanism that can lead to the destruction of small, close-in planetary satellites. If a small moon close to the planet has a sizable eccentricity and inclination, its ejecta that escape to planetocentric orbit would often re-impact with much higher velocity due to the satellite's and the fragment's orbits precessing out of alignment. If the impacts of returning ejecta result in net erosion, a runaway process can occur which may end in disruption of the satellite, and we term this process ``sesquinary catastrophe''. We expect the moon to re-accrete, but on an orbit with significantly lower eccentricity and inclination. We find that the large majority of small close-in moons in the Solar System, have orbits that are immune to sesquinary catastrophe. The exceptions include a number of resonant moonlets of Saturn for which resonances may affect the velocities of re-impact of their own debris. Additionally, we find that Neptune's moon Naiad (and to a lesser degree, Jupiter's Thebe) must have substantial internal strength, in line with prior estimates based on Roche limit stability. We also find that sesquinary instability puts important constraints on the plausible past orbits of Phobos and Deimos or their progenitors.
