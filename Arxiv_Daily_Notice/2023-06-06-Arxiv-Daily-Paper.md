#### Characterizing the Directionality of Gravitational Wave Emission from  Matter Motions within Core-collapse Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the directional dependence of the gravitational wave (GW) emission from 15 3D neutrino radiation hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae. We develop a new analytic technique to characterize the distribution of GW emission over all angles. We use physics-informed toy models to provide closed form expressions for the distribution of GW emission for different CCSN phases. Using these toy models, we approximate the PNS dynamics during multiple CCSN stages and obtain similar GW distributions to simulation outputs. By applying this new technique throughout the supernova duration, we construct a distribution of preferred directions of GW emission. Our findings indicate CCSNe do not have a single `optimal' viewing angle along which the strongest GWs can be detected. For nonrotating cases, this dominant viewing angle drifts isotropically throughout the supernova, set by the dynamical timescale of the protoneutron star. For rotating cases, during core bounce and the following tens of ms, the strongest GW signal is observed along the equator. During the accretion phase, comparable -- if not stronger -- GW amplitudes are generated along the axis of rotation, which can be enhanced by the low T/|W| instability. We show two dominant factors influencing the directionality of GW emission are the degree of initial rotation and explosion morphology. Lastly, looking forward, we note the sensitive interplay between GW detector site and supernova orientation, along with its effect on detecting individual polarization modes.
#### In Search of Global 21-cm Signal using Artificial Neural Network in  light of EDGES and ARCADE 2

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the astrophysical nature of the first stars still remains an unsolved problem in cosmology. The redshifted global 21-cm signal and power spectrum act as a treasure trove to probe the Cosmic Dawn era -- when the intergalactic medium was mostly neutral. Many experiments, like SARAS 3, SKA, EDGES, DARE, etc., have been proposed to probe the cosmic dawn era. However, extracting the faint cosmological signal buried inside the brighter foregrounds $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ remains challenging. Considering the excess radio background, we have constructed all possible $T_{21}$ signals in the EDGES limit. We have used a single Artificial Neural Network for $T_{21}$ parameter extraction in the presence of the foreground and noise with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R-Squared (R2) score of $(0.2 - 0.08)$ and $(0.66 - 0.94)$, respectively. Here, we also explore the parameter estimation in the presence of heating of intergalactic medium due to background radio radiation mediated by Ly$\alpha$ photons from first stars, and we found that the effect indeed has a significant impact on parameters correlation and their estimation.
#### The Orbital Structure and Selection Effects of the Galactic Center  S-Star Cluster
 - **Authors:** Andreas Burkert, Stefan Gillessen, Douglas N.C. Lin, Xiaochen Zheng, Philipp Schoeller, Frank Eisenhauer, Reinhard Genzel

 - **Abstract**
 The orbital distribution of the S-star cluster surrounding the supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way is analyzed. A tight, roughly exponential dependence of the pericenter distance r$_{p}$ on orbital eccentricity e$_{\star}$ is found, $\log ($r$_p)\sim$(1-e$_{\star}$), which cannot be explained simply by a random distribution of semi-major axes and eccentricities. No stars are found in the region with high e$_{\star}$ and large log r$_{p}$ or in the region with low e$_{\star}$ and small log r$_{p}$. G-clouds follow the same correlation. The likelihood P(log r$_p$,(1-e$_{\star}$)) to determine the orbital parameters of S-stars is determined. P is very small for stars with large e$_{\star}$ and large log r$_{p}$. S-stars might exist in this region. To determine their orbital parameters, one however needs observations over a longer time period. On the other hand, if stars would exist in the region of low log r$_{p}$ and small e$_{\star}$, their orbital parameters should by now have been determined. That this region is unpopulated therefore indicates that no S-stars exist with these orbital characteristics, providing constraints for their formation. We call this region, defined by $\log$ (r$_p$/AU) $<$ 1.57+2.6(1-e$_{\star})$, the zone of avoidance. Finally, it is shown that the observed frequency of eccentricities and pericenter distances is consistent with a random sampling of log r$_{p}$ and e$_{\star}$. However, only if one takes into account that no stars exist in the zone of avoidance and that orbital parameters cannot yet be determined for stars with large r$_{p}$ and large e$_{\star}$.
#### Meterwavelength Single-pulse Polarimetric Emission Survey. VI. Towards  understanding the Phenomenon of Pulsar Polarization in Partially Screened  Vacuum Gap model
 - **Authors:** Dipanjan Mitra, George I. Melikidze, Rahul Basu
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02537
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02537
 - **Abstract**
 We have observed 123 pulsars with periods longer than 0.1 seconds in the Meterwavelength Single-pulse Polarimetric Emission Survey. In this work a detailed study of polarization behaviour of these pulsars have been carried out. We were able to fit the rotating vector model to the polarization position angle sweeps in 68 pulsars, and in 34 pulsars the emission heights could be measured. In all cases the radio emission was constrained to arise below 10\% of the light cylinder radius. In pulsars with low spindown energy loss, $\dot{E}<10^{34}$ ergs s$^{-1}$, we found the mean fractional linear polarization of the individual times samples in single pulses to be around 0.57 (57\%) which is significantly larger than the fractional linear polarization of 0.29 (29\%) obtained from the average profiles. On the other hand the mean fractional circular polarization of the individual time samples in single pulses is around 0.08 (8\%), similar to the measurements from the average profiles. To explain the observed polarization features, we invoke the partially screened vacuum gap model of pulsars, where dense spark associated plasma clouds exist with high pair plasma multiplicity, with significant decrease of density in the regions between the clouds, that are dominated by iron ions. The coherent radio emission is excited by curvature radiation from charge bunches in these dense plasma clouds and escape as linearly polarized waves near cloud boundaries. We suggest that the circular polarization arises due to propagation of waves in the low pair multiplicity, ion dominated inter-cloud regions.
#### binary_c-python: A Python-based stellar population synthesis tool and  interface to binary_c
 - **Authors:** D.D. Hendriks, R.G. Izzard
 - **Subjects:** Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02779
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02779
 - **Abstract**
 We present the software package binary_c-python which provides a convenient and easy-to-use interface to the binary_c framework, allowing the user to rapidly evolve individual systems and populations of stars. binary_c-python is available on Pip and on GitLab. binary_c-python contains many useful features to control and process the output of binary_c, like by providing binary_c-python with logging statements that are dynamically compiled and loaded into binary_c. Moreover, we have recently added standardised output of events like Roche-lobe overflow or double compact-object formation to binary_c, and automatic parsing and managing of that output in binary_c-python. binary_c-python uses multiprocessing to utilise all the cores on a particular machine, and can run populations with HPC cluster workload managers like HTCondor and Slurm, allowing the user to run simulations on large computing clusters. We provide documentation that is automatically generated based on docstrings and a suite of Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks consist of technical tutorials on how to use binary_c-python and use-case scenarios aimed at doing science. Much of binary_c-python is covered by unit tests to ensure reliability and correctness, and the test coverage is continually increased as the package is improved.

 - **Abstract**
 Early dust grain growth in protostellar envelopes infalling on young discs has been suggested in recent studies, supporting the hypothesis that dust particles start to agglomerate already during the Class 0/I phase of young stellar objects (YSOs). If this early evolution were confirmed, it would impact the usually assumed initial conditions of planet formation, where only particles with sizes $\lesssim 0.25 \mu$m are usually considered for protostellar envelopes. We aim to determine the maximum grain size of the dust population in the envelope of the Class 0/I protostar L1527 IRS, located in the Taurus star-forming region (140 pc). We use Atacama Large millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) and Atacama Compact Array (ACA) archival data and present new observations, in an effort to both enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the faint extended continuum emission and properly account for the compact emission from the inner disc. Using observations performed in four wavelength bands and extending the spatial range of previous studies, we aim to place tight constraints on the spectral ($\alpha$) and dust emissivity ($\beta$) indices in the envelope of L1527 IRS. We find a rather flat $\alpha \sim$ 3.0 profile in the range 50-2000 au. Accounting for the envelope temperature profile, we derive values for the dust emissivity index, 0.9 < $\beta$ < 1.6, and reveal a tentative, positive outward gradient. This could be interpreted as a distribution of mainly ISM-like grains at 2000 au, gradually progressing to (sub-)millimetre-sized dust grains in the inner envelope, where at R=300 au, $\beta$ = 1.1 +/- 0.1. Our study supports a variation of the dust properties in the envelope of L1527 IRS. We discuss how this can be the result of in-situ grain growth, dust differential collapse from the parent core, or upward transport of disc large grains.
#### Searching for signatures of H $α$ spicule-like features in the  solar transition region
 - **Authors:** Nived Vilangot Nhalil, Juie Shetye, J. Gerry Doyle
 - **Subjects:** Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

 - **Abstract**
 New instrumental and telescopes covering the optical and ultra-violet spectral regions have revealed a range of small-scale dynamic features, many which may be related. For example, the range of spicule-like features hints towards a spectrum of features and not just two types; however, direct observational evidence in terms of tracking spicules across multiple wavelengths are needed in order to provide further insight into the dynamics of the Sun's outer atmosphere. This paper uses H $\alpha$ data obtained with the CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter instrument on the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, and in the transition region using the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph with the SJI 1400 {\AA} channel plus spectral data via the Si IV 1394 {\AA} line to track spicules termed Rapid Blue-shifted Excursions (RBEs). The RBEs as seen in the H $\alpha$ blue-wing images presented here can be sub-divided into two categories; a single or multi-threaded feature. Based on the H $\alpha$ spectra, the features can be divided into events showing broadening and line core absorption, events showing broadening and line core emission, events with a pure blue shifted H $\alpha$ profile without any absorption in the red wing, broadened line profile with the absorption in the blue stronger compared to the red wing. From the RBE-like events which have a Si IV 1394 {\AA} line profile, 78% of them show a Si IV line flux increase. Most of these features show a second broadened Si IV component which is slightly blue-shifted.
