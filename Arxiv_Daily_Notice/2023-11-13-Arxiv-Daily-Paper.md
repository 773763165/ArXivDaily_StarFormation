 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a cosmological model in which a fraction of the dark matter is atomic dark matter (ADM). This ADM consists of dark versions of the electron and of the proton, interacting with each other and with dark photons just as their light sector versions do, but interacting with everything else only gravitationally. We find constraints given current cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, with and without an $H_0$ prior, and with and without enforcing a big bang nucleosynthesis consistent helium abundance. We find that, at low dark photon temperature, one can have consistency with BAO and CMB data, with a fraction of dark matter that is ADM ($f_{\rm adm}$) as large as $\sim 0.1$. Such a large $f_{\rm adm}$ leads to a suppression of density fluctuations today on scales below about 60 Mpc that may be of relevance to the $\sigma_8$ tension. Our work motivates calculation of nonlinear corrections to matter power spectrum predictions in the ADM model. We forecast parameter constraints to come from future ground-based CMB surveys, and find that if ADM is indeed the cause of the $\sigma_8$ tension, the influence of the ADM, primarily on CMB lensing, will likely be detectable at high significance.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrometry from the Gaia mission was recently used to discover the two nearest known stellar-mass black holes (BHs), Gaia BH1 and Gaia BH2. Both systems contain $\sim 1\,M_{\odot}$ stars in wide orbits ($a\approx$1.4 AU, 4.96 AU) around $\sim9\,M_{\odot}$ BHs. These objects are among the first stellar-mass BHs not discovered via X-rays or gravitational waves. The companion stars -- a solar-type main sequence star in Gaia BH1 and a low-luminosity red giant in Gaia BH2 -- are well within their Roche lobes. However, the BHs are still expected to accrete stellar winds, leading to potentially detectable X-ray or radio emission. Here, we report observations of both systems with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and radio observations with the Very Large Array (for Gaia BH1) and MeerKAT (for Gaia BH2). We did not detect either system, leading to X-ray upper limits of $L_X < 10^{29.4}$ and $L_X < 10^{30.1}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ and radio upper limits of $L_r < 10^{25.2}$ and $L_r < 10^{25.9}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. For Gaia BH2, the non-detection implies that the the accretion rate near the horizon is much lower than the Bondi rate, consistent with recent models for hot accretion flows. We discuss implications of these non-detections for broader BH searches, concluding that it is unlikely that isolated BHs will be detected via ISM accretion in the near future. We also calculate evolutionary models for the binaries' future evolution using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). We find that Gaia BH1 will be X-ray bright for 5--50 Myr when the star is a red giant, including 5 Myr of stable Roche lobe overflow. Since no symbiotic BH X-ray binaries are known, this implies either that fewer than $\sim 10^4$ Gaia BH1-like binaries exist in the Milky Way, or that they are common but have evaded detection, perhaps due to very long outburst recurrence timescales.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper provides an overview of genetic algorithms as a powerful tool in optimization for single and multi-modal functions. We illustrate this technique using analytical examples and then, we explore how genetic algorithms can be used as a parameter estimation tool in cosmological models to maximize the likelihood function. Finally, we discuss potential future applications of these algorithms in the cosmological field.
#### Comets $^{12}$CO$^+$ and $^{13}$CO$^+$ fluorescence models for measuring  the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratio in CO$^+$

 - **Abstract**
 Context: CO is an abundant species in comets, creating CO$^+$ ion with emission lines that can be observed in the optical spectral range. A good modeling of its fluorescence spectrum is important for a better measurement of the CO$^+$ abundance. Such a species, if abundant enough, can also be used to measure the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratio. Aims: This study uses the opportunity of a high CO content observed in the comet C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS), that created bright CO$^{+}$ emission lines in the optical range, to build and test a new fluorescence model of this species and to measure for the first time the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratio in this chemical species with ground-based observations. Methods: Thanks to laboratory data and theoretical works available in the scientific literature we developed a new fluorescence model both for $^{12}$CO$^+$ and $^{13}$CO$^+$ ions. The $^{13}$CO$^+$ model can be used for coadding faint emission lines and obtain a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to detect this isotopologue. Results: Our fluorescence model provides a good modeling of the $^{12}$CO$^+$ emission lines, allowing to publish revised fluorescence efficiencies. Based on similar transition probabilities for $^{12}$CO$^+$ and $^{13}$CO$^+$ we derive a $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratio of 73$\pm$20 for CO$^+$ in comet C/2016 R2. This value is in agreement with the solar system ratio of 89$\pm$2 within the error bars, making the possibility that this comet was an interstellar object unlikely.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars can explode in powerful supernovae (SNe) forming neutron stars but they may also collapse directly into black holes (BHs). Understanding and predicting their final fate is increasingly important, e.g, in the context of gravitational-wave astronomy. The interior mixing of stars in general and convective boundary mixing remain some of the largest uncertainties in their evolution. Here, we investigate the influence of convective boundary mixing on the pre-SN structure and explosion properties of massive stars. Using the 1D stellar evolution code Mesa, we model single, non-rotating stars of solar metallicity with initial masses of $5-70\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and convective core step-overshooting of $0.05-0.50H_\mathrm{P}$. Stars are evolved until the onset of iron core collapse, and the pre-SN models are exploded using a parametric, semi-analytic SN code. We use the compactness parameter to describe the interior structure of stars at core collapse. Larger convective core overshooting shifts the location of the compactness peak by $1-2\mathrm{M_\odot}$ to higher $M_\mathrm{CO}$. As the luminosity of the pre-SN progenitor is determined by $M_\mathrm{CO}$, we predict BH formation for progenitors with luminosities $5.35<\log(L/\mathrm{L_\odot})<5.50$ and $\log(L/\mathrm{L_\odot})>5.80$. The luminosity range of BH formation agrees well with the observed luminosity of the red supergiant star N6946BH1 that disappeared without a bright SN and likely collapsed into a BH. While some of our models in the luminosity range $\log(L/\mathrm{L_\odot})=5.1-5.5$ indeed collapse to form BHs, this does not fully explain the lack of observed SN~IIP progenitors at these luminosities, ie the missing red-supergiant problem. Convective core overshooting affects the BH masses, the pre-SN location of stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, the plateau luminosity and duration of SN~IIP lightcurves.[Abridged]
#### Modeling and Reduction of High Frequency Scatter Noise at LIGO  Livingston

 - **Abstract**
 The sensitivity of aLIGO detectors is adversely affected by the presence of noise caused by light scattering. Low frequency seismic disturbances can create higher frequency scattering noise adversely impacting the frequency band in which we detect gravitational waves. In this paper, we analyze instances of a type of scattered light noise we call "Fast Scatter" that is produced by motion at frequencies greater than 1 Hz, to locate surfaces in the detector that may be responsible for the noise. We model the phase noise to better understand the relationship between increases in seismic noise near the site and the resulting Fast Scatter observed. We find that mechanical damping of the Arm Cavity Baffles (ACBs) led to a significant reduction of this noise in recent data. For a similar degree of seismic motion in the 1-3 Hz range, the rate of noise transients is reduced by a factor of ~ 50.

 - **Abstract**
 Collisionless shock waves have long been considered amongst the most prolific particle accelerators in the universe. Shocks alter the plasma they propagate through and often exhibit complex evolution across multiple scales. Interplanetary (IP) traveling shocks have been recorded in-situ for over half a century and act as a natural laboratory for experimentally verifying various aspects of large-scale collisionless shocks. A fundamentally interesting problem in both helio and astrophysics is the acceleration of electrons to relativistic energies (more than 300 keV) by traveling shocks. This letter presents first observations of field-aligned beams of relativistic electrons upstream of an IP shock observed thanks to the instrumental capabilities of Solar Orbiter. This study aims to present the characteristics of the electron beams close to the source and contribute towards understanding their acceleration mechanism. On 25 July 2022, Solar Orbiter encountered an IP shock at 0.98 AU. The shock was associated with an energetic storm particle event which also featured upstream field-aligned relativistic electron beams observed 14 minutes prior to the actual shock crossing. The distance of the beam's origin was investigated using a velocity dispersion analysis (VDA). Peak-intensity energy spectra were anaylzed and compared with those obtained from a semi-analytical fast-Fermi acceleration model. By leveraging Solar Orbiter's high-time resolution Energetic Particle Detector (EPD), we have successfully showcased an IP shock's ability to accelerate relativistic electron beams. Our proposed acceleration mechanism offers an explanation for the observed electron beam and its characteristics, while we also explore the potential contributions of more complex mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers are broadly used for background-limited astrophysical measurements from the far-infrared to mm-waves. Many planned future instruments require increasingly large detector arrays, but their scalability is limited by their cryogenic readout electronics. Microwave SQUID multiplexing offers a highly capable scaling solution through the use of inherently broadband circuitry, enabling readout of hundreds to thousands of channels per microwave line. As with any multiplexing technique, the channelization mechanism gives rise to electrical crosstalk which must be understood and controlled so as to not degrade the instrument sensitivity. Here, we explore implications relevant for TES bolometer array applications, focusing in particular on upcoming mm-wave observatories such as the Simons Observatory and AliCPT. We model the relative contributions of the various underlying crosstalk mechanisms, evaluate the difference between fixed-tone and tone-tracking readout systems, and discuss ways in which crosstalk nonlinearity will complicate on-sky measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 The small-scale linear information in galaxy samples typically lost during non-linear growth can be restored to a certain level by the density field reconstruction, which has been demonstrated for improving the precision of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements. As proposed in the literature, a joint analysis of the power spectrum before and after the reconstruction enables an efficient extraction of information carried by high-order statistics. However, the statistics of the post-reconstruction density field are difficult to model. In this work, we circumvent this issue by developing an accurate emulator for the pre-reconstructed, post-reconstructed, and cross power spectra ($P_{\rm pre}$, $P_{\rm post}$, $P_{\rm cross}$) up to $k=0.5~h~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ based on the \textsc{Dark Quest} N-body simulations. The accuracy of the emulator is at percent level, namely, the error of the emulated monopole and quadrupole of the power spectra is less than $1\%$ and $5\%$ of the ground truth, respectively. A fit to an example power spectra using the emulator shows that the constraints on cosmological parameters get largely improved using $P_{\rm pre}$+$P_{\rm post}$+$P_{\rm cross}$ with $k_{\rm max}=0.25~h~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$, compared to that derived from $P_{\rm pre}$ alone, namely, the constraints on ($\Omega_m$, $H_0$, $\sigma_8$) are tightened by $\sim41 \%-55\%$, and the uncertainties of the derived BAO and RSD parameters ($\alpha_{\perp}$, $\alpha_{||}$, $f\sigma_8$) shrink by $\sim 28\%-54\%$, respectively. This highlights the complementarity among $P_{\rm pre}$, $P_{\rm post}$ and $P_{\rm cross}$, which demonstrates the efficiency and practicability of a joint $P_{\rm pre}$, $P_{\rm post}$ and $P_{\rm cross}$ analysis for cosmological implications.
#### A cross-bispectrum estimator for CMB-HI intensity mapping correlations

 - **Abstract**
 Intensity mapping of 21cm emission from neutral hydrogen (HI) promises to be a powerful probe of large-scale structure in the post-reionisation epoch. However, HI intensity mapping (IM) experiments will suffer the loss of long-wavelength line-of-sight HI modes in the galactic foreground subtraction process. The loss of these modes is particularly problematic for detecting HI IM cross-correlations with projected large-scale structure tracers, such as CMB secondary anisotropies. Here, we propose a cross-bispectrum estimator to recover the cross-correlation of the HI IM field, $\delta T_{21},$ with the CMB lensing field, $\kappa,$ constructed by correlating the position-dependent HI power spectrum with the mean overdensity traced by CMB lensing. We study the cross-bispectrum estimator, $B^{\bar \kappa \delta T_{21} \delta T_{21}},$ in the squeezed limit and forecast its detectability based on HI IM measurements from HIRAX and CMB lensing measurements from AdvACT. The cross-bispectrum improves constraints on cosmological parameters; in particular, the constraint on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, $w_0,$ improves on the HI IM auto-power spectra constraint by 44\% (to 0.014), while the constraint on $w_a$ improves by 33\% (to 0.08), assuming Planck priors in each case. These results are robust to HI IM foreground removal because they largely derive from small-scale HI modes. The HI-HI-$\kappa$ cross-bispectrum thus provides a novel way to recover HI correlations with CMB lensing and constrain cosmological parameters at a level that is competitive with next-generation galaxy redshift surveys. As a striking example of this, we find that the combined constraint on the sum of the neutrino masses, while varying all redshift and standard cosmological parameters within a $w_0w_a\Omega_K$CDM model, is 5.5 meV.
#### Direct Measurement of the Spectral Structure of Cosmic-Ray  Electrons+Positrons in the TeV Region with CALET on the International Space  Station

 - **Abstract**
 Detailed measurements of the spectral structure of cosmic-ray electrons and positrons from 10.6 GeV to 7.5 TeV are presented from over 7 years of observations with the CALorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET) on the International Space Station. Because of the excellent energy resolution (a few percent above 10 GeV) and the outstanding e/p separation (10$^5$), CALET provides optimal performance for a detailed search of structures in the energy spectrum. The analysis uses data up to the end of 2022, and the statistics of observed electron candidates has increased more than 3 times since the last publication in 2018. By adopting an updated boosted decision tree analysis, a sufficient proton rejection power up to 7.5 TeV is achieved, with a residual proton contamination less than 10%. The observed energy spectrum becomes gradually harder in the lower energy region from around 30 GeV, consistently with AMS-02, but from 300 to 600 GeV it is considerably softer than the spectra measured by DAMPE and Fermi-LAT. At high energies, the spectrum presents a sharp break around 1 TeV, with a spectral index change from -3.15 to -3.91, and a broken power law fitting the data in the energy range from 30 GeV to 4.8 TeV better than a single power law with 6.9 sigma significance, which is compatible with the DAMPE results. The break is consistent with the expected effects of radiation loss during the propagation from distant sources (except the highest energy bin). We have fitted the spectrum with a model consistent with the positron flux measured by AMS-02 below 1 TeV and interpreted the electron + positron spectrum with possible contributions from pulsars and nearby sources. Above 4.8 TeV, a possible contribution from known nearby supernova remnants, including Vela, is addressed by an event-by-event analysis providing a higher proton-rejection power than a purely statistical analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 In this proceeding we consider primordial black holes (PBHs) as a dark matter candidate. We discuss the existing limits on the fraction $f_{pbh}$ of the dark matter constituting of PBHs as a function of PBHs mass. The discussed limits cover almost all possible mass range with the currently only open window in $3\cdot 10^{16}-10^{18}$ g in which the PBHs can make up to 100% of the dark matter content of the universe. We present the estimates of the capabilities of the near-future instruments (Einstein Probe/WXT, SVOM/MXT) and discuss the potential of next-generation missions(Athena, THESEUS, eXTP) to probe this mass range. We discuss the targets most suitable for the PBH dark matter searches with these missions and the potential limiting factor of the systematics on the derived results.

 - **Abstract**
 We reveal properties of global modes of linear buoyancy instability in stars, characterised by the celebrated Schwarzschild criterion, using non-Hermitian topology. We identify a ring of Exceptional Points of order 4 that originates from the pseudo-Hermitian and pseudo-chiral symmetries of the system. The ring results from the merging of a dipole of degeneracy points in the Hermitian stablystratified counterpart of the problem. Its existence is related to spherically symmetric unstable modes. We obtain the conditions for which convection grows over such radial modes. Those are met at early stages of low-mass stars formation. We finally show that a topological wave is robust to the presence of convective regions by reporting the presence of a mode transiting between the wavebands in the non-Hermitian problem, strengthening their relevance for asteroseismology.

 - **Abstract**
 M60, an elliptical galaxy located 16.5~Mpc away, has an active nucleus with a very low luminosity and an extremely low accretion rate. Its central supermassive black hole has a mass of $M_{\rm BH}\sim4.5\times10^{9}\, M_{\odot}$ and a Schwarzschild radii corresponding to $R_{\rm S}\sim5.4\,\mu\mathrm{as}$. To investigate the nature of its innermost radio nucleus, data from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 4.4 and 7.6~GHz were reduced. The VLBA images reveal a compact component with total flux densities of $\sim$20~mJy at both frequencies, a size of $\leq$0.27~mas (99.7$\%$ confidence level), about 0.022~pc ($50\,R_{\rm S}$) at 7.6~GHz, and a brightness temperature of $\geq6\times10^{9}$~K. This suggests that the observed centi-parsec-scale compact core could be attributed to a nonthermal jet base or an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) with nonthermal electrons. The extremely compact structure also supports the presence of an SMBH in the center. Our results indicate that M60 is a promising target for broad-band VLBI observations at millimeter wavelengths to probe ADAF scenarios and tightly constrain the potential photon ring (about 28\,$\mu$as) around its SMBH.
#### The onset of stellar multiplicity in massive star formation: A search  for low-mass companions of massive young stellar objects with $L'$-band  adaptive optics imaging

 - **Abstract**
 Given the high incidence of binaries among mature field massive stars, it is clear that multiplicity is an inevitable outcome of high-mass star formation. Understanding how massive multiples form requires the study of the birth environments of massive stars, covering the innermost to outermost regions. We aim to detect and characterise low-mass companions around massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) during and shortly after their formation phase. To investigate large spatial scales, we carried out an $L'$-band high-contrast direct imaging survey seeking low-mass companions (down to $L_{\text{bol}}\approx 10 L_{\odot}$, or late A-type) around thirteen previously identified MYSOs using the VLT/NACO instrument. From those images, we looked for the presence of companions on a wide orbit, covering scales from 300 to 56,000 au. Detection limits were determined for all targets and we tested the gravitational binding to the central object based on chance projection probabilities. We have discovered a total of thirty-nine potential companions around eight MYSOs, the large majority of which have never been reported to date. We derived a multiplicity frequency (MF) of $62\pm13$% and a companion fraction (CF) of $3.0\pm0.5$. The derived MF and CF are compared to other studies for similar separation ranges. The comparisons are effective for a fixed evolutionary stage spanning a wide range of masses and vice versa. We find an increased MF and CF compared to the previous studies targeting MYSOs, showing that the statement in which multiplicity scales with primary mass also extends to younger evolutionary stages. The separations at which the companions are found and their location with relation to the primary star allow us to discuss the implications for the massive star formation theories.

 - **Abstract**
 ASTRI-Horn is the prototype of the nine telescopes that form the ASTRI Mini-Array, under construction at the Teide Observatory in Spain, devoted to observe the sky above 10 TeV. It adopts an innovative optical design based on a dual-mirror Schwarzschild-Couder configuration, and the camera, composed by a matrix of monolithic multipixel silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) is managed by ad-hoc tailored front-end electronics based on a peak-detector operation mode. During the Crab Nebula campaign in 2018-2019, ASTRI-Horn was affected by gain variations induced by high levels of night sky background. This paper reports the work performed to detect and quantify the effects of these gain variations in shower images. The analysis requested the use of simultaneous observations of the night sky background flux in the wavelength band 300-650 nm performed with the auxiliary instrument UVscope, a calibrated multi-anode photomultiplier working in single counting mode. As results, a maximum gain reduction of 15% was obtained, in agreement with the value previously computed from the variance of the background level in each image. This ASTRI-Horn gain reduction was caused by current limitation of the voltage supply. The analysis presented in this paper provides a method to evaluate possible variations in the nominal response of SiPMs when scientific observations are performed in the presence of high night sky background as in dark or gray conditions.

 Numerical models allow the investigation of phenomena that cannot exist in a laboratory. Computational simulations are therefore essential for advancing our knowledge of astrophysics, however, the very nature of simulation requires making assumptions that can substantially affect their outcome. Here, we present the challenges faced when simulating dim thermonuclear explosions, Type Iax supernovae. This class of dim events produce a slow moving, sparse ejecta that presents challenges for simulation. We investigate the limitations of the equation of state and its applicability to the expanding, cooling ejecta. We also discuss how the "fluff", i.e. the low-density gas on the grid in lieu of vacuum, inhibits the ejecta as it expands. We explore how the final state of the simulation changes as we vary the character of the burning, which influences the outcome of the explosion. These challenges are applicable to a wide range of astrophysical simulations, and are important to discuss and overcome as a community.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of supernova siblings, supernovae with the same host galaxy, is an important avenue for understanding and measuring the properties of Type Ia Supernova (SN Ia) light curves (LCs). Thus far, sibling analyses have mainly focused on optical LC data. Considering that LCs in the near-infrared (NIR) are expected to be better standard candles than those in the optical, we carry out the first analysis compiling SN siblings with only NIR data. We perform an extensive literature search of all SN siblings and find six sets of siblings with published NIR photometry. We calibrate each set of siblings ensuring they are on homogeneous photometric systems, fit the LCs with the SALT3-NIR and SNooPy models, and find median absolute differences in $\mu$ values between siblings of 0.248 mag and 0.186 mag, respectively. To evaluate the significance of these differences beyond measurement noise, we run simulations that mimic these LCs and provide an estimate for uncertainty on these median absolute differences of $\sim$0.052 mag, and we find that our analysis supports the existence of intrinsic scatter in the NIR at the 99% level. When comparing the same sets of SN siblings, we observe a median absolute difference in $\mu$ values between siblings of 0.177 mag when using optical data alone as compared to 0.186 mag when using NIR data alone. We attribute this to either limited statistics, poor quality NIR data, or poor reduction of the NIR data; all of which will be improved with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 The large-angular-scale falloff in the autocorrelation function for the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature has long intrigued cosmologists and fueled speculation about suppressed superhorizon power. Here we highlight an inconsistency between the temperature quadrupole and the more recently obtained E-mode polarization quadrupole from Planck PR3. The temperature quadrupole arises primarily at the CMB surface of last scatter, while the polarization primarily from the epoch of reionization, but the two still probe comparable distance scales. Although the temperature quadrupole is intriguingly low (much greater than a $1\sigma$ fluctuation) compared with that expected in the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, the polarization quadrupole turns out to be somewhat high, at the $1\sigma$ level. We calculate the joint probability distribution function for both and find a slight tension: the observed pair of quadrupoles is inconsistent at a $2.3\sigma$ confidence level. The problem is robust to simple changes to the cosmological model. If the high polarization quadrupole survives further scrutiny, then this result disfavors, at comparable significance, new superhorizon physics. The full-sky coverage and pristine foreground subtraction of the LiteBIRD satellite will be ideal to help resolve this question.

 - **Abstract**
 An accurate description of the center-to-limb variation (CLV) of stellar spectra is becoming an increasingly critical factor in both stellar and exoplanet characterization. In particular, the CLV of spectral lines is extremely challenging as its characterization requires highly detailed knowledge of the stellar physical conditions. To this end, we present the Numerical Empirical Sun-as-a-Star Integrator (NESSI) as a tool for translating high-resolution solar observations of a partial field of view into disk-integrated spectra that can be used to test common assumptions in stellar physics.
