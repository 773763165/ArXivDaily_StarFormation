 - **Abstract**
 Siril is a powerful open-source software package designed for the preprocessing and post-processing of astronomical images. It is particularly well-suited for astrophotography enthusiasts and professional astronomers alike. Siril provides advanced tools for tasks such as image stacking, calibration, registration, and enhancement, enabling users to produce high-quality images of celestial objects. The version discussed here is the development branch 1.4, which, while not officially released, is available for testing and includes the latest features and improvements.

          Intrinsic line profiles for X-ray fluorescent lines in SKIRT

 - **Abstract**
 We included the intrinsic line profiles of the strongest fluorescent lines in the X-ray radiative transfer code SKIRT to model the cold-gas structure and kinematics based on high-resolution line observations from XRISM/Resolve and Athena/X-IFU. The intrinsic line profiles of the Ka and Kb lines of Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu were implemented based on a multi-Lorentzian parameterisation and line energies are sampled from these Lorentzian components during the radiative transfer routine. In the optically thin regime, the SKIRT results match the intrinsic line profiles as measured in the laboratory. With a more complex 3D model that also includes kinematics, we find that the intrinsic line profiles are broadened and shifted to an extent that will be detectable with XRISM/Resolve; this model also demonstrates the importance of the intrinsic line shapes for constraining kinematics. We find that observed line profiles directly trace the cold-gas kinematics, without any additional radiative transfer effects. With the advent of the first XRISM/Resolve data, this update to the X-ray radiative transfer framework of SKIRT is timely and provides a unique tool for constraining the velocity structure of cold gas from X-ray microcalorimeter spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars with initial mass above roughly 8 solar masses will evolve to form a core made of iron group elements at which point no further exothermic nuclear reactions between charged nuclei may prevent the core collapse. Electron captures, neutrino losses, and the photo-disintegration of heavy nuclei trigger the collapse of these stars. Models at the brink of core collapse are produced using stellar evolution codes and these pre-collapse models may be used in the study of the subsequent dynamical evolution (including their explosion as supernovae and the formation of compact remnants such as neutron stars or black holes). We upgrade the physical ingredients employed by the GENeva stellar Evolution Code, GENEC, so that it may cover the regime of high temperatures and high densities required to produce progenitors of core-collapse. We have improved GENEC in three directions, equation of state, the nuclear reaction network and the radiative and conductive opacities adapted for the computation of the advanced phases of evolution. We produce a small grid of pre-supernova models of stars with zero-age main sequence masses of 15, 20 and 25 solar masses at solar and less than half solar metallicities. The results are compared with analogous models produced with the MESA code. The global properties of our new models, particularly of their inner cores, are comparable to models computed with MESA and pre-existing progenitors in the literature. Between codes the exact shell structure varies impacting explosion predictions. Using GENEC with state-of-the-art physics, we have produced massive stellar progenitors prior to collapse. These progenitors are suitable for follow-up studies, including the dynamical collapse and supernova phases. Larger grids of supernova progenitors are now feasible, with potential for further dynamical evolution.
#### Title:
          The Valuable Long-period Cluster Cepheid KQ Scorpii and other Calibration Candidates
 - **Authors:** Daniel Majaess, David G. Turner, Dante Minniti, Javier Alonso-Garcia, Roberto Saito
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 The classical Cepheid KQ Sco is a valuable anchor for the distance scale because of its long pulsation period ($28^{\rm d}.7$) and evidence implying membership in the open cluster UBC 1558. Analyses tied to Gaia DR3 astrometry, photometry, spectroscopy, radial velocities, and 2MASS-VVV photometry indicate a common distance of $2.15\pm0.15$ kpc (L21 DR3 corrections applied). Additional cluster Cepheid candidates requiring follow-up are identified, and it's suggested that a team of international researchers could maintain a cluster Cepheid database to guide the broader community to cases where consensus exists.

          The active role of co-evolving haloes in stellar bar formation

 - **Abstract**
 We use idealised N-body simulations of equilibrium discs in live and static haloes to study how dark matter co-evolution impacts the assembly of stellar particles into a bar and the halo response. Initial conditions correspond to a marginally unstable disc according to commonly used disc stability criteria, and are evolved for the equivalent of about 150 disc dynamical times (10Gyr). An extensive convergence study ensures accurate modelling of the bar formation process. Live haloes lead to the formation of a strong bar, but the same disc remains unbarred when evolved in a static halo. Neither seeded disc instabilities, nor longer (60Gyr) simulations result in the formation of a bar when the halo is static. When the live halo is replaced with a static analogue at later times the previously robust bar slowly dissipates, suggesting: (1) the co-evolution of the disc and halo is critical for the assembly and long-term survival of bars in marginally unstable discs; and (2) global disc stability criteria must be modified for discs in the presence of live haloes. In our live halo runs, a "dark bar" grows synchronously with the stellar bar. Processes that inhibit the transfer of angular momentum between the halo and disc may stabilise a galaxy against bar formation, and can lead to the dissolution of the bar itself. This raises further questions about the puzzling stability of observed discs that are marginally unstable, but unbarred.
#### Title:
          Spacecraft inertial parameters estimation using time series clustering and reinforcement learning

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a machine learning approach to estimate the inertial parameters of a spacecraft in cases when those change during operations, e.g. multiple deployments of payloads, unfolding of appendages and booms, propellant consumption as well as during in-orbit servicing and active debris removal operations. The machine learning approach uses time series clustering together with an optimised actuation sequence generated by reinforcement learning to facilitate distinguishing among different inertial parameter sets. The performance of the proposed strategy is assessed against the case of a multi-satellite deployment system showing that the algorithm is resilient towards common disturbances in such kinds of operations.

          A deeper investigation of the Primordial Binary Cluster

 - **Abstract**
 We hereby reported a new physical binary cluster (ASCC~19 and ASCC~21) near the Orion star-forming complex based on the data in the literature. Analysis of the results shows that it is a primordial binary cluster. It is possible that this binary cluster is undergoing two-body relaxation by inspecting the radial velocity anomalies of its member stars. In addition, based on the analysis of its metal abundances, we found that the components of this binary cluster may have been formed by the deep fusion of multiple subclusters. Finally, we investigated the 3D morphology of this binary cluster, simulated the trajectories of its components in the galactic disk, and concluded that its components may not merge into a single cluster.
#### Title:
          Two successive EUV waves and a transverse oscillation of a quiescent prominence

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we carry out multiwavelength observations of two successive extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) waves originating from active region (AR) NOAA 13575 and a transverse oscillation of a columnar quiescent prominence on 2024 February 9. A hot channel eruption generates an X3.4 class flare and the associated full-halo coronal mass ejection (CME), which drives the first EUV wave front (WF1) at a speed of $\sim$835 km s$^{-1}$. WF1 propagates in the southeast direction and interacts with the prominence, causing an eastward displacement of the prominence immediately. Then, a second EUV wave front (WF2) is driven by a coronal jet at a speed of $\sim$831 km s$^{-1}$. WF2 follows WF1 and decelerates from $\sim$788 km s$^{-1}$ to $\sim$603 km s$^{-1}$ before arriving at and touching the prominence. After reaching the maximum displacement, the prominence turns back and swings for 1$-$3 cycles. The transverse oscillation of horizontal polarization is most evident in 304 Å. The initial displacement amplitude, velocity in the plane of the sky, period, and damping time fall in the ranges of 12$-$34 Mm, 65$-$143 km s$^{-1}$, 18$-$27 minutes, and 33$-$108 minutes, respectively. There are strong correlations among the initial amplitude, velocity, period, and height of the prominence. Surprisingly, the oscillation is also detected in 1600 Å, which is totally in phase with that in 304 Å.

          Formation of WNL stars for the MW and LMC based on the k-omega model

 - **Abstract**
 We adopt a set of second-order differential equations ($k-\omega$ model) to handle core convective overshooting in massive stars, simulate the evolution of WNL stars with different metallicities and initial masses, both rotating and non-rotating models, and compare the results with the classical overshooting model. The results indicate that under the same initial conditions, the $k-\omega$ model generally produces larger convective cores and wider overshooting regions, thereby increasing the mass ranges and extending the lifetimes of WNL stars, as well as the likelihood of forming WNL stars. The masses and lifetimes of WNL stars both increase with higher metallicities and initial masses. Under higher-metallicity conditions, the two overshooting schemes significantly differ in their impacts on lifetimes of the WNL stars, but insignificant in the mass ranges of the WNL stars. Rotation may drive the formation of WNL stars in low-mass, metal-poor counterparts, with this effect being more pronounced in the OV model. The surface nitrogen of metal-rich WNL stars formed during the MS phase is likely primarily from the CN-cycle, while it may come from both the CN- and NO-cycles for relatively metal-poor counterparts. Our model can effectively explain the distribution of WNL stars in the Milky Way, but appears to have inadequacies in explaining the WNL stars in the LMC.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the abundance pattern of metal-poor stars and the production of heavy elements through various nucleosynthesis processes offers crucial insights into the chemical evolution of the Milky Way, revealing primary sites and major sources of rapid neutron-capture process ($r$-process) material in the Universe. In this fifth data release from the $R$-Process Alliance, we present the detailed chemical abundances of 41 faint (down to V = 15.8) and extremely metal-poor (down to [Fe/H] = -3.3) halo stars selected from the $R$-Process Alliance (RPA). We obtained high-resolution spectra for these objects with the HORuS spectrograph on the Gran Telescopio Canarias. We measure the abundances of light, alpha, Fe-peak, and neutron-capture elements. We report the discovery of five CEMP, one limited-$r$, three $r$-I, and four $r$-II stars, and six Mg-poor stars. We also identify one star of a possible globular cluster origin at an extremely low metallicity at [Fe/H] = -3.0. This adds to the growing evidence of a lower limit metallicity floor for globular cluster abundances. We use the abundances of Fe-peak elements and the alpha-elements to investigate the contributions from different nucleosynthesis channels in the progenitor supernovae. We find the distribution of [Mg/Eu] as a function of [Fe/H] to have different enrichment levels, indicating different possible pathways and sites of their production. We also reveal differences in the trends of the neutron-capture element abundances of Sr, Ba, and Eu of various r-I and r-II stars from the RPA data releases, which provide constraints on their nucleosynthesis sites and subsequent evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Sulphur-bearing species play crucial roles in interstellar chemistry, yet their precise characterisation remains challenging. Here, we present laboratory experiments aimed at extending the high-resolution spectroscopy of protonated carbonyl sulphide (HOCS$^+$), a recently detected molecular ion in space. Using a frequency-modulated free-space absorption spectrometer, we detected rotational transitions of HOCS$^+$ in an extended negative glow discharge with a mixture of H$_2$ and OCS, extending the high-resolution rotational characterisation of the cation well into the millimetre wave region (200-370 GHz). Comparisons with prior measurements and quantum chemical calculations revealed an overall agreement in the spectroscopic parameters. With the new spectroscopic dataset in hand, we re-investigated the observations of HOCS$^+$ towards G+0.693-0.027, which were initially based solely on K$_a$ = 0 lines contaminated by HNC$^{34}$S. This re-investigation enabled the detection of weak K$_a$ = 0 transitions, free from HNC$^{34}$S contamination. Our high-resolution spectroscopic characterisation also provides valuable insights for future millimetre and submillimetre astronomical observations of these species in different interstellar environments. In particular, the new high-resolution catalogue will facilitate the search for this cation in cold dark clouds, where very narrow line widths are typically observed.

          JWST-TST High Contrast: Spectroscopic Characterization of the Benchmark Brown Dwarf HD 19467 B with the NIRSpec Integral Field Spectrograph

 - **Abstract**
 We present the atmospheric characterization of the substellar companion HD 19467 B as part of the pioneering JWST GTO program to obtain moderate resolution spectra (R$\sim$2,700, 3-5$\mu$m) of a high-contrast companion with the NIRSpec IFU. HD 19467 B is an old, $\sim$9 Gyr, companion to a Solar-type star with multiple measured dynamical masses. The spectra show detections of CO, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and H$_2$O. We forward model the spectra using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and atmospheric model grids to constrain the effective temperature and surface gravity. We then use NEWERA-PHOENIX grids to constrain non-equilibrium chemistry parameterized by $K_{zz}$ and explore molecular abundance ratios of the detected molecules. We find an effective temperature of 1103 K, with a probable range from 1000--1200 K, a surface gravity of 4.50 dex, with a range of 4.14--5.00, and deep vertical mixing, log$_{10}$($K_{zz}$), of 5.03, with a range of 5.00--5.44. All molecular mixing ratios are approximately Solar, leading to a C/O $\sim$0.55, which is expected from a T5.5 brown dwarf. Finally, we calculate an updated dynamical mass of HD 19467 B using newly derived NIRCam astrometry which we find to be $71.6^{+5.3}_{-4.6} M_{\rm{Jup}}$, in agreement with the mass range we derive from evolutionary models, which we find to be 63-75 $M_{\rm{Jup}}$.These observations demonstrate the excellent capabilities of the NIRSpec IFU to achieve detailed spectral characterization of substellar companions at high-contrast close to bright host stars, in this case at a separation of $\sim$1.6\arcsec with a contrast of 10$^{-4}$ in the 3-5 $\mu$m range.

 - **Abstract**
 The Probe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) is a proposed space observatory which will use arrays of thousands of kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) to perform low- and moderate-resolution spectroscopy throughout the far-infrared. The detectors must have noise equivalent powers (NEPs) at or below 0.1 aW/sqrt(Hz) to be subdominant to noise from sky backgrounds and thermal noise from PRIMA's cryogenically cooled primary mirror. Using a Radio Frequency System on a Chip for multitone readout, we measure the NEPs of detectors on a flight-like array designed to observe at a wavelength of 210 microns. We find that 92% of the KIDs measured have an NEP below 0.1 aW/sqrt(Hz) at a noise frequency of 10 Hz.

 - **Abstract**
 The Planet Formation Imager (PFI) Project is dedicated to defining a next-generation facility that can answer fundamental questions about how planets form, including detection of young giant exoplanets and their circumplanetary disks. The proposed expansive design for a 12-element array of 8m class telescopes with >1.2 km baselines would indeed revolutionize our understanding of planet formation and is technically achievable, albeit at a high cost. It has been 10 years since this conceptual design process began and we give an overview of the status of the PFI project. We also review how a scaled back PFI with fewer large telescopes could answer a range of compelling science questions, including in planet formation and as well as totally different astrophysics areas. New opportunities make a space-based PFI more feasible now and we give a brief overview of new efforts that could also pave the way for the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) space mission.

          HOLISMOKES -- XIV. Time-delay and differential dust extinction determination with lensed type II supernova color curves

 - **Abstract**
 The Hubble tension is one of the most relevant unsolved problems in cosmology today. Strongly gravitationally lensed transient objects, such as strongly lensed supernovae, are an independent and competitive probe that can be used to determine the Hubble constant. In this context, the time delay between different images of lensed supernovae is a key ingredient. We present a method, to retrieve time delays and the amount of differential dust extinction between multiple images of lensed type IIP supernovae through their color curves, which display a kink in the time evolution. With multiple realistic mock color curves based on an observed unlensed supernova from the Carnegie Supernova Project, we demonstrate that we can retrieve the time delay with uncertainties of $\pm$1.0 days for light curves with 2-day cadence and 35% missing data due to weather losses. The differential dust extinction is more susceptible to uncertainties, because it depends on imposing the correct extinction law. Further we also investigate the kink structure in the color curves for different rest-frame wavelength bands, particularly rest-frame UV light curves from SWIFT, finding sufficiently strong kinks for our method to work for typical lensed SN redshifts that would redshift the kink feature to optical wavelengths. With the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, hundreds of strongly lensed supernovae will be detected and our new method for lensed SN IIP is readily applicable to provide delays.

 - **Abstract**
 The future of time-domain optical astronomy relies on the development of techniques and software capable of handling a rising amount of data and gradually complementing, or replacing if necessary, real observations. Next generation surveys, like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), will open the door to the new era of optical astrophysics, creating, at the same time, a deficiency in spectroscopic data necessary to confirm the nature of each event and to fully recover the parametric space. In this framework, we developed Core collApse Supernovae parameTers estimatOR (CASTOR), a novel software for data analysis. CASTOR combines Gaussian Process and other Machine Learning techniques to build time-series templates of synthetic spectra and to estimate parameters of core collapse supernovae for which only multi-band photometry is available. Techniques to build templates are fully data driven and non-parametric through empirical and robust models, and rely on the direct comparison with a training set of 111 core collapse supernovae from the literature. Furthermore, CASTOR employees the real photometric data and the reconstructed synthetic spectra of an event to estimate parameters that belong to the supernova ejecta, to the stellar progenitor and to the event itself, in a rapid and user-friendly framework. In this work we provide a demonstration of how CASTOR works, studying available data from SN2015ap and comparing our results with those available in literature.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the concept for STARI: STarlight Acquisition and Reflection toward Interferometry. If launched, STARI will be the first mission to control a 3-D CubeSat formation to the few mm-level, reflect starlight over 10s to 100s of meters from one spacecraft to another, control tip-tilt with sub-arcsecond stability, and validate end-to-end performance by injecting light into a single-mode fiber. While STARI is not an interferometer, the mission will advance the Technology Readiness Levels of the essential subsystems needed for a space interferometer in the near future.
