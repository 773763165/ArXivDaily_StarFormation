 - **Abstract**
 It is assumed that heavy dark matter $\phi$ with O(TeV) mass captured by the Earth may decay to relativistic light milli-charged particles (MCPs). These MCPs could be measured by the IceCube neutrino telescope. The massless hidden photon model was taken for MCPs to interact with nuclei, so that the numbers and fluxes of expected MCPs may be evaluated at IceCube. Meanwhile, the numbers of expected neutrino background events were also evaluated at IceCube. Based on the assumption that no events are observed at IceCube in 10 years, the corresponding upper limits on MCP fluxes were calculated at 90\% C. L.. These results indicated that the MCPs from the Earth's core could be directly detected at O(1TeV) energies at IceCube when $2\times10^{-5}\lesssim\epsilon^2\lesssim4.5\times10^{-3}$. And a new region of 100 MeV < $m_{MCP}$ < 10 GeV and $4.47\times10^{-3}$ $\lesssim$ $\epsilon$ $\lesssim$ $9.41\times10^{-2}$ is ruled out in the $m_{MCP}$-$\epsilon$ plane with 10 years of IceCube data.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the Bower-Liang model, we discuss how pressure anisotropies affect the microscopic and macroscopic properties of hybrid stars. We find that anisotropies affect the maximum mass, central density, and radius of the canonical stars. Anisotropies also affect the minimum neutron star mass that presents quarks in their core, as well as the total amount of quarks for the maximally massive stars. We also confront our results with standard constraints, such as the radius and the tidal parameter of the canonical star, as well as the mass and radius of the PSR J0740+6620 pulsar. We observe that moderate values for anisotropies could fulfill these constraints simultaneously. On the other hand, within more extreme degrees of anisotropies, more speculative constraints such as black widow pulsars PSR J0952-0607 and the mass-gap object in the GW190814 event can be explained as hybrid stars. We also investigate the role of anisotropies in the neutron stars' moment of inertia.

 - **Abstract**
 The Hubble Space Telescope has devoted 500 orbits to observing 250 massive stars with low metallicity in the ultraviolet (UV) range within the framework of the ULLYSES program. The X-Shooting ULLYSES (XShootU) project enhances the legacy value of this UV dataset by providing high-quality optical and near-infrared spectra, which are acquired using the wide-wavelength-coverage X-shooter spectrograph at ESO's Very Large Telescope. XShootU emphasises the importance of combining UV with optical spectra for the consistent determination of key stellar parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, luminosity, abundances, and wind characteristics including mass-loss rates as a function of metallicity. Since uncertainties in these parameters have implications across various branches of astrophysics, the data and modelling generated by the XShootU project are poised to significantly advance our understanding of massive stars at low metallicity. This is particularly crucial for confidently interpreting JWST data of the earliest stellar generations, making XShootU a unique resource for comprehending individual spectra of low-metallicity stars.
#### NICER Discovery of the Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsar SRGA  J144459.2-604207

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery, with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), of the 447.9 Hz accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar (AMXP) SRGA J144459.2-604207, which underwent a four-week long outburst starting on 2024 February 15. The AMXP resides in a 5.22 hr binary, orbiting a low-mass companion donor with $M_d>0.1M_\odot$. We report on the temporal and spectral properties from NICER observations during the early days of the outburst, from 2024 February 21 through 2024 February 23, during which NICER also detected a type-I X-ray burst that exhibited a plateau lasting ~6 s. The spectra of the persistent emission were well described by an absorbed thermal blackbody and power-law model, with blackbody temperature $kT\approx0.9{\rm\,keV}$ and power-law photon index $\Gamma\approx1.9$. Time-resolved burst spectroscopy confirmed the thermonuclear nature of the burst, where an additional blackbody component reached a maximum temperature of nearly $kT\approx3{\rm\,keV}$ at the peak of the burst. We discuss the nature of the companion as well as the type-I X-ray burst.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation estimates based on the counting of YSOs is commonly applied to nearby star-forming regions in the Galaxy. With this method, the SFRs are measured using the counts of YSOs in a particular protostellar Class, a typical protostellar mass, and the lifetime associated with this Class. However, the assumptions underlying the validity of the method such as that of a constant star formation history (SFH) and whether the method is valid for all protostellar Classes has never been fully tested. In this work, we use Monte Carlo models to test the validity of the method. We build synthetic clusters in which stars form at times that are randomly drawn from a specified SFH. The latter is either constant or time-dependent with a burst like behavior. The masses of the protostars are randomly drawn from an IMF which can be either similar to that of the Milky Way field or be variable . For each star in every cluster, the lifetimes associated with the different protostellar classes are also randomly drawn from Gaussian distribution functions centered around their most likely value as suggested by the observations. We find that only the SFR derived using the Class 0 population can reproduce the true SFR at all epochs, and this is true irrespective of the shape of the SFH. For a constant SFH, the SFR derived using the more evolved populations of protostars (Classes I, F, II, and III) reproduce the real SFR only at later epochs which correspond to epochs at which their numbers have reached a steady state. For a time-dependent burst-like SFH, all SFR estimates based on the number counts of the evolved populations fail to reproduce the true SFR. We also show how the offsets between Class I and Class II based SFRs and the true SFR plotted as a function of the number ratios of Class I and Class II versus Class III YSOs can be used in order to constrain the SFH of observed molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 The most metal-poor stars provide valuable insights into the early chemical enrichment history of a system, carrying the chemical imprints of the first generations of supernovae. The most metal-poor region of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy remains inadequately observed and characterised. To date, only a handful of stars with [Fe/H]$<-2.0$ have been chemically analysed with high-resolution spectroscopy. In this study, we present the most extensive chemical abundance analysis of 12 low-metallicity stars with metallicities down to [Fe/H]$=-3.26$ and located in the main body of Sagittarius. These targets, selected from the Pristine Inner Galaxy survey, were observed using the MIKE high-resolution spectrograph at the Magellan-Clay telescope, which allows us to measure up to 17 chemical species. The chemical composition of these stars reflects the imprint of a variety of type~II supernovae. A combination of low- to intermediate-mass core-collapse and hypernovae ($\sim10-70 M_{\odot}$) is required to account for the abundance patterns of the lighter elements up to the Fe-peak. The trend of the heavy elements suggests the involvement of compact binary merger events and fast-rotating (up to $\sim300$ km s$^{-1}$) intermediate-mass to massive metal-poor stars ($\sim25-120 M_{\odot}$) that are the sources of rapid- and slow-processes, respectively. Additionally, asymptotic giant branch stars contribute to a wide dispersion of [Ba/Mg] and [Ba/Eu]. The absence of an $\alpha-$knee in our data indicates that type Ia supernovae did not contribute in the very metal-poor region ( [Fe/H]$\leq-2.0$). However, they might have started to pollute the interstellar medium at [Fe/H]$>-2.0$, given the relatively low [Co/Fe] in this metallicity region.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of the end stages of reionization indicate that at $z\approx 5-6$, the ionizing background is not uniform and the mean free path (MFP) changes drastically. As MFP is closely related to the distribution of Lyman Limit Systems and Damped Lyman-alpha Systems (LLSs and DLAs, or ionizing photon "sinks"), it is important to understand them. In this study, we utilize the CROC simulations, which have both sufficient spatial resolution to resolve galaxy formation and LLSs alongside a fully coupled radiative transfer to simulate the reionization processes. In our analysis, we connect the evolution of the ionizing background and the MFP. We analyze two CROC boxes with distinct reionization histories and find that the distribution of ionizing background in both simulations display significant skewness that deviate from log-normal. Further, the ionizing background in late reionization box still displays significant fluctuations ($\sim 40\%$) at $z\approx5$. We also measure the MFP along sightlines that start 0.15 pMpc away from the center of potential quasar hosting halos. The evolution of the MFP measured from these sightlines exhibits a break that coincides with when all the neutral islands disappear in the reionization history of each box (the `ankle' of the reionization history of the box). In the absence of LLSs, the MFP will be biased high by $\approx 20\%$ at $z\approx 5$. We also compare the MFP measured in random sightlines. We find that at $z\approx 5$ the MFP measured in sightlines that start from massive halos are systematically smaller by $\approx 10\%$ compared with the MFP measured in random sightlines. We attribute this difference to the concentration of dense structures within 1 pMpc from massive halos. Our findings highlight the importance of high fidelity models in the interpretation of observational measurements.
#### OCCASO V. Chemical-abundance trends with Galactocentric distance and age

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Open clusters provide valuable information on stellar nucleosynthesis and the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc, as their age and distances can be measured more precisely with photometry than for field stars. Aims. Our aim is to study the chemical distribution of the Galactic disc using open clusters by analysing the existence of gradients with Galactocentric distance, azimuth or height from the plane and dependency with age. Methods. High-resolution spectra (R>60 000) of 194 stars belonging to 36 open clusters are used to determine atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances with two independent methods: equivalent widths and spectral synthesis. The sample has been complemented with 63 clusters with high-resolution spectroscopy from literature. Results. We measure local thermodynamic equilibrium abundances for 21 elements: {\alpha} (Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti), odd-Z (Na and Al), Fe-peak (Fe, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn), and neutron-capture (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, Ce, and Nd). We also provide non-local thermodynamic equilibrium abundances for elements when corrections are available. We find inner disc young clusters enhanced in [Mg/Fe] and [Si/Fe] compared to other clusters of their age. For [Ba/Fe] we report an age trend flattening for older clusters (age<2.5 Ga). The studied elements follow the expected radial gradients as a function of their nucleosynthesis groups, which are significantly steeper for the oldest systems. For the first time, we investigate the existence of an azimuthal gradient, finding some hints of its existence among the old clusters (age>2 Ga).

 - **Abstract**
 We present extensive observations of the Type II supernova (SN II) 2023ufx which is likely the most metal-poor SN II observed to-date. It exploded in the outskirts of a low-metallicity ($Z_{\rm host} \sim 0.1~Z_\odot$) dwarf ($M_g = -13.23\pm0.15$~mag; $r_e\sim 1$~kpc) galaxy. The explosion is luminous, peaking at $M_g\approx -18.5~$mag, and shows rapid evolution. The $r$-band (pseudo-bolometric) light curve has a shock-cooling phase lasting 20 (17) days followed by a 19 (23)-day plateau. The entire optically-thick phase lasts only $\approx 55~$days following explosion, indicating that the red supergiant progenitor had a thinned H envelope prior to explosion. The early spectra obtained during the shock-cooling phase show no evidence for narrow emission features and limit the pre-explosion mass-loss rate to $\dot{M} \lesssim 10^{-3}~\rm M_\odot$/yr. The photospheric-phase spectra are devoid of prominent metal absorption features, indicating a progenitor metallicity of $\lesssim 0.1~Z_\odot$. The semi-nebular ($\sim 60-130~$d) spectra reveal weak Fe II, but other metal species typically observed at these phases (Ti II, Sc II, Ba II) are conspicuously absent. The late-phase optical and near-infrared spectra also reveal broad ($\approx 10^4~\rm{km}~\rm s^{-1}$) double-peaked H$\alpha$, P$\beta$, and P$\gamma$ emission profiles suggestive of a fast outflow launched during the explosion. Outflows are typically attributed to rapidly-rotating progenitors which also prefer metal-poor environments. This is only the second SN II with $\lesssim 0.1~Z_\odot$ and both exhibit peculiar evolution, suggesting a sizable fraction of metal-poor SNe II have distinct properties compared to nearby metal-enriched SNe II. These observations lay the groundwork for modeling the metal-poor SNe II expected in the early Universe.
#### Neural network based emulation of galaxy power spectrum covariances -- A  reanalysis of BOSS DR12 data

 - **Abstract**
 We train neural networks to quickly generate redshift-space galaxy power spectrum covariances from a given parameter set (cosmology and galaxy bias). This covariance emulator utilizes a combination of traditional fully-connected network layers and transformer architecture to accurately predict covariance matrices for the high redshift, north galactic cap sample of the BOSS DR12 galaxy catalog. We run simulated likelihood analyses with emulated and brute-force computed covariances, and we quantify the network's performance via two different metrics: 1) difference in $\chi^2$ and 2) likelihood contours for simulated BOSS DR 12 analyses. We find that the emulator returns excellent results over a large parameter range. We then use our emulator to perform a re-analysis of the BOSS HighZ NGC galaxy power spectrum, and find that varying covariance with cosmology along with the model vector produces $\Omega_m = 0.276^{+0.013}_{-0.015}$, $H_0 = 70.2\pm 1.9$ km/s/Mpc, and $\sigma_8 = 0.674^{+0.058}_{-0.077}$. These constraints represent an average $0.46\sigma$ shift in best-fit values and a $5\%$ increase in constraining power compared to fixing the covariance matrix ($\Omega_m = 0.293\pm 0.017$, $H_0 = 70.3\pm 2.0$ km/s/Mpc, $\sigma_8 = 0.702^{+0.063}_{-0.075}$). This work demonstrates that emulators for more complex cosmological quantities than second-order statistics can be trained over a wide parameter range at sufficiently high accuracy to be implemented in realistic likelihood analyses.
#### Primordial Black Hole Formation in a Dust Bouncing Model

 - **Abstract**
 Linear scalar cosmological perturbations have increasing spectra in the contracting phase of bouncing models. We study the conditions for which these perturbations may collapse into primordial black holes and the hypothesis that these objects constitute a fraction of dark matter. We compute the critical density contrast that describes the collapse of matter perturbations in the flat-dust bounce model with a parametric solution, obtained from the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi metric that represents the spherical collapse. We discuss the inability of the Newtonian gauge to describe perturbations in contracting models as the perturbative hypothesis does not hold in such cases. We carry the calculations for a different Gauge choice and compute the perturbations power spectra numerically. Finally, assuming a Gaussian distribution, we compute the primordial black hole abundance with the Press-Schechter formalism and compare it with observational constraints. From our analysis, we conclude that the primordial black hole formation in a dust-dominated contracting phase does not lead to a significant mass fraction of primordial black holes in dark matter today.
#### The relationship between the turnover frequency and photo-ionisation in  radio sources

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00257
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00257
 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the connection between the turnover frequency in the radio spectrum, $\nu_{\rm TO}$, and the rate of ionising ultra-violet photons, $Q_{\rm HI}$, in extragalactic sources. From a large, optically selected, sample we find $\nu_{\rm TO}$ to be correlated with $Q_{\rm HI}$ in sources which exhibit a turnover. The significance of the correlation decreases when we include power-law radio sources as limits, by assuming that the turnover frequency occurs below the lowest value observed. However, the power-law fit sources are less well sampled across the band and so these may just be contributing noise to the data. Given that the observed $\nu_{\rm TO}$--$Q_{\rm HI}$ correlation is purely empirical, we use the ionising photon rate to obtain the electron density in a free-free absorption model. For each of the constant, exponential, constant plus exponential (Milky Way) and spherical models of the gas distribution, there is also an increase in the turnover frequency with ionising photon rate. Furthermore, for a given gas mass, we find that the turnover frequency is anti-correlated with the scale-factor of the gas density. While other mechanisms, such as ageing electrons or synchrotron self-absorption, may be required to reproduce the spectral indices, for an exponential scale-factor similar to the linear size, this simple free-free absorption model reproduces the turnover-size correlation seen in radio sources.
#### Informed Total-Error-Minimizing Priors: Interpretable cosmological  parameter constraints despite complex nuisance effects

 - **Abstract**
 While Bayesian inference techniques are standard in cosmological analyses, it is common to interpret resulting parameter constraints with a frequentist intuition. This intuition can fail, e.g. when marginalizing high-dimensional parameter spaces onto subsets of parameters, because of what has come to be known as projection effects or prior volume effects. We present the method of Informed Total-Error-Minimizing (ITEM) priors to address this. An ITEM prior is a prior distribution on a set of nuisance parameters, e.g. ones describing astrophysical or calibration systematics, intended to enforce the validity of a frequentist interpretation of the posterior constraints derived for a set of target parameters, e.g. cosmological parameters. Our method works as follows: For a set of plausible nuisance realizations, we generate target parameter posteriors using several different candidate priors for the nuisance parameters. We reject candidate priors that do not accomplish the minimum requirements of bias (of point estimates) and coverage (of confidence regions among a set of noisy realizations of the data) for the target parameters on one or more of the plausible nuisance realizations. Of the priors that survive this cut we select the ITEM prior as the one that minimizes the total error of the marginalized posteriors of the target parameters. As a proof of concept, we apply our method to the Density Split Statistics (DSS) measured in Dark Energy Survey Year 1 data. We demonstrate that the ITEM priors substantially reduce prior volume effects that otherwise arise and allow sharpened yet robust constraints on the parameters of interest.
#### Near Infrared Diffuse Interstellar Bands Characterized by Fullerene and  Graphene Molecules

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomical near-infrared Diffuse-Interstellar-Bands (DIBs) were characterized by pure carbon Fullerene and Graphene molecules comparing with laboratory experiment and with Time-Dependent Density-Functional-Theory (TD-DFT) analysis. It is well known that two large DIBs of Fullerene cation (C60)+ at 9577A and 9632A coincide well with laboratory experiments. Those are thought to be split bands by the Jahn-Teller molecular deformation. In our TD-DFT calculation, those are reproduced by degenerated bands at 9549A and 9552A before deformation. Cation enriching experiment by Strelnikov et al. suggested longer wavelength two bands of DIB10542 and DIB10610 (observed by Hamano et al.), which may split from calculated 10410A and 10411A. Also, we noticed shorter wavelength experimental band around 8550A, which may relate to calculated 8677A and 8686A. We challenged such analysis on Graphene molecules as like (C54) (C53) (C52) and (C51), which are carbon hexagon and pentagon combined molecules. Calculation could reproduce many near-infrared bands. Calculated bands of (C54) suggest that one DIB among (DIB9577, DIB9632, or DIB9673) may correspond to one of (DIB10361, DIB10394, or DIB10439). Calculated bands of (C51) suggest that one of (DIB9686, DIB9987, or DIB10006) may relate to one of (DIB10262 or DIB10288). Combining astronomical observation, laboratory experiment, and quantum chemical analysis, we could suggest carrier candidates of DIBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Trends in the enrichment of elements with stellar ages are a powerful avenue to identify unexplained origins of the elements. We investigate the stellar abundance trends of low to intermediate-mass stars using the GALAH DR3 high-resolution spectroscopic dataset of 6234 solar-type stars. Our study explores the elemental abundance [X/Fe] of sodium (Na) with age. We find a pronounced enrichment in [Na/Fe] at super solar metallicity (i.e., [Fe/H] above 0) in the old sequence of Milky Way disc stars, a trend demanding a deeper understanding of the underlying source(s) responsible for the nucleosynthesis. This progressive [Na/Fe] enrichment at the young end of the old sequence has essential implications for Galactic archaeology. In this work, we propose a novel selection technique for separating the Milky Way's thick and thin disc stellar populations (i.e., old and young sequences) based on the observed [Na/Fe] rise of roughly 0.1 dex for stars around 5 - 8 Gyr old. We also compare our selection method to the conventional [Mg/Fe] vs [Fe/H] selection approach, and we find that our new Na-based selection method better disentangles the overlap between young- and old-sequence disc stars at these intermediate ages. This is especially true at super solar [Fe/H], where [Mg/Fe] vs [Fe/H] or [alpha/Fe] vs [Fe/H] separation approaches exhibit a lot of overlap. This new selection method should help us better understand the Milky Way disc's formation history.

 - **Abstract**
 The elemental abundance of ICMEs and solar wind near 1 au is often adopted to represent the abundance in the corresponding coronal sources. However, the absolute abundance of heavy ions (relative to hydrogen) near 1 au might be different from the coronal abundance due to the ion-proton differential speed ($V_{ip}$). To illustrate the $V_{ip}$ characteristics and explore whether it influences the absolute abundance analysis for ICMEs and solar wind, we perform a statistical study on the $V_{ip}$ for He$^{2+}$, C$^{5+}$, O$^{6+}$, and Fe$^{10+}$ in both ICMEs and solar wind based on measurements of Advanced Composition Explorer. The results show that the $V_{ip}$ is negligible within ICMEs and slow solar wind ($<$ 400 km s$^{-1}$), while obvious in the intermediate (400 -- 600 km s$^{-1}$) and fast wind ($>$ 600 km s$^{-1}$). Previous studies showed that the $V_{ip}$ in ICMEs keeps negligible during propagation from 0.3 to 5 au, but in solar wind it increases with the decreasing heliocentric distance. Therefore, it might be questionable to infer the absolute abundance of coronal sources through in-situ abundance near 1 au for solar wind. Fortunately, the ion-oxygen (O$^{6+}$) differential speed ($V_{io}$) is negligible for He$^{2+}$, C$^{5+}$, and Fe$^{10+}$ within both ICMEs and solar wind, and previous studies suggested that the $V_{io}$ does not vary significantly with the heliocentric distance. This indicates that various heavy ions always flow at the same bulk speed and their relative abundance (relative to oxygen) near 1 au can represent the coronal abundance for both ICMEs and solar wind.

 - **Abstract**
 Crystalline silicates are an important tracer to the dust evolution in protoplanetary disks. In the inner disk, amorphous silicates are annealed by the high temperatures. These crystalline silicates are radially and vertically distributed in the disk. We aim to model the spatial distribution of crystalline silicate in the disk and its mid-IR spectra to study the effect on dust spectral features and to compare these to observations. We modeled a T-Tauri protoplanetary disk and defined the crystallization region from the crystallization and residence timescales. Radial mixing and drift were compared to find a vertically mixed region. We used the DISKLAB code to obtain the spatial distribution of the crystalline silicates, and MCMax code to model the mid-infrared spectrum. In our modeled disk, different grain sizes get crystallized in different regions in the disk. Crystallized dust in the disk surface is well mixed with the midplane due to vertical mixing and gets distributed to the outer disk by radial transport. Our model shows different contributions of the disk zones to the dust spectral features. Feature strengths change when varying the spatial distribution of crystalline dust. Our modeled spectra qualitatively agree with observations, but the modeled 10 $\mu$m feature is strongly dominated by crystalline dust. Models with reduced crystallinity and depletion of small crystalline dust in the inner disk show a better match with observations. Mid-IR observations of the disk surface represent the radial distribution of small dust in the midplane and provide us with dust properties in the inner disk. The inner and outer disks contribute more to shorter and longer wavelength features, respectively. Amorphization, sublimation, and dust evolution have to be considered to match observations. This study could interpret the spectra of protoplanetary disks taken with the MIRI on board the JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 Synchrotron emissivities, absorptivities, and Faraday rotation and conversion coefficients are needed in modeling a variety of astrophysical sources, including Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) sources. We develop a method for estimating transfer coefficients that exploits their linear dependence on the electron distribution function, decomposing the distribution function into a sum of parts each of whose emissivity can be calculated easily. We refer to this procedure as stochastic averaging and apply it in two contexts. First, we use it to estimate the emissivity of an isotropic $\kappa$ distribution function with a high energy cutoff. The resulting coefficients can be evaluated efficiently enough to be used directly in ray-tracing calculations, and we provide an example calculation. Second, we use stochastic averaging to assess the effect of subgrid turbulence on the volume-averaged emissivity and along the way provide a prescription for a turbulent emissivity. We find that for parameters appropriate to EHT sources turbulence reduces the emissivity slightly. In the infrared turbulence can dramatically increase the emissivity.
#### Using non-DESI data to confirm and strengthen the DESI 2024  spatially-flat $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological parameterization result

 - **Abstract**
 We use a combination of Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data and non-CMB data that include Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, Hubble parameter [$H(z)$], growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, and a collection of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, but not recent DESI 2024 BAO measurements, to confirm the DESI 2024 (DESI+CMB+PantheonPlus) data compilation support for dynamical dark energy with an evolving equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$. From our joint compilation of CMB and non-CMB data, in a spatially-flat cosmological model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.850 \pm 0.059$ and $w_a = -0.59^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$ and find that this dynamical dark energy is favored over a cosmological constant by $\sim 2\sigma$. Our data constraints on the flat $w_0w_a$CDM model are slightly more restrictive than the DESI 2024 constraints, with the DESI 2024 and our values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ differing by $-0.27\sigma$ and $0.44\sigma$, respectively. Our data compilation slightly more strongly favors the flat $w_0w_a$CDM model over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model than does the DESI 2024 data compilation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a search for Miras and long-period variables (LPVs) in M33 using griJHKs archival observations from the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope. We use multiband information and machine learning techniques to identify and characterize these variables. We recover ~1,300 previously-discovered Mira candidates and identify ~13,000 new Miras and LPVs. We detect for the first time a clear first-overtone pulsation sequence among Mira candidates in this galaxy. We use O-rich, fundamental-mode Miras in the LMC and M33 to derive a distance modulus for the latter of 24.629 +/- 0.046 mag.

 - **Abstract**
 The fate of ultralight black holes depends on whether or not evaporation stops at or around the Planck scale. If evaporation stops, the general expectation is that a population of Planck-scale will be left over, possibly including a significant fraction of electrically charged relics. If evaporation does not stop, a runaway "explosion" would occur, with significant and potentially detectable high-energy emission. Here, I review both possibilities, with an emphasis on current status and future detection prospects.
#### Applying the starquake model to study the formation of elastic mountains  on spinning neutron stars

 - **Abstract**
 When a neutron star is spun-up or spun-down, the changing strains in its solid elastic crust can give rise to sudden fractures known as starquakes. Early interest in starquakes focused on their possible connection to pulsar glitches. While modern glitch models rely on pinned superfluid vorticity rather than crustal fracture, starquakes may nevertheless play a role in the glitch mechanism. Recently, there has been interest in the issue of starquakes resulting in non-axisymmetric shape changes, potentially linking the quake phenomenon to the building of neutron star mountains, which would then produce continuous gravitational waves. Motivated by this issue, we present a simple model that extends the energy minimisation-based calculations, originally developed to model axisymmetric glitches, to also include non-axisymmetric shape changes. We show that the creation of a mountain in a quake necessarily requires a change in the axisymmetric shape too. We apply our model to the specific problem of the spin-up of an initially non-rotating star, and estimate the maximum mountain that can be built in such a process, subject only to the constraints of energy and angular momentum conservation.
#### Contribution of PRIDE VLBI products to the joint JUICE-Europa Clipper  moons' ephemerides solution

 - **Abstract**
 In the coming decade, JUICE and Europa Clipper radio-science will yield the most accurate estimation to date of the Galilean moons' physical parameters and ephemerides. JUICE's PRIDE (Planetary Radio Interferometry and Doppler Experiment) will help achieve such a solution by providing VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) observations of the spacecraft's lateral position, complementing nominal radio-science measurements. We quantify how PRIDE VLBI can contribute to the moons' ephemerides determination, in terms of attainable solution improvement and validation opportunities. To this end, we simulated both single- and dual-spacecraft VLBI, exploiting the potential simultaneous tracking of JUICE and Europa Clipper. We considered various tracking and data quality scenarios, and compared the formal uncertainties obtained with and without VLBI. This was performed for both global and local (i.e., per-flyby) estimations of the moons' states, as achieving a global solution first requires proceeding arc-per-arc. We showed that both single- and dual-spacecraft VLBI only bring limited improvement to the global state estimation, but significantly contribute to the moons' normal points (i.e., local states at flyby times), most notably in the out-of-plane direction. Additionally, we designed a validation plan exploiting PRIDE VLBI to progressively validate the classical radio-science solution. By improving the local state estimations and offering various validation opportunities, PRIDE will be invaluable in overcoming possible dynamical modelling challenges. It can therefore play a key role in reconstructing a global solution for the Galilean moons' dynamics with the uncertainty levels promised by JUICE-Europa Clipper analyses. This, in turn, is critical to the accurate characterisation of tidal dissipation in the Jovian system, holding the key to the long-term evolution of the Galilean moons.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of debris disks offer important insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems. Though M dwarfs make up approximately 80% of nearby stars, very few M-dwarf debris disks have been studied in detail -- making it unclear how or if the information gleaned from studying debris disks around more massive stars extends to the more abundant M dwarf systems. We report the first scattered-light detection of the debris disk around the M4 star Fomalhaut C using JWST's Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam; 3.6$~\mu$m and 4.4$~\mu$m). This result adds to the prior sample of only four M-dwarf debris disks with detections in scattered light, and marks the latest spectral type and oldest star among them. The size and orientation of the disk in these data are generally consistent with the prior ALMA sub-mm detection. Though no companions are identified, these data provide strong constraints on their presence -- with sensitivity sufficient to recover sub-Saturn mass objects in the vicinity of the disk. This result illustrates the unique capability of JWST for uncovering elusive M-dwarf debris disks in scattered light, and lays the groundwork for deeper studies of such objects in the 2--5$~\mu$m regime.

 - **Abstract**
 In this letter we investigate new constraints on $f(T)$ gravity using the recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) catalog from the full 5-years of the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN5YR). The $f(T)$ cosmological models considered are characterised by power law late-time accelerated expansion. Our results show that the combination DESI BAO +$r_d$ CMB Planck suggests a Bayesian preference for late-time $f(T)$ cosmological models over $\Lambda$CDM, obtaining a value of $H_0=72.4\pm 2.9$[km/s/Mpc] in agreement with SH0ES collaboration.

 - **Abstract**
 Most stars are born in stellar clusters and their protoplanetary disks, which are the birthplaces of planets, can therefore be affected by the radiation of nearby massive stars. However, little is known about the chemistry of externally irradiated disks, including whether or not their properties are similar to the so-far better-studied isolated disks. Motivated by this question, we present ALMA Band 6 observations of two irradiated Class II protoplanetary disks in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) to explore the chemical composition of disks exposed to (external) FUV radiation fields: the 216-0939 disk and the binary system 253-1536A/B, which are exposed to radiation fields of $10^2-10^3$ times the average interstellar radiation field. We detect lines from CO isotopologues, HCN, H$_2$CO, and C$_2$H toward both protoplanetary disks. Based on the observed disk-integrated line fluxes and flux ratios, we do not find significant differences between isolated and irradiated disks. The observed differences seem to be more closely related to the different stellar masses than to the external radiation field. This suggests that these disks are far enough away from the massive Trapezium stars, that their chemistry is no longer affected by external FUV radiation. Additional observations towards lower-mass disks and disks closer to the massive Trapezium stars are required to elucidate the level of external radiation required to make an impact on the chemistry of planet formation in different kinds of disks.

 - **Abstract**
 A new degravitation mechanism within the framework of scalar tensor gravity is proposed. The mechanism eliminates all constant contributions from the potential to the Friedmann equation, leaving only the kinematic and the dynamic terms of the potential to drive cosmic acceleration. We explore a scenario involving a density-triggered phase transition in the late-time universe, and argue that the resulting effective energy density and equation of state parameter can explain late-time cosmology when extrapolated to a region of the parameter space.
