          Seeking the nearest neutron stars using a new local electron density map

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars provide a compelling testing ground for gravity, nuclear dynamics, and physics beyond the Standard Model, and so it will be useful to locate the neutron stars nearest to Earth. To that end, we revisit pulsar distance estimates extracted from the dispersion measure of pulsar radio waves scattering on electrons. In particular, we create a new electron density map for the local kiloparsec by fitting to parallax measurements of the nearest pulsars, which complements existing maps that are fit on the Galactic scale. This ``near-Earth'' electron density map implies that pulsars previously estimated to be 100-200 pc away may be as close as tens of parsecs away, which motivates a parallax-based measurement campaign to follow-up on these very-near candidate pulsars. Such nearby neutron stars would be valuable laboratories for testing fundamental physics phenomena, including several late-stage neutron star heating mechanisms, using current and forthcoming telescopes. We illustrate this by estimating the sensitivities of the upcoming Extremely Large Telescope and Thirty Meter Telescope to neutron stars heated by dark matter capture.

          SIRIUS: Identifying Metal-poor Stars Enriched by a Single Supernova in a Star-by-star Cosmological Zoom-in Simulation of a Dwarf Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 Metal-poor stars enriched by a single supernova (mono-enriched stars) are direct proof (and provide valuable probes) of supernova nucleosynthesis. Photometric and spectroscopic observations have shown that metal-poor stars have a wide variety of chemical compositions; the star's chemical composition reflects the nucleosynthesis process(es) that occurred before the star's formation. While the identification of mono-enriched stars enables us to study the ejecta properties of a single supernova, the fraction of mono-enriched stars among metal-poor stars remains unknown. Here we identify mono-enriched stars in a star-by-star cosmological zoom-in simulation of a dwarf galaxy. We find that the fraction of mono-enriched stars is higher for lower metallicity, stars with [Fe/H] $< -2.5$. The percentages of mono-enriched stars are 11% at [Fe/H] = $-$5.0 and 1% at [Fe/H] = $-$2.5, suggesting that most metal-poor stars are affected by multiple supernovae. We also find that mono-enriched stars tend to be located near the center of the simulated dwarf. Such regions will be explored in detail in upcoming surveys such as the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) on the Subaru telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 The differentiation between chaotic and stochastic systems has long been scrutinized, particularly in observations where data is often noise-contaminated and finite. Our research examines the dual nature of the black hole X-ray binary IGR J17091-3624, an object whose behavior has been closely studied in parallel to GRS 1915+105. Remarkable similarities in the temporal classes of these two objects are explored in literature. However, this was not the case with their non-linear dynamics: GRS 1915+105 shows signs of determinism, while IGR J17091-3624 was found to be stochastic. In this study, we confront the inherent challenge of noise contamination, as in IGR J17091-3624, faced by previous studies, particularly Poisson noise, which adversely impacts the reliability of non-linear results. We employ several denoising techniques to mitigate noise effects and employ methods like Autoencoder, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Correlation Integral (CI) to isolate the deterministic signatures. We have found signs of determinism in IGR J17091-3624 after denoising, thus supporting the hypothesis of it being similar to GRS 1915+105, even as a dynamical system.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomers have found more than a dozen planets transiting 10-40 million year old stars, but even younger transiting planets have remained elusive. A possible reason for the lack of such discoveries is that newly formed planets are not yet in a configuration that would be recognized as a transiting planet or cannot exhibit transits because our view is blocked by a protoplanetary disk. However, we now know that many outer disks are warped; provided the inner disk is depleted, transiting planets may thus be visible. Here we report the observations of the transiting planet IRAS 04125+2902 b orbiting a 3 Myr, 0.7 M$_\odot$, pre-main sequence star in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. IRAS 04125+2902 hosts a nearly face-on (i $\sim$ 30$^\circ$) transitional disk and a wide binary companion. The planet has a period of 8.83 days, a radius of 10.9 R$_\oplus$ (0.97R$_J$), and a 95%-confidence upper limit on its mass of 90M$_\oplus$ (0.3M$_J$) from radial velocity measurements, making it a possible precursor of the super-Earths and sub-Neptunes that are commonly found around main-sequence stars. The rotational broadening of the star and the orbit of the wide (4", 635 AU) companion are both consistent with edge-on orientations. Thus, all components of the system appear to be aligned except the outer disk; the origin of this misalignment is unclear. Given the rare set of circumstances required to detect a transiting planet at ages when the disk is still present, IRAS 04125+2902 b likely provides a unique window into sub-Neptunes immediately following formation.

          Convective mixing in distant and close-in giant planets -- Dependences on the initial composition, luminosity, bloating and semi-convection

 - **Abstract**
 Recent structure models of Jupiter suggest the existence of an extended region in the deep interior with a high heavy element abundance, referred to as a dilute core. This finding has led to increased interest in modelling the formation and evolution processes with the goal of understanding how and under what circumstances such a structure is formed and retained, to in turn better understand the relation between atmospheric and bulk metallicity. We modelled the evolution of giant planets, varying various parameters relevant for the convective mixing process, such as the mixing length parameter and the size of the mesh, and parameters related to the general evolution, such as the orbital distance and the initial luminosity. We in particular studied hot Jupiters and find that the effect of bloating on the mixing process is small but can in some cases inhibit convective mixing by lowering the intrinsic luminosity for a given entropy. Semi-convection can significantly lower the extent of a dilute core if it is strong enough. We find that dilute cores are unable to persist for initial luminosities much higher than 3 x 1e3 LJ for a Jupiter-like planet for the initial heavy element profiles we studied. From this we conclude that, based on our model, it is unlikely that a large number of giant planets retain a dilute core throughout their evolution, although this is dependent on the assumptions and limitations of our method. Future work should focus on improving the link between formation and evolution models so that the mixing process is accurately modelled throughout a planet's lifetime and on improving the understanding of how to model convection near radiative-convective boundaries.

 - **Abstract**
 In the past, researchers have mostly relied on single-resolution images from individual telescopes to detect gravitational lenses. We propose a search for galaxy-scale lenses that, for the first time, combines high-resolution single-band images (in our case the Hubble Space Telescope, HST) with lower-resolution multi-band images (in our case Legacy survey, LS) using machine learning. This methodology aims to simulate the operational strategies that will be employed by future missions, such as combining the images of Euclid and the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). To compensate for the scarcity of lensed galaxy images for network training, we have generated mock lenses by superimposing arc features onto HST images, saved the lens parameters, and replicated the lens system in the LS images. We test four architectures based on ResNet-18: (1) using single-band HST images, (2) using three bands of LS images, (3) stacking these images after interpolating the LS images to HST pixel scale for simultaneous processing, and (4) merging a ResNet branch of HST with a ResNet branch of LS before the fully connected layer. We compare these architecture performances by creating Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for each model and comparing their output scores. At a false-positive rate of $10^{-4}$, the true-positive rate is $\sim$0.41, $\sim$0.45, $\sim$0.51 and $\sim$0.55, for HST, LS, stacked images and merged branches, respectively. Our results demonstrate that models integrating images from both the HST and LS significantly enhance the detection of galaxy-scale lenses compared to models relying on data from a single instrument. These results show the potential benefits of using both Euclid and LSST images, as wide-field imaging surveys are expected to discover approximately 100,000 lenses.

 - **Abstract**
 This study uses the Pearson's chi-square test to analyze the VNIR reflectance spectra of seven asteroids and look for spectral matches among approximately 11,000 laboratory spectra of meteoritic, terrestrial, synthetic, Apollo, and Luna samples. First, we use the chi-square method to analyze three well-studied asteroids - (4) Vesta, (6) Hebe, and (19) Fortuna - to establish the technique's reliability by attempting to confirm previously predicted spectral matches. The chi-square test is then applied to four other asteroids: the Mars trojans (5261) Eureka, (101429) 1998 VF31, (311999) 2007 NS2, and (385250) 2001 DH47. This study focuses on Mars trojans because of their undetermined origin and possible relationship to Mars. For asteroids that may have undergone space weathering, reddening effects are removed from the spectra to allow for a more accurate chi-square analysis. The top chi-square matches among the Mars trojans reveal significant spectral similarities with Martian meteorites and minerals found on Mars, supporting the hypothesis of a Martian origin for the analyzed Mars trojans. However, the possibility that these Mars trojans could be fragments of a disrupted differentiated body or bodies cannot be ruled out. We find that using the chi-square test with a large number of laboratory spectra is a very useful initial technique for identifying spectral analogs to asteroids.

 We report on follow-up observations of the recently discovered transient by the Einstein Probe, EP240709A, with the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). We also incorporated archival multiwavelength survey data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (X-ray), Gaia (optical), the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (gamma-ray), and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (infrared) to distinguish between blazars and stellar systems. We suggest that EP240709A is likely an active blazar.

 Context. Spectroscopic surveys like APOGEE, GALAH, and LAMOST have significantly advanced our understanding of the Milky Way by providing extensive stellar parameters and chemical abundances. Complementing these, photometric surveys with narrow/medium-band filters, such as the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS), offer the potential to estimate stellar parameters and abundances for a much larger number of stars. Aims. This work develops methodologies to extract stellar atmospheric parameters and selected chemical abundances from S-PLUS photometric data, which spans ~3000 square degrees using seven narrowband and five broadband filters. Methods. Using 66 S-PLUS colors, we estimated parameters based on training samples from LAMOST, APOGEE, and GALAH, applying Cost-Sensitive Neural Networks (NN) and Random Forests (RF). We tested for spurious correlations by including abundances not covered by the S-PLUS filters and evaluated NN and RF performance, with NN consistently outperforming RF. Including Teff and log g as features improved accuracy by ~3%. We retained only parameters with a goodness-of-fit above 50%. Results. Our approach provides reliable estimates of fundamental parameters (Teff, log g, [Fe/H]) and abundance ratios such as [{\alpha}/Fe], [Al/Fe], [C/Fe], [Li/Fe], and [Mg/Fe] for ~5 million stars, with goodness-of-fit >60%. Additional ratios like [Cu/Fe], [O/Fe], and [Si/Fe] were derived but are less accurate. Validation using star clusters, TESS, and J-PLUS data confirmed the robustness of our methodology. Conclusions. By leveraging S-PLUS photometry and machine learning, we present a cost-effective alternative to high-resolution spectroscopy for deriving stellar parameters and abundances, enabling insights into Milky Way stellar populations and supporting future classification efforts.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the polarization calibration of the 19-beam receiver at 1420 MHz within the full illumination of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope from October 2018 to March 2023. We perform spider observations to characterize the on-axis Mueller matrix of the central beam. The calibrated polarization percentage and polarization angle of a source with strong linear polarization emission are about 0.2\% and 0.5$^{\circ}$. Several parameters of the central-beam Mueller matrix show time variability from months to years, suggesting relatively frequent polarization calibrations are needed. We obtain the Mueller matrix parameters of the 18 off-center beams with the combination of on-the-fly observations and spider observations. The polarization calibration provides consistent fractional Stokes parameters of the 19 beams, although the Mueller matrix parameters of the off-center beams are not as accurate as those of the central beam. The Mueller matrix parameters of the central beam do not show a strong dependence on the reflector surface. However, we notice different off-center Mueller matrix parameters between the eastern and western sides of the reflector surface. We provide average parameters of the 19-beam Mueller matrices which should be applicable to observations from 2020 to 2022 with several caveats. After applying the average parameters, on-axis fractional linear polarization measurements $\gtrsim$ 10\% and on-axis fractional circular polarization measurements $\gtrsim$ 1.5\% can be considered high-confidence detections. For sources with weak polarization, timely polarization calibrations using spider observations are required.

          KIC 4150611: A quadruply eclipsing heptuple star system with a g-mode period-spacing pattern Asteroseismic modelling of the g-mode period-spacing pattern

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we aim to estimate the stellar parameters of the primary (Aa) by performing asteroseismic analysis on its period-spacing pattern. We use the C-3PO neural network to perform asteroseismic modelling of the g-mode period-spacing pattern of Aa, discussing the interplay of this information with external constraints from spectroscopy ($T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log(g)$) and eclipse modelling ($R$). To estimate the level of uncertainty due to different frequency extraction and pattern identification processes, we consider four different variations on the period-spacing patterns. To better understand the correlations between and the uncertainty structure of our parameter estimates, we also employed a classical, parameter-based MCMC grid search on four different stellar grids. The best-fitting, externally constrained model to the period-spacing pattern arrives at estimates of the stellar properties for Aa of: $M=1.51 \pm 0.05 M_\odot$, $X_c =0.43 \pm 0.04$, $R=1.66 \pm 0.1 R_\odot$, $f_{\rm ov}=0.010$, $\Omega_c=1.58 \pm 0.01$ d$^{-1}$ with rigid rotation to within the measurement errors, $\log(T_{\rm eff})=3.856 \pm 0.008$ dex, $\log(g)=4.18 \pm 0.04$ dex, and $\log(L)=0.809 \pm 0.005$ dex, which agree well with previous measurements from eclipse modelling, spectroscopy, and the Gaia DR3 luminosity. We find that the near-core properties of the best-fitting asteroseismic models are consistent with external constraints from eclipse modelling and spectroscopy. Aa appears to be a typical example of a $\gamma$ Dor star, fitting well within existing populations. We find that Aa is quasi-rigidly rotating to within the uncertainties, and note that the asteroseismic age estimate for Aa (1100 $\pm$ 100 Myr) is considerably older than the young (35 Myr) age implied by previous isochrone fits to the B binary in the literature. Our MCMC parameter-based grid-search agrees well with our pattern-modelling approach.

          Fast dynamic ejecta in neutron star mergers

 - **Abstract**
 The ejection of neutron-rich matter is one of the most important consequences of a neutron star merger. While the bulk of the matter is ejected at fast, but non-relativistic velocities ($\sim0.2c$), a small amount of mildly relativistic dynamic ejecta have been seen in a number of numerical simulations. Such ejecta can have far reaching observational consequences ranging from the shock breakout burst of gamma-rays promptly after the merger, to an early ($\sim 1$ hour post-merger) blue kilonova precursor signal, to synchrotron emission years after the merger ("kilonova afterglow"). These all potentially carry the imprint of the binary system parameters and the equation of state. By analyzing Lagrangian simulations in full General Relativity, performed with the code SPHINCS\_BSSN, we identify two ejection mechanisms for fast ejecta: i) about 30\% of the ejecta with {$v> 0.4c$} are "sprayed out" from the shear interface between the merging stars and escape along the orbital plane and ii) the remaining $\sim$ 70\% of the fast ejecta result from the central object "bouncing back" after strong, general-relativistic compression. This "bounce component" is ejected in a rather isotropic way and reaches larger velocities (by $\sim0.1c$) so that its faster parts can catch up with and shock slower parts of the spray ejecta. Even for a case that promptly collapses to a black hole, we find fast ejecta with similar properties to the non-collapsing case, while slower matter parts are swallowed by the forming black hole. We discuss observational implications of these fast ejecta, including shock breakout and kilonova afterglow.

          A self-consistent quasilinear theory for collisionless relaxation to universal quasi-steady state attractors in cold dark matter halos

 - **Abstract**
 Collisionless self-gravitating systems, e.g., cold dark matter halos, harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation, the origin of which has been a persistent mystery. To solve this problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of driven, inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation (QLDE) for the secular evolution of the mean distribution function $f_0$ of a halo due to linear fluctuations (induced by random perturbations in the force field) that are collectively dressed by self-gravity, a phenomenon described by the response matrix. Unlike previous studies, we treat collective dressing up to all orders. Well-known halo density profiles $\rho(r)$ commonly observed in $N$-body simulations, including the $r^{-1}$ NFW cusp, an Einasto central core, and the $r^{-1.5}$ prompt cusp, emerge as quasi-steady state attractor solutions of the QLDE. The $r^{-1}$ cusp is a constant flux steady-state solution for a constantly accreting massive halo perturbed by small-scale white noise fluctuations induced by substructure. It is an outcome of the universal nature of collisionless relaxation: lower energy particles attract more particles, gain higher effective mass and get less accelerated by the fluctuating force field. The zero-flux steady state solution for an isolated halo is an $f_0$ that is flat in energy, and the corresponding $\rho(r)$ can either be cored or an $r^{-1.5}$ cusp depending on the inner boundary condition. The latter forms around a central dense object, e.g., a compact subhalo or a black hole. We demonstrate for the first time that these halo profiles emerge as quasi-steady state attractors of collisionless relaxation described by a self-consistent QLT.

          New pulsating stars detected in EA-type eclipsing binary systems based on TESS data

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsating stars in eclipsing binaries are very important to understand stellar interior structures through astroseismology because their absolute parameters such as the masses and radii can be determined in high precision based on photometric and spectroscopic data. The high-precision and continuously time-series photometric data of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to search for and study this kind of variable stars in the whole sky. About 1626 Algol type (EA-type) eclipsing binary systems were observed by TESS in the 1-45 sectors with 2-minutes short cadence. By analyzing those TESS data, we found 57 new pulsating stars in EA-type binary stars. The preliminary results show that those binary systems have orbital periods in the range from 0.4 to 27 days, while the periods of pulsating components are in the range from 0.02 to 5 days. It is detected that 43 targets follow the correlation between pulsation and orbital periods of oscillating eclipsing binaries of Algol type (oEA), which may indicate that they are typical oEA stars. The other 14 targets may be other types of variable stars in eclipsing binary systems. These objects are a very interesting source to investigate the binary structures and evolutions as well as to understand the influences of tidal forces and mass transfer on stellar pulsations.

          New constraints on the primordial curvature perturbations on small scales

 - **Abstract**
 The power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ has been measured with high precision on large scales $10^{-4}\lesssim k\lesssim 3~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, basing on the observations of cosmic microwave background, Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and large scale structure. On small scales $3\lesssim k \lesssim 10^{23}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, the constrains are mainly from the studies on the primordial black holes (PBHs). Specifically, on small scales $10^{17}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{23}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$, the limits arise from studies on the lightest supersymmetric particles produced by PBHs radiation and the stable Planck-mass relics after its evaporation. It has been demonstrated that the big bang nucleosynthesis can be used to constrain the initial fraction of PBHs with masses $10^{9}\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{13}~{\rm g}$, corresponding to the scales $10^{16}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{18}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$. Recently, on one hand, it is found that the evaporation of light PBHs ($M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{9}\rm g$) can modify the expansion rate of the Universe and the baryon-to-photon ratio, resulting in the influences on the primordial abundance of light nuclei. On the other hand, it has been proposed that the `memory burden' effect can slow down the mass loss rate of black hole (BH), leading to the existence of light PBHs by now. Based on the recent theoretical research process of BH and the limits on the (initial) mass fraction of light PBHs with masses $10^{4}\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{10}~\rm g$, we derive new constraints on $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ on small scales $1.5\times 10^{18}\lesssim k\lesssim 2.5\times 10^{21}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, which are rarely studied in previous literature.

          Potential for life to exist and be detected on Earth-like planets orbiting white dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 With recent observations confirming exoplanets orbiting white dwarfs, there is growing interest in exploring and quantifying the habitability of temperate rocky planets around white dwarfs. In this work, the limits of the habitable zone of an Earth-like planet around a white dwarf are computed based on the incident stellar flux, and these limits are utilized to assess the duration of habitability at a given orbital distance. For a typical $0.6 M_\odot$ white dwarf an Earth-like planet at $\sim 0.012$ AU could remain in the temporally evolving habitable zone, maintaining conditions to support life, for nearly 7 Gyr. In addition, additional constraints on habitability are studied for the first time by imposing the requirement of receiving sufficient photon fluxes for UV-mediated prebiotic chemistry and photosynthesis. We demonstrate that these thresholds are comfortably exceeded by planets in the habitable zone. The prospects for detecting atmospheric biosignatures are also evaluated, and shown to require integration times on the order of one hour or less for ongoing space observations with JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric mass loss is thought to have strongly shaped the sample of close-in exoplanets. These atmospheres should be lost isotropically, leading to no net migration on the planetary orbit. However, strong stellar winds can funnel the escaping atmosphere into a tail trailing the planet. We derive a simple kinematic model of the gravitational interaction between the planet and this anisotropic wind, and derive expressions for the expected migration of the planet. Over the expected range of parameters, we find typical migrations of a few tenths to a few percent inward. We argue that this modest migration may be observable for planet pairs near mean motion resonances, which would provide an independent observational constraint on atmospheric mass loss models.

 - **Abstract**
 The solar wind is typically categorized as fast and slow based on the measured speed ($v_\mathrm{sw}$). The separation between these two regimes is often set between 400 and 600 km/s without a rigorous definition. Observations of the solar wind's kinetic signatures, chemical makeup, charge state properties, and Alfvénicity suggest that such a two-state model may be insufficiently nuanced to capture the relationship between the solar wind and its solar sources. We test this two-state fast/slow solar wind paradigm with heavy ion abundances (X/H) and characterize how the transition between fast and slow wind states impacts heavy ion in the solar wind. We show that (1) the speed at which heavy ion abundances indicate a change between fast and slow solar wind as a function of speed is slower than the speed indicated by the helium abundance; (2) this speed is independent of heavy ion mass and charge state; (3) the abundance at which heavy ions indicate the transition between fast and slow wind is consistent with prior observations of fast wind abundances; (4) and there may be a mass or charge-state dependent fractionation process present in fast wind heavy ion abundances. We infer that (1) identifying slow solar wind as having a speed $v_\mathrm{sw} \lesssim$ 400 km/s may mix solar wind from polar and equatorial sources; (2) He may be impacted by the acceleration necessary for the solar wind to reach the asymptotic fast, non-transient values observed at 1 AU; and (3) heavy ions are fractionated in the fast wind by a yet-to-be-determined mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 The radiation reprocessing model, in which an optically-thick outflow absorbs the high-energy emission from a central source and re-emits in longer wavelengths, has been frequently invoked to explain some optically bright transients, such as fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) whose progenitor and explosion mechanism are still unknown. Previous studies on this model did not take into account the frequency dependence of the opacity. We study the radiative reprocessing and calculate the UV-optical-NIR band spectra from a spherical outflow composed of pure hydrogen gas, for a time-dependent outflowing mass rate. Electron scattering and frequency-dependent bound-free, free-free opacities are considered. The spectrum deviates from the blackbody at NIR and UV frequencies; in particular, it has $\nu L_{\nu} \propto \nu^{1.5}$ at NIR frequencies, because at these frequencies the absorption optical depth from the outflow's outer edge to the so-called photon trapping radius is large and is frequency dependent. We apply our model to the proto-type FBOT AT2018cow by {the spectra} to the observed SED. The best-fit mass loss rate suggests that the total outflow mass in AT2018cow is $M_{\rm out} \approx 5.7^{+0.4}_{-0.4} \, M_{\odot}$. If that equals the total mass lost during an explosion, and if the progenitor is a blue supergiant (with a pre-explosion mass of $\sim 20 \, M_{\odot}$), then it will suggest that the central compact remnant mass is at least $\approx \, \rm{14 \, M_{\odot}}$. This would imply that the central remnant is a black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gamma-Ray Transient Monitor (GTM) is an all-sky monitor onboard the Distant Retrograde Orbit-A (DRO-A) satellite, with the scientific objective of detecting gamma-ray bursts in the energy range of 20 keV to 1 MeV. The GTM is equipped with five Gamma-Ray Transient Probes (GTPs), utilizing silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays coupled with NaI(Tl) scintillators for signal readout. To test the performance of the GTP in detecting electrons, we independently developed a continuous-energy-tunable, low-current, quasi-single-electron accelerator, and used this facility for ground-based electron calibration of the GTP. This paper provides a detailed description of the operational principles of the unique electron accelerator and comprehensively presents the process and results of electron calibration for the GTP. The calibration results indicate that the dead time for normal signals is less than 4 $\mu$s, while for overflow signals, it is approximately 70 $\mu$s, consistent with the design specifications. The GTP's time-recording capability is working correctly, accurately recording overflow events. The GTP responds normally to electrons in the 0.4-1.4 MeV energy range. The ground-based electron calibration validates the design of the GTP and enhances the probe's mass model, laying the foundation for payload development, in-orbit observation strategies, and scientific data analysis.

          Measuring the Intensity of the Interstellar Radiation Field with Ultra-high Energy $\gamma$ ray Spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Our understanding of the intensity distribution of the interstellar radiation background is based on the observational data from IRAS, COBE-FIRAS and Planck. The intensity of this radiation field increases rapidly towards the Galactic plane and is the highest near the Galactic centre due to the high density of stars and dust. However, a precise determination of the variations of this radiation field with spatial and angular coordinates is not feasible observationally. We explore how future studies of gamma-ray spectra from numerous ultra-high-energy gamma-ray sources can indirectly probe variations in the interstellar radiation field's intensity across different distances from the Galactic centre and across Galactic latitudes and longitudes. This study is crucial for making self-consistent predictions of high energy gamma-ray fluxes from Galactic sources detected by observatories like LHAASO, Tibet AS$_{\gamma}$ and the next-generation gamma-ray telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 The basic framework of the superfluid vortex model for pulsar glitches, though, is well accepted; there is a lack of consensus on the possible trigger mechanism responsible for the simultaneous release of a large number ($\sim 10^{17}$) of superfluid vortices from the inner crust. Here, we propose a simple trigger mechanism to explain such catastrophic events of vortex unpinning. We treat a superfluid vortex line as a classical massive straight string with well-defined string tension stretching along the rotation axis of pulsars. The crustquake-induced lattice vibration of the inner crust can act as a driving force for the transverse oscillation of the string. Such forced oscillation near resonance causes the bending of the vortex lines, disturbing their equilibrium configuration and resulting in the unpinning of vortices. We consider unpinning from the inner crust's so-called {\it strong (nuclear)} pinning region, where the vortices are likely pinned to the nuclear sites. We also comment on vortex unpinning from the interstitial pinning region of the inner crust. We sense that unifying crustquake with the superfluid vortex model can naturally explain the cause of large-scale vortex unpinning and generation of large-size pulsar glitches.

 - **Abstract**
 The heating of the solar corona and solar wind, through suprathermal particles and kinetic Alfvén waves within the 0 - 10 $R_{\rm Sun}$ range, has been a subject of great interest for many decades. This study investigates the acceleration and heating of charged particles and the role of KAWs in the solar corona. We investigate how KAWs transport energy and accelerate/heat the charged particles, focusing on the behavior of perturbed EM fields, Poynting flux vectors, net power transfer, resonant particle speed, group speed, and the damping length of KAWs. The study examines how these elements are influenced by suprathermal particles \kappa and the electron-to-ion temperature $T_e/T_i$. We use kinetic plasma theory coupled with the Vlasov-Maxwell model to investigate the dynamics of KAWs and particles. We assume a collisionless, homogeneous, and low-beta electron-ion plasma in which Alfvén waves travel in the kinetic limits. The results show the perturbed EM fields are significantly influenced by $\kappa$ and $T_e/T_i$. We evaluate both the parallel and perpendicular Poynting fluxes and find that the parallel Poynting flux dissipates gradually for lower \kappa values. The perpendicular flux dissipates quickly over shorter distances. Power deposition in solar flux tubes is significantly influenced by \kappa and Te/Ti. We find that particles can heat the solar corona over long distances in the parallel direction and short distances in the perpendicular direction. The group velocity of KAWs increases for lower \kappa values, and the damping length is enhanced under lower \kappa, suggesting longer energy transport distances. These findings offer a comprehensive understanding of particle-wave interactions in the solar corona and wind, with potential applications for missions such as the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), and can also apply to other environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Binary star systems allow us to study the planet formation process under extreme conditions. In the early stages, these systems contain a circumbinary disk and a disk around each star. To model the interactions between these disks in the frame of one of the stars, strong fictitious forces must be included in the simulations. The original Fargo and the Fargo3D codes fail to correctly simulate such systems if the indirect term becomes too strong. Aims. We present a different way to compute the indirect term which, together with a tensor artificial viscosity prescription, allows the Fargo code to simulate the circumbinary disks in a non-inertial frame of reference. In this way, the Fargo code can be used to study interactions between circumstellar and circumbinary disks. Results. We find that updating the indirect term becomes relevant when the indirect term becomes stronger than the direct gravitational forces, which occurs for mass ratios of $q > 5\%$. The default artificial viscosity used in the Fargo code inherently produces artificial pressure in a non-inertial frame of reference even in the absence of shocks. This leads to artificial mass ejection from the Hill sphere, starting at brown dwarf masses ($q > 1\%$). These problems can be mitigated by using a tensor artificial viscosity formulation. For high mass ratios, $q > 1\%$, it is also becomes important to initialize the disk in the center-of-mass frame. We expect our proposed changes to be relevant for other grid-based hydrodynamic codes where strong indirect terms occur, or for codes that use artificial viscosity.

 - **Abstract**
 The Hercules kinematic group is a kinematic anomaly of stars observed in the solar neighbourhood (SNd). In this series of papers, we present a comprehensive study of this structure. This paper focuses on its chemical signatures over several groups of elements. The next paper discusses its kinematical properties. While studies suggested a non-native origin of Hercules stars due to the distinct chemical and kinematic features, previous studies focussed mainly on the Fe abundances. We adopt chemical data with abundances of elements from APOGEE and GALAH to seek further chemical evidence of the origin. Our analysis reveals that the low alpha population of the low angular momentum Hercules group is significantly enhanced in iron-peak (Fe, Ni, Mn) and odd-Z (Na, Al) elements, and slightly deficient in alpha elements (O, Ca, Ti) compared to kinematically local stars. The super enhancement in iron-peak elements and deficiency in alpha elements support their origin from the outer thin bar in the inner Galaxy. Moreover, the enhancement in Na and Al indicates these stars as the youngest stars in the old sequence from the inner thick disc. Hence, the origin of these stars can be related to the outer bar region. These chemical signatures require the underlying dynamical mechanism that forms the Hercules group to be capable of transporting stars in the inner Galaxy out to the SNd. The next paper will consider the Trojan orbits as the favoured mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 The Hercules structure is a stellar kinematic group anomaly observed in the solar neighbourhood (SNd). In the previous paper, we analysed chemical signatures and related the origin of this stellar population to the outer bar. Next to consider is how this alien population migrate out into the SNd. Often, the formation of this kinematic structure is associated with bar resonances. In this paper, We consider the driving mechanism of Hercules on the orbital level. We construct a simple Milky Way-like potential model with a slowly rotating long bar and explore some of the stellar orbit families and their stability. With this model, our numerical solutions of the equations of motion show that extended quasi-periodic orbits trapped around fast-rotating periodic orbits around the L4 Lagrange point of the bar minor axis can pass through the SNd. When observed in the SNd, they populate the Hercules structure in the Lz-Vr kinematics space. Moreover, the variation in radial coverage in the galactic plane with the SNd kinematics shows good agreement with chemical signatures found in Paper I. Furthermore, the effective potential shows the topology of a volcano, the rim of which limits most orbits to stay inside or outside. Trojan orbits are a stable orbit family that can transport inner Galactic stars out to the SNd. They can explain the stellar kinematics of the Hercules group, and provide a straightforward basis for its chemical properties (see Paper I). We support the view that Trojan orbits associated with the slowly rotating Galactic bar explain the Hercules structure observed in SNd.

 - **Abstract**
 Interactions between magma oceans and overlying atmospheres on young rocky planets leads to an evolving feedback of outgassing, greenhouse forcing, and mantle melt fraction. Previous studies have predominantly focused on the solidification of oxidized Earth-similar planets, but the diversity in mean density and irradiation observed in the low-mass exoplanet census motivate exploration of strongly varying geochemical scenarios. We aim to explore how variable redox properties alter the duration of magma ocean solidification, the equilibrium thermodynamic state, melt fraction of the mantle, and atmospheric composition. We develop a 1D coupled interior-atmosphere model that can simulate the time-evolution of lava planets. This is applied across a grid of fixed redox states, orbital separations, hydrogen endowments, and C/H ratios around a Sun-like star. The composition of these atmospheres is highly variable before and during solidification. The evolutionary path of an Earth-like planet at 1 AU ranges between permanent magma ocean states and solidification within 1 Myr. Recently solidified planets typically host H2O- or H2-dominated atmospheres in the absence of escape. Orbital separation is the primary factor determining magma ocean evolution, followed by the total hydrogen endowment, mantle oxygen fugacity, and finally the planet's C/H ratio. Collisional absorption by H2 induces a greenhouse effect which can prevent or stall magma ocean solidification. Through this effect, as well as the outgassing of other volatiles, geochemical properties exert significant control over the fate of magma oceans on rocky planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Deconvolution of astronomical images is a key aspect of recovering the intrinsic properties of celestial objects, especially when considering ground-based observations. This paper explores the use of diffusion models (DMs) and the Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) algorithm to solve this inverse problem task. We apply score-based DMs trained on high-resolution cosmological simulations, through a Bayesian setting to compute a posterior distribution given the observations available. By considering the redshift and the pixel scale as parameters of our inverse problem, the tool can be easily adapted to any dataset. We test our model on Hyper Supreme Camera (HSC) data and show that we reach resolutions comparable to those obtained by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. Most importantly, we quantify the uncertainty of reconstructions and propose a metric to identify prior-driven features in the reconstructed images, which is key in view of applying these methods for scientific purposes.

 - **Abstract**
 Deuterium was primarily created during the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). This fact, alongside its fractionation reactions resulting in enhanced abundances of deuterated molecules, means that these abundances can be used to better understand many processes within the interstellar medium (ISM), as well as its history. Previously, observations of deuterated molecules have been limited to the Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds and (with respect to HD) to quasar absorption spectra. We present the first robust detection of a deuterated molecule in a starburst environment and, besides HD, the first one detected outside the Local Group. We therefore can constrain the deuterium fractionation, as observed by DCN. We observed the CMZ of the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253 covering multiple Giant Molecular Clouds (GMC) with cloud scale observations ($\sim 30$ pc) using ALMA. Via the use of the \texttt{MADCUBA} package we were able to perform LTE analysis in order to obtain deuterium fractionation estimates. We detect DCN in the nuclear region of the starburst galaxy NGC 253 and estimate the deuterium fractionation (D/H ratio) of DCN within the GMCs of the CMZ of NGC 253. We find a range of $5 \times 10^{-4}$ to $10 \times 10^{-4}$, relatively similar to the values observed in warm Galactic star-forming regions. We also determine an upper limit of D/H of $8 \times 10^{-5}$ from DCO\plus within one region, closer to the cosmic value of D/H. Our observations of deuterated molecules within NGC 253 appear to be consistent with previous galactic studies of star forming regions. This implies that warmer gas temperatures increase the abundance of DCN relative to other deuterated species. This study also further expands the regions, particularly in the extragalactic domain, in which deuterated species have been detected.

 - **Abstract**
 The abundances resulting from $r$-process nucleosynthesis as predicted by simulations of binary neutron-star (BNS) mergers remain an open question as the current state-of-the-art is still restricted to three-species neutrino transport. We present the first BNS merger simulations employing a moment-based general-relativistic neutrino transport with five neutrino species, thus including (anti)muons and advanced muonic $\beta$-processes, and contrast them with traditional three neutrino-species simulations. Our results show that a muonic trapped-neutrino equilibrium is established, forming a different trapped-neutrino hierarchy akin to the electronic equilibrium. The formation of (anti)muons and the muonization via muonic $\beta$-processes enhance the neutrino luminosity, leading to rapid cooling in the early post-merger phase. Since muonic processes redirect part of the energy otherwise used for protonization by electronic processes, they yield a cooler remnant and disk, together with neutrino-driven winds that are more neutron-rich. Importantly, the unbound ejected mass is smaller than three-species simulations and, because of its comparatively smaller temperature and proton fraction, it can enhance lanthanide production and reduce the overproduction of light $r$-process elements for softer equations of state. This finding underlines the importance of muonic interactions and five neutrino species in long-lived BNS remnants.

 - **Abstract**
 The assumption of a flat universe that follows the cosmological principle, i.e., that the universe is statistically homogeneous and isotropic at large scales, comprises one of the core foundations of the standard cosmological model -- namely, the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Nevertheless, it has been seldom tested in the literature. In this work, we assess the validity of this hypothesis by reconstructing the cosmic curvature with currently available observations, such as Type Ia Supernova and Cosmic Chronometers. We do so by means of null tests, given by consistency relations within the standard model scenario, using a non-parametric method -- which allows us to circumvent prior assumptions on the underlying cosmology. We find no statistically significant departure from the cosmological principle and null curvature in our analysis. In addition, we show that future cosmological observations, such as those expected from Hubble parameter measurements from redshift surveys, along with gravitational wave observations as standard sirens, will be able to significantly reduce the uncertainties of current reconstructions.

 - **Abstract**
 Blue-tilted Gravitational Waves (BGWs) have been proposed as a potential candidate for the cosmic gravitational waves detected by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA). In the standard cosmological framework, BGWs are constrained in their frequency range by the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) limit on GW amplitude, which precludes their detection at interferometer scales. However, introducing a phase of early matter domination dilutes BGWs at higher frequencies, ensuring compatibility with both the BBN and LIGO constraints on stochastic GWs. This mechanism allows BGWs to align with PTA data while producing a distinct and testable GW signal across a broad frequency spectrum. Ultralight Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) could provide the required early matter-dominated phase to support this process. Interpreted through the lens of BGWs, the PTA results offer a way to constrain the parameter space of a new scenario involving modified Hawking radiation, known as the ``memory burden" effect, associated with ultralight PBHs. This interpretation can be further probed by high-frequency GW detectors. Specifically, we demonstrate that PBHs as light as $10^{2-3}~{\rm g}$ can leave detectable imprints on BGWs at higher frequencies while remaining consistent with PTA observations.

 A key to understand exoplanets is characterisation of their host stars. One of the most powerful tools to characterise stellar properties like effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity, is spectroscopy based on observations of stellar atmospheres. This chapter describes the stellar parameters that can be derived from a spectrum with examples of well established methods and theoretical model atmospheres. Combined with photometry and parallax measurements, the outcome of the spectroscopic modelling can be used to derive stellar radii and masses.

 - **Abstract**
 Red Supergiants (RSGs) are cool, evolved massive stars in the last evolutionary stage before exploding as a supernova. However, the most luminous RSGs may evolve blueward before exploding, given the observational evidence for luminous, warm, post-RSG objects and the lack of supernova progenitors originating from luminous RSGs. In this work, we analyze WOH G64, considered since the 1980s as the most extreme RSG in the Large Magellanic Cloud in terms of its size, luminosity, and mass-loss rate. Time-series photometry over the last 30 years reveals a sudden, yet smooth change from semi-regular to irregular variability in 2014. Multi-epoch optical spectroscopy confirms the transition, as WOH G64 now exhibits properties of a B[e] star in the optical, and warm-star features in the near-infrared. We report that WOH G64 has transitioned from a RSG to a Yellow Hypergiant and, moreover, has a B-star companion. The dramatic transition can be explained by: a) binary interactions partially stripping the envelope, b) the return of WOH G64 to a quiescent state after an outstanding eruption exceeding 30 years, and c) the expulsion of its outer layers due to a pre-SN superwind phase, indicating its imminent explosion. WOH G64 offers a unique opportunity to witness stellar evolution in real-time, providing crucial clues for the late phases of massive stars and their resulting supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar mass distribution in star-forming regions, stellar clusters and associations, the Initial Mass Function (IMF), appears to be invariant across different star-forming environments, and is consistent with the IMF observed in the Galactic field. Deviations from the field, or standard, IMF, if genuine, would be considered strong evidence for a different set of physics at play during the formation of stars in the birth region in question. We analyse N-body simulations of the evolution of spatially and kinematically substructured star-forming regions to identify the formation of binary star clusters, where two (sub)clusters which form from the same Giant Molecular Cloud orbit a common centre of mass. We then compare the mass distributions of stars in each of the subclusters and compare them to the standard IMF, which we use to draw the stellar masses in the star-forming region from which the binary cluster(s) form. In each binary cluster that forms, the mass distributions of stars in one subcluster deviates from the standard IMF, and drastically so when we apply similar mass resolution limits as for the observed binary clusters. Therefore, if a binary subcluster is observed to have an unusual IMF, this may simply be the result of dynamical evolution, rather than different physical conditions for star formation in these systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a status report of our intensive and long-term UBV RI photometric monitoring of nova KT Eri since its outbust in 2009. The old-nova in quiescence is characterized by very high excitation conditions (HeII 4686 being constantly the strongest emission line in optical spectra) and a complex-pattern photometric variability of one mag amplitude in which multi-periodicities (from hours to years) are mixed with chaotic activity of similar amplitude. Mean color and brightness levels are the same for pre- and post- outburst quiescence.

 - **Abstract**
 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) provides a powerful tool to measure cosmic expansion and consequently the nature of the Dark Energy (DE). Recent precise BAO measurements by Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument data release 1 (DESI DR1), when combined with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck and Supernovae of Type Ia (SN Ia), favor evolving dark energy over cosmological constant. This result is strongly related to the assumed priors on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization of DE. We test another parametrization which introduces two free parameters $n$ and $\alpha$, only $n$ is independent. Thus, it reduces the parameter space compared to the CPL model, which derives a more robust preference for evolving DE, if any. The model potentially produces three cosmological scenarios according to the values of its parameters. For $n=3$, the $\Lambda$CDM model is recovered, quintessence for $n<3$, and phantom for $n>3$. In the present study, we test the model on the background level, and, to our knowledge for the first time, on the linear perturbation level. Bayesian evidence analysis shows a weak preference for dynamical DE in the phantom regime over the cosmological constant DE using Planck, DESI, and PantheonPlus\&SH0ES data. The model predicts current phantom DE $w_{de,0} = -1.073 \pm 0.032$ and $H_0=70.9\pm 1.4$ km/s/Mpc when Planck+DESI data is used, which decreases the tension with $H_0$ local measurements to $1.2\sigma$ level.

 The exceptionally low mass of $0.77_{-0.17}^{+0.2} M_{\odot}$ for the central compact object (CCO) XMMU J173203.3 -- 344518 (XMMU J1732) in the supernova remnant (SNR) HESS J1731 -- 347 challenges standard neutron star (NS) formation models. The nearby post-AGB star IRAS 17287 -- 3443 ($\approx 0.6 M_\odot$), also within the SNR, enriches the scenario. To address this puzzle, we advance the possibility that the gravitational collapse of a rotating pre-SN iron core ($\approx 1.2 M_\odot$) could result in a low-mass NS. We show that angular momentum conservation during the collapse of an iron core rotating at $\approx 45\%$ of the Keplerian limit results in a mass loss of $\approx 0.3 M_\odot$, producing a stable newborn NS of $\approx 0.9 M_\odot$. Considering the possible spin-down, this indicates that the NS is now slowly rotating, thus fulfilling the observed mass-radius relation. Additionally, the NS's surface temperature ($\approx 2 \times 10^6$ K) aligns with canonical thermal evolution for its $\approx 4.5$ kyr age. We propose the pre -- SN star, likely an ultra-stripped core of $\approx 4.2 M_\odot$, formed a tidally locked binary with IRAS 17287 -- 3443, having a 1.43-day orbital period. The supernova led to a $\approx 3 M_\odot$ mass loss, imparting a kick velocity $\lesssim 670$ km s$^{-1}$, which disrupted the binary. This scenario explains the observed 0.3 pc offset between XMMU J1732 and IRAS 17287 -- 3443 and supports the possibility of CCOs forming in binaries, with rotation playing a key role in core-collapse, and the CCO XMMU J1732 being the lightest NS ever observed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery and analysis of a nearby eclipsing ultra-compact accreting binary at coordinates 11:38:10.91 $-$51:39:49.15 (SMSS J1138$-$5139), the first well-constrained LISA-detectable Type Ia supernova progenitor. Our time series optical spectroscopy identifies its orbital period through radial velocity monitoring at $P_{\rm orb,RV}=27.69\pm0.03~{\rm min}$; twice the photometric period seen in 2-minute cadence data from TESS Sector 37. We model our optical spectroscopy together with new simultaneous multi-band time series photometry from Gemini to place constraints on the binary parameters. Our light curve modeling finds that SMSS J1138$-$5139 contains an $M_2=0.24~{\rm M_\odot}$ pre-white dwarf donor with a massive $M_1=0.99~{\rm M_\odot}$ white dwarf accretor at orbital inclination $i=88.7~{\rm deg}$. Based on our photometrically derived system parameters, we expect that gravitational wave radiation will drive SMSS J1138$-$5139 to a merger within $\tau=5.7\pm0.3~{\rm Myr}$ and result in a Type Ia supernova. Even without a direct merger event, the component masses of SMSS J1138$-$5139 and active hydrogen accretion suggest that eventual helium accretion will likely also trigger a Type Ia supernova explosion through the dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation (D6) channel. We expect LISA to detect the gravitational wave emission from SMSS J1138$-$5139 with signal-to-noise $7-10$ after a 48-month mission.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a global census of metals in the Universe and their evolution with cosmic time, synthesizing robust estimates of metals in stars, hot intra-cluster gas, and gaseous absorbers tracing neutral gas as well as ionized gas in the circumgalactic and intergalactic media. We observe a 13-fold increase in the stellar metal mass density from z~2.5 to 0.7, over which time stars emerge as the most important metal reservoir at low redshifts, housing ~31% of the total expected metal density at z~0.1. Hot virialized intracluster/intragroup gas accounts for ~15% and 10% of metals at z~0.1 and 0.7, respectively. Using metallicity measurements from CCC, KODIAQ-Z, and HD-LLS surveys covering redshifts z<1 to z~2-3.5 we investigate the global distribution of metals in extragalactic ionized gas as a function of HI column density. During the period from z~3 to z<1, the global metal density of cool (T~10^{4-5} K) gas has doubled. However, the fractional contribution of the ionized gas to the total expected metal density decreased from ~20% at z~3 to ~4% at z<1. The cosmic metal density of all gas phases has increased with cosmic time, reflecting an "inside-out" metal dispersion by feedback mechanisms and galactic outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 The production of silicon monoxide (SiO) can be considered as a fingerprint of shock interaction. In this work, we use high-sensitivity observations of the SiO (2-1) and H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ (1-0) emission to investigate the broad and narrow SiO emission toward 146 massive star-forming regions in the ATOMS survey. We detected SiO emission in 136 regions and distinguished broad and narrow components across the extension of 118 sources (including 58 UC $H_{II}$ regions) with an average angular resolution of 2.5$^{\prime}$$^{\prime}$. The derived SiO luminosity ($L_{SiO}$) across the whole sample shows that the majority of $L_{SiO}$ (above 66$\%$) can be attributed to broad SiO, indicating its association with strong outflows. The comparison of the ALMA SiO images with the filamentary skeletons identified from H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ and in the infrared data (at 4.5, 8, and 24 $mu$m), further confirms that most SiO emission originates from outflows. However, note that for nine sources in our sample, the observed SiO emission may be generated by expanding UC $H_{II}$ regions. There is a moderate positive correlation between the bolometric luminosity ($L_{bol}$) and $L_{SiO}$ for both components (narrow and broad). The UC $H_{II}$ sources show a weaker positive correlation between $L_{bol}$ and $L_{SiO}$ and higher $L_{SiO}$ compared to the sources without UC $H_{II}$ regions. These results imply that the SiO emission from UC $H_{II}$ sources might be affected by UV-photochemistry induced by UC $H_{II}$ regions.

 - **Abstract**
 High precision differential Astrometry is the branch of astronomy that evaluates the relative position, distance and motion of celestial objects with respect to the stars present in the field of view. A mission called Theia has been submitted in 2022 for ESA's M7 call for missions, using a diffraction-limited telescope about 1m in diameter and with a field of view of 0.5 degrees, capable of achieving sub-micro-arcsecond angular accuracy, corresponding to 1e-5 pixel on the detector. Such precision makes it possible to study the nature of dark matter in our galaxy and to reveal the architecture of exoplanetary systems close to the Sun, down to the mass of the Earth. The aim of the experimental tests presented in this poster is to improve the TRL of 2 specific aspects: the calibration of new CMOS detectors with very large number of pixels and the calibration of the telescope this http URL, a key element of such a space telescope is the focal plane, which must be calibrated spatially with an extreme precision down to the 1e-5 pixel level. Previous work has shown that this is possible with small detector matrices (80x80 px) [1]. The goal is now to check the performances and validate this method with the new very large detectors. Pyxalis, a company based near Grenoble, is developing very large detectors (8000x5000 px) that have a low noise level and high sensitivity. The aim is to characterize and validate this type of detectors in a laboratory demonstration (see poster Pancher et al.), to ensure that the performance achieved meets the required specifications. We present the results of these characterization in this this http URL telescope stability is also a sensitive issue. Recent work [2] has shown that the reference stars in the field of the telescope can be used as actual metrology sources in order to compute the field distortion function. Our simulations allow to model the optical aberrations with bivariate polynoms. The effects on the calibration accuracy of the degrees of the polynoms, the number of reference stars and the tilt perturbation of the M2 mirror are investigated. This poster will present the latest results obtained on a test bed developed to experimentally study the performances of this new field calibration method.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanet detection surveys revealed the existence of numerous multi-planetary systems packed close to their stability limit. In this proceeding, we review the mechanism driving the instability of compact systems, originally published in Petit et al. (2020). Compact systems dynamics are dominated by the interactions between resonances involving triplets of planets. The complex network of three-planet mean motion resonances drives a slow chaotic semi-major axes diffusion, leading to a fast and destructive scattering phase. This model reproduces quantitatively the instability timescale found numerically. We can observe signpost of this process on exoplanet systems architecture. The critical spacing ensuring stability scales as the planet-to star mass ratio to the power 1/4. It explains why the Hill radius is not an adapted measure of dynamical compactness of exoplanet systems, particularly for terrestrial planets. We also provide some insight on the theoretical tools developed in the original work and how they can be of interest in other problems.

 - **Abstract**
 This work focuses on the ice features toward the binary protostellar system Ced 110 IRS 4A and 4B, and observed with JWST as part of the Early Release Science Ice Age collaboration. We aim to explore the JWST observations of the binary protostellar system Ced~110~IRS4A and IRS4B to unveil and quantify the ice inventories toward these sources. We compare the ice abundances with those found for the same molecular cloud. The analysis is performed by fitting or comparing laboratory infrared spectra of ices to the observations. Spectral fits are carried out with the ENIIGMA fitting tool that searches for the best fit. For Ced~110~IRS4B, we detected the major ice species H$_2$O, CO, CO$_2$ and NH$_3$. All species are found in a mixture except for CO and CO$_2$, which have both mixed and pure ice components. In the case of Ced~110~IRS4A, we detected the same major species as in Ced~110~IRS4B, as well as the following minor species CH$_4$, SO$_2$, CH$_3$OH, OCN$^-$, NH$_4^+$ and HCOOH. Tentative detection of N$_2$O ice (7.75~$\mu$m), forsterite dust (11.2~$\mu$m) and CH$_3^+$ gas emission (7.18~$\mu$m) in the primary source are also presented. Compared with the two lines of sight toward background stars in the Chameleon I molecular cloud, the protostar has similar ice abundances, except in the case of the ions that are higher in IRS4A. The clearest differences are the absence of the 7.2 and 7.4~$\mu$m absorption features due to HCOO$^-$ and icy complex organic molecules in IRS4A and evidence of thermal processing in both IRS4A and IRS4B as probed by the CO$_2$ ice features. We conclude that the binary protostellar system Ced~110~IRS4A and IRS4B has a large inventory of icy species. The similar ice abundances in comparison to the starless regions in the same molecular cloud suggest that the chemical conditions of the protostar were set at earlier stages in the molecular cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 The extreme temperature gradients from day- to nightside in the atmospheres of hot Jupiters generate fast winds in the form of equatorial jets or day-to-night flows. Observations of blue-shifted and red-shifted signals in the transmission and dayside spectra of WASP-189b have sparked discussions about the nature of winds on this planet. To investigate the structure of winds in the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-189b, we studied its dayside emission spectrum with CRIRES$^+$ in the spectral K band. We used the cross-correlation method to detect emission signals of CO and Fe, and employed a Bayesian framework to retrieve the atmospheric parameters relating to the temperature-pressure structure and chemistry. The retrieval incorporated a numerical model of the line profile influenced by various dynamic effects to determine the wind structure. The cross-correlation signals of CO and Fe showed a velocity offset of ~6km/s, which could be caused by a fast day-to-night wind in the atmosphere of WASP-189b. The atmospheric retrieval showed that the line profile of the observed spectra is best fitted by the presence of a day-to-night wind of 4.4km/s, while the retrieved equatorial jet velocity of 1.0km/s is consistent with the absence of such a jet. Such a wind pattern is consistent with the observed line broadening and can explain the majority of the velocity offset, while uncertainties in the ephemerides and the effects of a hot spot could also contribute to this offset. We further retrieved an inverted temperature-pressure profile and determined the C/O ratio and metallicity. We showed that red-shifts of a few km/s in the dayside spectra could be explained by day-to-night winds. Further studies combining transmission and dayside observations could advance our understanding of WASP-189b's atmospheric circulation by improving the uncertainties in the velocity offset and wind parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a long-term strong correlation between millimeter (mm) radio and $\gamma$-ray emission in the flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) PKS 1424-418. The mm$-\gamma$-ray connection in blazars is generally thought to originate from the relativistic jet close to the central engine. We confirm a unique long-lasting mm$-\gamma$-ray correlation of PKS 1424-418 by using detailed correlation analyses and statistical tests, and we find its physical meaning in the source. We employed ~8.5 yr of (sub)mm and $\gamma$-ray light curves observed by ALMA and Fermi-LAT, respectively. From linear and cross-correlation analyses between the light curves, we found a significant, strong mm$-\gamma$-ray correlation over the whole period. We did not find any notable time delay within the uncertainties for the mm$-\gamma$-ray correlation, which means zero lag. The mm wave spectral index values (S$_{\nu}$ $\propto$ $\nu_{\alpha}$) between the band 3 and 7 flux densities indicate a time-variable opacity of the source at (sub)mm wavelengths. Interestingly, the mm wave spectral index becomes temporarily flatter (i.e., $\alpha$ > $-$0.5) when the source flares in the $\gamma$-rays. We relate our results with the jet of PKS 1424-418, and we discuss the origin of the $\gamma$-rays and opacity of the inner (sub)parsec-scale jet regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is due to commence the 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the end of 2025. To detect transient/variable sources and identify solar system objects (SSOs), the processing pipelines require templates of the static sky to perform difference imaging. During the first year of the LSST, templates must be generated as the survey progresses, otherwise SSOs cannot be discovered nightly. The incremental template generation strategy has not been finalized; therefore, we use the Metric Analysis Framework (MAF) and a simulation of the survey cadence (one_snap_v4.0_10yrs}) to explore template generation in Year 1. We have assessed the effects of generating templates over timescales of days-weeks, when at least four images of sufficient quality are available for $\geq90\%$ of the visit. We predict that SSO discoveries will begin $\sim$2-3 months after the start of the survey. We find that the ability of the LSST to discover SSOs in real-time is reduced in Year 1. This is especially true for detections in areas of the sky that receive fewer visits, such as the North Ecliptic Spur (NES), and in less commonly used filters, such as the $u$ and $g$-bands. The lack of templates in the NES dominates the loss of real-time SSO discoveries; across the whole sky the MAF Main-Belt asteroid (MBA) discovery metric decreases by up to $63\%$ compared to the baseline observing strategy, whereas the metric decreases by up to $79\%$ for MBAs in the NES alone.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are usually classified into long/short categories according to their durations, but controversy still exists in this aspect. Here we re-examine the long/short classification of GRBs and further compare the cosmological distribution and evolution of each potential subclass. A large number of $Swift/BAT$ GRBs are analyzed in this study. The Gaussian mixture model is used to fit the duration distribution as well as the joint distribution of duration and hardness ratio, and the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria are adopted to assess the goodness of fit. It is found that three Gaussian components can better fit both the univariate and bivariate distributions, indicating that there are three subclasses in the $Swift/BAT$ GRBs, namely short, intermediate, and long subclasses. The non-parametric Efron-Petrosian and Lynden-Bell's $c^{-}$ methods are used to derive the luminosity function and formation rate from the truncated data of bursts with known redshift in each subclass. It is found that the luminosity distributions and birth rates of the three subclasses are different, further supporting the existence of the intermediate subclass in the $Swift/BAT$ GRBs.

 The Atacama Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) remains unparalleled in sensitivity at radio frequencies above 35 GHz. In this paper, we explore ALMA's potential for narrowband technosignature detection, considering factors such as the interferometer's undistorted field of view, signal dilution due to significant drift rates at high frequencies and the possibility of spectral confusion. We present the first technosignature survey using archival ALMA data in Band 3, focusing on two spectral windows centred on 90.642 GHz and 93.151 GHz. Our survey places new limits at these frequencies on the prevalence of extraterrestrial transmitters for 28 galactic stars, selected from the Gaia DR3 catalogue. We employ a stellar 'bycatch' method to sample these objects within the undistorted field of view of four ALMA calibrators. For the closest star in our sample, we find no evidence of transmitters with EIRP_min > 7 x 10^17 W. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first technosignature search conducted using ALMA data.

 Globular cluster (GC) streams, debris of stars that tidally stripped from their progenitor GCs, have densities that correlate positively with the GC mass loss rate. In this work, we employ a novel particle spray algorithm that can accurately reproduce the morphology of streams of various orbital types, enabling us to uncover the relationship between the GC mass loss history and stream density profiles. Using recent discoveries of GC streams from Gaia DR3, we present, for the first time, direct measurement of mass loss rates for 12 Galactic GCs, ranging from 0.5 to 200 $\rm M_\odot\,Myr^{-1}$. By fitting power-law relations between mass loss rate and key GC properties, we identify positive correlations with GC mass and orbital frequency, consistent with the predictions from N-body simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae, critical for studying cosmic expansion, arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs, but their precise progenitor pathways remain unclear. Growing evidence supports the ``double-degenerate'' scenario, where two white dwarfs interact. The absence of other companion types capable of explaining the observed Ia rate, along with observations of hyper-velocity white dwarfs interpreted as surviving companions of such systems provide compelling evidence in favor of this scenario. Upcoming millihertz gravitational wave observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are expected to detect thousands of double-degenerate systems, though the most compact known candidate Ia progenitors produce only marginally detectable gravitational wave signals. Here, we report observations of ATLAS J1138-5139, a binary white dwarf system with an orbital period of 28 minutes. Our analysis reveals a 1 solar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreting from a helium-core white dwarf. Given its mass, the accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarf is poised to trigger a typical-luminosity Type Ia supernova within a few million years, or to evolve into a stably mass-transferring AM CVn system. ATLAS J1138-5139 provides a rare opportunity to calibrate binary evolution models by directly comparing observed orbital parameters and mass transfer rates closer to merger than any previously identified candidate Type Ia progenitor. Its compact orbit ensures detectability by LISA, demonstrating the potential of millihertz gravitational wave observatories to reveal a population of Type Ia progenitors on a Galactic scale, paving the way for multi-messenger studies offering insights into the origins of these cosmologically significant explosions.

 Presolar grains are stardust particles that condensed in the ejecta or in the outflows of dying stars and can today be extracted from meteorites. They recorded the nucleosynthetic fingerprint of their parent stars and thus serve as valuable probes of these astrophysical sites. The most common types of presolar silicon carbide grains (called mainstream SiC grains) condensed in the outflows of asymptotic giant branch stars. Their measured silicon isotopic abundances are not significantly influenced by nucleosynthesis within the parent star, but rather represents the pristine stellar composition. Silicon isotopes can thus be used as a proxy for galactic chemical evolution. However, the measured correlation of $^{29}$Si/$^{28}$Si versus $^{30}$Si/$^{28}$Si does not agree with any current chemical evolution model. Here, we use a Monte Carlo model to vary nuclear reaction rates within their theoretical or experimental uncertainties and process them through stellar nucleosynthesis and galactic chemical evolution models to study the variation of silicon isotope abundances based on these nuclear reaction rate uncertainties. We find that these uncertainties can indeed be responsible for the discrepancy between measurements and models and that the slope of the silicon isotope correlation line measured in mainstream SiC grains agrees with chemical evolution models within the nuclear reaction rate uncertainties. Our result highlights the importance of future precision reaction rate measurements for resolving the apparent data-model discrepancy.
