 - **Abstract**
 The Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) is a real-time, three-color photometric system designed to capture the color evolution of stars and transients accurately. This telescope system can be crucial in cosmological distance measurements of low-redshift (low-$z$, $z$ $\lesssim 0.1$) Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). To optimize the capabilities of this instrument, we perform a comprehensive simulation study before its official operation is scheduled to start. By considering the impact of atmospheric extinction, weather conditions, and the lunar phase at the observing site involving the instrumental features, we simulate the light curves of SNe Ia obtained by the Mephisto. The best strategy in the case of SN Ia cosmology is to take the image at an exposure time of 130 s with a cadence of 3 days. In this condition, Mephisto can obtain hundreds of high-quality SNe Ia to achieve a distance measurement better than $4.5\%$. Given the on-time spectral classification and monitoring of the Lijiang 2.4 m Telescope at the same observatory, Mephisto, in the whole operation, can significantly enrich the well-calibrated sample of supernovae at low-$z$ and improve the calibration accuracy of high-$z$ SNe Ia.

 - **Abstract**
 By measuring, modeling and interpreting cosmological datasets, one can place strong constraints on models of the Universe. Central to this effort are summary statistics such as power spectra and bispectra, which condense the high-dimensional dataset into low-dimensional representations. In this work, we introduce a modern set of estimators for computing such statistics from three-dimensional clustering data, and provide a flexible Python implementation; PolyBin3D. Working in a maximum-likelihood formalism, we derive general estimators for the two- and three-point functions, which yield unbiased spectra regardless of the survey mask, weighting scheme, and presence of holes in the window function. These can be directly compared to theory without the need for mask-convolution. Furthermore, we present a numerical scheme for computing the optimal (minimum-variance) estimators for a given survey, which is shown to reduce error-bars on large-scales. Our Python package includes both general "unwindowed'' estimators and idealized equivalents (appropriate for simulations), each of which are efficiently implemented using fast Fourier transforms and Monte Carlo summation tricks, and additionally supports GPU acceleration. These are extensively validated in this work, with Monte Carlo convergence (relevant for masked data) achieved using only a small number of iterations (typically $<10$ for bispectra). This will allow for fast and unified measurement of two- and three-point functions from current and upcoming survey data.

 - **Abstract**
 The strong tidal force in a supermassive black hole's (SMBH) vicinity, coupled with a higher stellar density at the center of a galaxy, make it an ideal location to study the interaction between stars and black holes. Two stars moving near the SMBH could collide at a very high speed, which can result in a high energy flare. The resulting debris can then accrete onto the SMBH, which could be observed as a separate event. We simulate the light curves resulting from the fallback accretion in the aftermath of a stellar collision near a SMBH. We investigate how it varies with physical parameters of the system. With all other physical parameters of the system held constant, the direction of the relative velocity vector at time of impact plays a large role in determining the overall form of the light curve. One distinctive light curve we notice is characterized by a sustained increase in the luminosity some time after accretion has started. We compare this form to the light curves of some candidate tidal disruption events (TDEs). Stellar collision accretion flares can take on unique appearances that would allow them to be easily distinguished, as well as elucidate underlying physical parameters of the system. There exist several ways to distinguish these events from TDEs, including the much wider range of SMBH masses stellar collisions may exist around.
#### Hot New Early Dark Energy bridging cosmic gaps: Supercooled phase  transition reconciles (stepped) dark radiation solutions to the Hubble  tension with BBN

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a simple model that can alleviate the $H_0$ tension while remaining consistent with big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). It is based on a dark sector described by a standard Lagrangian featuring a $SU(N)$ gauge symmetry with $N\geq3$ and a massive scalar field with a quartic coupling. The scalar acts as dark Higgs leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking $SU(N)\to SU(N\!-\!1)$ via a first-order phase transition \`a la Coleman-Weinberg. This set-up naturally realizes previously proposed scenarios featuring strongly interacting dark radiation (SIDR) with a mass threshold within hot new early dark energy (NEDE). For a wide range of reasonable model parameters, the phase transition occurs between the BBN and recombination epochs and releases a sufficient amount of latent heat such that the model easily respects bounds on extra radiation during BBN while featuring a sufficient SIDR density around recombination for increasing the value of $H_0$ inferred from the cosmic microwave background. Our model can be summarized as a natural mechanism providing two successive increases in the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom after BBN but before recombination $\Delta N_\mathrm{BBN} \to \Delta N_\mathrm{NEDE} \to \Delta N_\mathrm{IR}$ alleviating the Hubble tension. The first step is related to the phase transition and the second to the dark Higgs becoming non-relativistic. This set-up predicts further signatures, including a stochastic gravitational wave background and features in the matter power spectrum that can be searched for with future pulsar timing and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements.

 Most stars form in clusters and groups rather than in isolation. We present $\lesssim 5^{\prime\prime}$ angular resolution ($\sim 2000$ au, or 0.01 pc) Very Large Array NH$_3$ (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3) and 1.3 cm continuum emission observations of the dense gas within the Serpens South protocluster and extended filaments to the north and south. We identify 94 dense cores using a dendrogram analysis of the NH$_3$ (1,1) integrated intensity. Gas temperatures $T_K$ and non-thermal linewidths $\sigma_\mathrm{NT}$ both increase towards the centre of the young stellar cluster, in the dense gas generally and in the cores specifically. We find that most cores (54\%) are super-virial, with gravitationally bound cores located primarily in the filaments. Cores in the protocluster have higher virial parameters by a factor $\sim 1.7$, driven primarily by the increased core $\sigma_\mathrm{NT}$ values. These cores cannot collapse to form stars unless they accrete additional mass or their core internal motions are reduced. The southern filament shows a significant velocity gradient previously interpreted as mass flow toward the cluster. We find more complex kinematics in the northern filament. We find a strong correlation between $\sigma_\mathrm{NT}$ and $T_K$, and argue that the enhanced temperatures and non-thermal motions are due to mechanical heating and interaction between the protocluster-driven outflows and the dense gas. Filament-led accretion may also contribute to the increased $\sigma_\mathrm{NT}$ values. Assuming a constant fraction of core mass ends up in the young stars, future star formation in the Serpens South protocluster will shift to higher masses by a factor $\sim 2$.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanets in their infancy are ideal targets to probe the formation and evolution history of planetary systems, including the planet migration and atmospheric evolution and dissipation. In this paper, we present spectroscopic observations and analyses of two planetary transits of K2-33b, which is known to be one of the youngest transiting planets (age $\approx 8-11$ Myr) around a pre-main-sequence M-type star. Analysing K2-33's near-infrared spectra obtained by the IRD instrument on Subaru, we investigate the spin-orbit angle and transit-induced excess absorption for K2-33b. We attempt both classical modelling of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect and Doppler-shadow analyses for the measurements of the projected stellar obliquity, finding a low angle of $\lambda=-6_{-58}^{+61}$ deg (for RM analysis) and $\lambda=-10_{-24}^{+22}$ deg (for Doppler-shadow analysis). In the modelling of the RM effect, we allow the planet-to-star radius ratio to float freely to take into account the possible smaller radius in the near infrared, but the constraint we obtain ($R_p/R_s=0.037_{-0.017}^{+0.013}$) is inconclusive due to the low radial-velocity precision. Comparison spectra of K2-33 of the 1083 nm triplet of metastable ortho-He I obtained in and out of the 2021 transit reveal excess absorption that could be due to an escaping He-rich atmosphere. Under certain conditions on planet mass and stellar XUV emission, the implied escape rate is sufficient to remove an Earth-mass H/He in $\sim$1 Gyr, transforming this object from a Neptune to a super-Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiple analytical and empirical stability criteria have been derived in the literature for two planet systems. But, the dependence of the stability limit on the initial mutual inclination between the inner and outer orbits is not well modeled by previous stability criteria. Here, we derive a semi-analytical stability criteria for two planet systems, at arbitrary inclinations, in which the inner planet is a test particle. Using perturbation theory we calculate the characteristic fractional change in the semi-major axis of the inner binary $\beta=\delta a_1/a_1$ caused by perturbations from the companion. A stability criteria can be derived by setting a threshold on $\beta$ Focusing initially on circular orbits, we derive an analytical expression for $\beta$ for co-planar prograde and retrograde orbits. For non-coplanar configurations, we evaluate a semi-analytical expression. We then generalize to orbits with arbitrary eccentricities and account for the secular effects. Our analytical and semi-analytical results are in excellent agreement with direct N-body simulations. In addition, we show that contours of $\beta\sim0.01$ can serve as criteria for stability. More specifically, we show that (1) retrograde orbits are generally more stable than prograde ones; (2) systems with intermediate mutual inclination are less stable due to vZLK dynamics; and (3) mean-motion resonances (MMRs) can stabilize intermediate inclination secularly unstable regions in phase space, by quenching vZLK secular processes (4) MMRs can destabilize some of the dynamically stable regions. We also point out that these stability criteria can be used to constrain the orbital properties of observed systems and their age. We also point out that these stability criteria can be used to constrain the orbital properties of observed systems (in particular inclination) and their age.

 - **Abstract**
 In the contemporary era of high-precision spectroscopic surveys, led by projects like DESI, there is an increasing demand for optimizing the extraction of cosmological information from clustering data. This work conducts a thorough comparison of various methodologies for modeling the full shape of the two-point statistics in configuration space. We investigate the performance of both direct fits (Full-Modeling) and the parameter compression approaches (ShapeFit and Standard). We utilize the ABACUS-SUMMIT simulations, tailored to exceed DESI's precision requirements. Particularly, we fit the two-point statistics of three distinct tracers (LRG, ELG, and QSO), by employing a Gaussian Streaming Model in tandem with Convolution Lagrangian Perturbation Theory and Effective Field Theory. We explore methodological setup variations, including the range of scales, the set of galaxy bias parameters, the inclusion of the hexadecapole, as well as model extensions encompassing varying $n_s$ and allowing for $w_0w_a$CDM dark energy model. Throughout these varied explorations, while precision levels fluctuate and certain configurations exhibit tighter parameter constraints, our pipeline consistently recovers the parameter values of the mocks within $1\sigma$ in all cases for a 1-year DESI volume. Additionally, we compare the performance of configuration space analysis with its Fourier space counterpart using three models: PyBird, FOLPS and velocileptors, presented in companion papers. We find good agreement with the results from all these models.

 - **Abstract**
 Physical properties of ten millimeter-sized meteoroids from the Southern Delta Aquariids (SDA) shower are derived using optical observations from the Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory between 2020 and 2023. The meteors are found to ablate in two distinct erosion stages, the second stage showing a single, bright leading fragment. Our modelling interprets these observations as evidence for equal masses of compact grains embedded in a porous, low density matrix. The average bulk density of SDA meteors is found to be 1,420 $\pm$ 100 $\rm{kg \ m^{-3}}$, with the compact component having a density of 2,310 $\pm$ 160 $\rm{kg \ m^{-3}}$ and the porous component a density of $700\pm110$ $\rm{kg \ m^{-3}}$. The high bulk density of SDA meteors is comparable to densities found for the Quadrantid and Geminid showers, both of which also have low perihelion distances. This suggests that thermal desorption may play a significant role in the processing of meteoroids.
#### Cautionary tales on heating-rate prescriptions in kilonovae

 - **Abstract**
 A major ingredient for kilonova lightcurves is the radioactive heating rate and its dependence on the electron fraction and velocity of the ejecta and, in principle, on the nuclear mass formula. Heating-rate formulae commonly used as the basis for kilonova models are, strictly speaking, incorrect for electron fractions other than $Y_{e} = 0.04$. Here, we introduce new semi-analytical models for kilonovae with better heating rate prescriptions valid for the full parameter space of kilonova velocities and electron fractions. This new prescription produces, on average, dimmer kilonovae at peak that decay more slowly as compared to previously used prescriptions for otherwise identical kilonova physics. We show the dangers of using inappropriate heating rate estimates by simulating realistic observations and inferring the kilonova parameters via a misspecified heating-rate prescription. While providing great fits to the photometry, an incorrect heating-rate prescription fails to recover the input ejecta masses at greater than $5\sigma$. This bias from an incorrect prescription has disastrous consequences for interpreting kilonovae, their use as additional components in gamma-ray burst afterglows, and understanding their role in cosmic chemical evolution or for multi-messenger constraints on the nuclear equation of state. Given the true heating-rate is uncertain, we estimate there is a $\approx 5$ and $\approx 10\%$ systematic uncertainty in the measured ejecta masses and velocities, respectively. For lanthanide-rich ejecta, the systematic uncertainty could be as high as $\approx 50\%$. This systematic uncertainty limits the precision of any measurements that rely on accurate estimates of kilonova ejecta properties.
#### A comparison of effective field theory models of redshift space galaxy  power spectra for DESI 2024 and future surveys

 - **Abstract**
 In preparation for the next generation of galaxy redshift surveys, and in particular the year-one data release from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we investigate the consistency of a variety of effective field theory models that describe the galaxy-galaxy power spectra in redshift space into the quasi-linear regime using 1-loop perturbation theory. These models are employed in the pipelines \texttt{velocileptors}, \texttt{PyBird}, and \texttt{Folps$\nu$}. While these models have been validated independently, a detailed comparison with consistent choices has not been attempted. After briefly discussing the theoretical differences between the models we describe how to provide a more apples-to-apples comparison between them. We present the results of fitting mock spectra from the \texttt{AbacusSummit} suite of N-body simulations provided in three redshift bins to mimic the types of dark time tracers targeted by the DESI survey. We show that the theories behave similarly and give consistent constraints in both the forward-modeling and ShapeFit compressed fitting approaches. We additionally generate (noiseless) synthetic data from each pipeline to be fit by the others, varying the scale cuts in order to show that the models agree within the range of scales for which we expect 1-loop perturbation theory to be applicable. This work lays the foundation of Full-Shape analysis with DESI Y1 galaxy samples where in the tests we performed, we found no systematic error associated with the modeling of the galaxy redshift space power spectrum for this volume.
#### An analysis of parameter compression and full-modeling techniques with  Velocileptors for DESI 2024 and beyond

 - **Abstract**
 In anticipation of forthcoming data releases of current and future spectroscopic surveys, we present the validation tests and analysis of systematic effects within \texttt{velocileptors} modeling pipeline when fitting mock data from the \texttt{AbacusSummit} N-body simulations. We compare the constraints obtained from parameter compression methods to the direct fitting (Full-Modeling) approaches of modeling the galaxy power spectra, and show that the ShapeFit extension to the traditional template method is consistent with the Full-Modeling method within the standard $\Lambda$CDM parameter space. We show the dependence on scale cuts when fitting the different redshift bins using the ShapeFit and Full-Modeling methods. We test the ability to jointly fit data from multiple redshift bins as well as joint analysis of the pre-reconstruction power spectrum with the post-reconstruction BAO correlation function signal. We further demonstrate the behavior of the model when opening up the parameter space beyond $\Lambda$CDM and also when combining likelihoods with external datasets, namely the Planck CMB priors. Finally, we describe different parametrization options for the galaxy bias, counterterm, and stochastic parameters, and employ the halo model in order to physically motivate suitable priors that are necessary to ensure the stability of the perturbation theory.
#### Effects of dynamical friction on perturbations for evolving dark energy

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the impact of dynamical friction on cosmological scales and show its influence on the evolution of perturbations. In particular, considering smooth and clustering dark energy models, we describe the role played by friction by selecting two main hierarchical models, \textit{i.e.}, the first where the friction term is proportional to the Hubble rate, whereas the second where friction is induced by the dark energy pressure. The second approach generalises the first and translates the idea that pressure is a general relativistic effect, motivating why friction might arise once barotropic dark energy fluids are considered. The corresponding effects of friction are investigated at the level of linear and nonlinear perturbations, using the formalism of the spherical collapse model. Whilst dynamical friction has very small effects and thus it cannot be excluded \emph{a priori}, dissipative pressure friction leads to a substantial slow down in the evolution of perturbations. This can be particularly inferred within the halo mass function, for which we also employ corrections due to dark energy clustering. To this end, in order to discern detectable deviations from the standard cosmological model, we thus highlight where dissipation effects might play a significant role at large scales.
#### Closing the stellar labels gap: Stellar label independent evidence for  [$α$/M] information in $\textit{Gaia}$ BP/RP spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Data-driven models for stellar spectra which depend on stellar labels suffer from label systematics which decrease model performance: the "stellar labels gap". To close the stellar labels gap, we present a stellar label independent model for $\textit{Gaia}$ BP/RP (XP) spectra. We develop a novel implementation of a variational auto-encoder; a $\textit{scatter}$ VAE, which learns to generate an XP spectrum and intrinsic scatter without relying on stellar labels. We demonstrate that our model achieves competitive XP spectra reconstructions in comparison to stellar label dependent models. We find that our model learns stellar properties directly from the data itself. We then apply our model to XP/APOGEE giant stars to study the [$\alpha$/M] information in $\textit{Gaia}$ XP. We provide strong evidence that the XP spectra contain meaningful [$\alpha$/M] information by demonstrating that our model learns the $\alpha$-bimodality $\textit{without relying on stellar label correlations}$, for stars with $T_{\rm eff} <$ 5000 K. We publicly release our trained model, codebase and data. Importantly, our stellar label independent model can be implemented for any/all XP spectra because our model performance scales with training object density, not training label density.
#### Proto-Neutron Star Convection and the Neutrino-Driven Wind: Implications  for the $ν$p-Process

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies of the neutrino-driven wind from proto-neutron stars have indicated that the wind is likely proton-rich for much of its lifetime, and the high flux of neutrinos can induce $\nu$p-process nucleosynthesis allowing for the formation of heavy elements. It has also been shown that gravito-acoustic waves, generated by convection within the proto-neutron star, can significantly alter the dynamics and nucleosynthesis in the wind. Therefore, we present a study of the effects of convection-driven waves on the nucleosynthesis in proton-rich neutrino-driven winds, focusing on the $\nu$p-process. We find that wave effects can strongly impact $\nu$p-process nucleosynthesis even at wave luminosities a factor of $10^{-5}$ smaller than the total neutrino luminosity. The momentum flux of the waves accelerates the wind, reducing the net neutrino heating and the persistent neutron abundance created by p($\bar{\nu}_e,e^+$), which impedes $\nu$p-process nucleosynthesis. However, this effect is generally counteracted by the effects of waves on seed nucleus formation, as the acceleration of the wind and the heating that occurs as these waves shock both favor a more $\alpha$-rich environment with very little heavy seed-nucleus formation. Overall, higher wave luminosities correlate (albeit non-monotonically) with heavier element $\nu$p-processing, up to $A\approx 200$ in some cases. At very high wave luminosities ($\gtrsim 10^{-3}L_\nu$), early shock heating by the waves disrupts $\alpha$ recombination, and drives a suppressed, fast-outflow r-process proceeding up to $A\approx 200$. This occurs despite an assumed neutrino spectrum that predicts a proton-rich wind with equilibrium $Y_e=0.6$.
#### Recovering the gas properties of protoplanetary disks through parametric  visibility modeling: MHO 6

 - **Abstract**
 The composition and distribution of the gas in a protoplanetary disk plays a key role in shaping the outcome of the planet formation process. Observationally, the recovery of information such as the emission height and brightness temperature from interferometric data is often limited by the imaging processes. To overcome the limitations of image-reconstruction when analyzing gas emission from interferometric observations, we have introduced a parametric model to fit the main observable properties of the gaseous disk component in the visibility plane. This approach is also known as parametric visibility modeling. We applied our parametric visibility modeling to the gas brightness distribution of the molecular line emission from 12CO J=3-2 and 13CO J=3-2 in the disk around MHO 6, a very-low-mass star in the Taurus star-forming Region. To improve the flux fidelity of our parametric models, we combined models with different pixel resolution before the computation of their visibilities, referred to as ``nesting images.'' When we apply our parametric visibility modeling to MHO 6, with independent fits to the emission from its CO isopotologues, the models return the same consistent results for the stellar mass, disk geometry, and central velocity. The surface height and brightness temperature distribution are also recovered. When compared to other disks, MHO 6 surface height is among the most elevated surfaces, consistent with the predictions for disks around very-low-mass stars. This work demonstrates the feasibility of running rapidly iterable parametric visibility models in moderate resolution and sensitivity interferometric observations. More importantly, this methodology opens the analysis of disk's gas morphology to observations where image-based techniques are unable to robustly operate, as in the case of the compact disk around MHO 6.

 - **Abstract**
 The ALMA-IMF Large Program provides multi-tracer observations of 15 Galactic massive protoclusters at matched sensitivity and spatial resolution. We focus on the dense gas kinematics of the G353.41 protocluster traced by N$_2$H$^+$ (1$-$0), with a critical density of $2\times10^5$~cm$^{-3}$, and spatial resolution $\sim$0.02~pc. G353.41, at a distance of 2~kpc, is embedded in a larger scale ($\sim$8~pc) filament and has a mass of 2500~M$_{\odot}$ within $1.3\times1.3$~pc$^2$. We extract the N$_2$H$^+$ isolated line component and we decompose it by fitting up to 3 Gaussian velocity components. This allows us to identify velocity structures that are either muddled or impossible to identify in the traditional position-velocity diagram. We identify multiple velocity gradients (VGs) on large and small scales. We find good agreement between the N$_2$H$^+$ and the previously reported DCN core velocities, suggesting that cores are kinematically coupled to the dense gas in which they form. We measure 9 converging V-shaped VGs, located in filaments, that are sometimes associated with cores near their point of convergence. The average timescale associated with the V-shapes are $\sim$67~kyr, or about twice the free-fall time of cores in the same area ($\sim$~33~kyr) but substantially shorter than protostar lifetime estimates ($\sim$~0.5~Myr). We interpret these V-shapes as inflowing gas feeding the regions near cores and we derive their mass accretion rates. This feeding might lead to further filament collapse and formation of new cores. We suggest that the protocluster is collapsing on large scales, but the velocity signature of collapse is slow compared to pure free-fall. Thus these data are consistent with a comparatively slow global protocluster contraction under gravity, and faster core formation within, suggesting the formation of multiple generations of stars over the protocluster lifetime.

 Context. Time-series photometry has given astronomers the tools to study time-dependent astrophysical phenomena, from stellar activity to fast radio bursts and exoplanet transits. Transit events in particular are focused primarily on planetary transits, and eclipsing binaries with eclipse geometries that are parameterised with a few variables, while more complex light curves caused by substructure within the transiting object require customized analysis code. Aims. We present Beyond Circular Eclipsers (BeyonCE), which reduces the parameter space encompassed by the transit of circum-secondary disc (CSD) systems with azimuthally symmetric non-uniform optical depth profiles. By rejecting disc geometries that cannot reproduce the measured gradients within their light curves, we can constrain the size and orientation of discs with complex sub-structure. Methods. We map out all the possible geometries of a disc, calculate the gradients for rings crossing the star, then reject those configurations where the measured gradient of the light curve is greater than the theoretical gradient from the given disc orientation. Results. We present the fitting code BeyonCE and demonstrate its effectiveness in considerably reducing the parameter space of discs that contain azimuthally symmetric structure by analyzing the light curves seen towards J1407 and PDS 110 which are attributed to CSD transits.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalogue of white dwarf candidates constructed from the GALEX and Gaia EDR3 catalogues. The catalogue contains 332,111 candidate binary white dwarf systems and 111,996 candidate single white dwarfs. Where available, the catalogue is augmented with photometry from Pan-STARRS DR1, SDSS DR12 and classifications from StarHorse. We fit photometric data with modeled white dwarf cooling sequences to derive mass, age and effective temperature of the white dwarf as well as mass estimates for the companion. We test our classifications against StarHorse, the Gentile-Fusillo Gaia EDR3 catalogue, and white-dwarf-main-sequence binaries identified in SDSS DR12. This catalogue provides a unique probe of the binarity of white dwarfs as well as the abundance of white-dwarf giant binaries and large mass-ratio stellar binaries which are difficult to probe otherwise.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate age estimation of nearby young moving groups (NYMGs) is important as they serve as crucial testbeds in various fields of astrophysics, including formation and evolution of stars, planets, as well as loose stellar associations. The $\beta$-Pictoris moving group (BPMG), being one of the closest and youngest NYMGs, has been extensively investigated, and its estimated ages have a wide range from $\sim$10 to 25 Myr, depending on the age estimation methods and data used. Unlike other age dating methods, kinematic traceback analysis offers a model-independent age assessment hence the merit in comparing many seemingly discordant age estimates. In this study, we determine the kinematic ages of the BPMG using three methods: probabilistic volume calculation, mean pairwise distance calculation, and covariance matrix analysis. These methods yield consistent results, with estimated ages in the range of 14 to 20 Myr. Implementing corrections to radial velocities due to gravitational redshift and convectional blueshift increases the ages by $\sim2-4$ Myr. Conversely, considering data uncertainties decreases the estimated ages by 1 to 2 Myr. Taken together, our analysis determined the kinematic age of BPMG to be 16.3$^{+3.4}_{-2.1}$ Myr. This age is significantly younger than the commonly accepted age of the BPMG ($\sim$24 Myr) determined primarily from the lithium depletion boundary analysis. This younger kinematic age may point to the discrepancy between the luminosity evolution and lithium depletion models or the presence of unaccounted systematic error in the method. This result underscores the necessity for systematic reevaluations of age-dating methods for nearby, young moving groups.

 - **Abstract**
 Among the silicon bearing species discovered in the interstellar medium, SiS and SiO stand out as key tracers due to their distinct chemistry and abundances in interstellar and circumstellar environments. Our objective is to enhance the network of Si- and S-bearing chemical reactions for a gas-grain model in molecular clouds, encompassing both low and high metallicities. We have calculated the energies and rate coefficients for 6 neutral atom-diatom reactions involved in the SiCS triatomic system, with a special focus on the C+SiS and S+SiC collisions. We employ the coupled cluster method with single and double substitutions and a perturbative treatment of triple substitutions (CCSD(T)) refined at the explicitly correlated CCSD(T)-F12 level. With these computational results in conjunction with data from the literature, we construct an extended network of neutral-neutral chemical reactions. We performed time-dependent models employing the Nautilus gas-grain code, setting the gas temperature to 10 K and the density to 2x10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$. The temperature dependence for the reactions involving SiS were modelled using $k(T)=\alpha \left( T/300 \right)^{\beta} \exp{(-\gamma/T)}$. The high-metallicity models significantly boost the SiS production. Higher initial abundances of C, S, and Si, roughly $\sim$2, 190, and 210 times higher, respectively, contribute to this. Around 10$^3$ yr, destruction mechanisms become relevant. The proposed production reaction S + SiC $\rightarrow$ C + SiS, mitigates these effects. By expanding the gas reaction network using a high metallicity model, we derived estimates for the abundances of interstellar molecules. The inclusion of neutral-neutral mechanisms, particularly via Si+HS and S+SiC channels, played a pivotal role in determining SiS abundance. These mechanisms carry a significance on a par with the well-known and fast ion-neutral reactions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Sydney Radio Star Catalogue, a new catalogue of stars detected at megahertz to gigahertz radio frequencies. It consists of 839 unique stars with 3,405 radio detections, more than doubling the previously known number of radio stars. We have included stars from large area searches for radio stars found using circular polarisation searches, cross-matching, variability searches, and proper motion searches as well as presenting hundreds of newly detected stars from our search of Australian SKA Pathfinder observations. The focus of this first version of the catalogue is on objects detected in surveys using SKA precursor instruments; however we will expand this scope in future versions. The 839 objects in the Sydney Radio Star Catalogue are distributed across the whole sky and range from ultracool dwarfs to Wolf-Rayet stars. We find that the radio luminosities of cool dwarfs are lower than the radio luminosities of more evolved sub-giant and giant stars. We use X-ray detections of 530 radio stars by the eROSITA soft X-ray instrument onboard the SRG spacecraft to show that almost all of the radio stars in the catalogue are over-luminous in the radio, indicating that the majority of stars at these radio frequencies are coherent radio emitters. The Sydney Radio Star Catalogue can be found in Vizier or at https://radiostars.org.
#### Supernova 1987A's keyhole: A long-lived jet-pair in the final explosion  phase of core-collapse supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 I further study the manner by which a pair of opposite jets shape the `keyhole' morphological structure of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 1997A, now the CCSN remnant (CCSNR) 1987A. By doing so, I strengthen the claim that the jittering-jet explosion mechanism (JJEM) accounts for most, likely all, CCSNe. The `keyhole' structure comprises a northern low-intensity zone closed with a bright rim on its front and an elongated low-intensity nozzle in the south. This rim-nozzle asymmetry is observed in some cooling flow clusters and planetary nebulae that are observed to be shaped by jets. I build a toy model that uses the planar jittering jets pattern, where consecutive pairs of jets tend to jitter in a common plane, implying that the accreted gas onto the newly born neutron star at the late explosion phase flows perpendicular to that plane. This allows for a long-lived jet-launching episode. This long-lasting jet-launching episode launches more mass into the jets that can inflate larger pairs of ears or bubbles, forming the main jets' axis of the CCSNR that is not necessarily related to a possible pre-collapse core rotation. I discuss the relation of the main jets' axis to the neutron star's natal kick velocity.

 - **Abstract**
 GG Tau is one of the most studied multiple young stellar systems: GG Tau A is a hierarchical triple surrounded by a massive disc and its companion, GG Tau B, is also a binary. Despite numerous observational attempts, an understanding of the geometry of the GG Tau A system is still elusive. We provide new astrometric measures of the system and we run a set of hydrodynamical simulations with two representative orbits to test how they impact a disc composed of dust and gas. We test the dynamical evolution of the two scenarios on short and long timescales. We obtain synthetic flux emission from our simulations and we compare them with 1300 $\mu$m ALMA dust continuum emission and 1.67 $\mu$m SPHERE dust scattering images to infer the most likely orbital arrangement. We extend the analysis of the binary orbital parameters using six new epochs from archival data, showing that the current measurements alone are not capable of breaking the degeneracy between families of coplanar and misaligned orbits. We found that the time-scale for the onset of the disc eccentricity growth, $\tau_{ecc}$, is a fundamental time-scale for the morphology of the system. Results from numerical simulations show that the best match between is obtained with the misaligned configuration ($\Delta\theta= 30^\circ$) on timescales shorter than $\tau_{ecc}$. The results exhibit an almost circular cavity and dust ring. However, for both scenarios, the cavity size and its eccentricity quickly grow for timescales longer than $\tau_{ecc}$ and the models do not reproduce the observed morphology anymore. This implies that either the age of the system is shorter than $\tau_{ecc}$ or that the disc eccentricity growth is not triggered or dissipated. This finding raises questions on the future evolution of the GG Tau A system and, more in general, on the time evolution of eccentric binaries and their circumbinary discs.
#### Evolution of rotating massive stars adopting a newer, self-consistent  wind prescription at SMC metallicity

 - **Abstract**
 We use Geneva-evolution-code to run evolutionary tracks for stellar masses ranging from $20$ to $85$ $M_\odot$ at SMC metallicity ($Z=0.002$). We upgrade the recipe for stellar winds by adopting our self-consistent m-CAK prescription, which reduces the value of mass-loss rate by a factor between 2 and 6 depending on the mass range. The impact of our new winds is wide, and it can be divided between direct and indirect impact. For the most massive models ($60$ and $85$ $M_\odot$) with $\dot M\gtrsim2\times10^{-7}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, the impact is direct because lower mass loss make stars remove less envelope and therefore remain more massive and less chemically enriched at their surface at the end of their MS phase. For the less massive models ($20$ and $25$ $M_\odot$) with $\dot M\lesssim2\times10^{-8}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, the impact is indirect because lower mass loss make the stars keep high rotational velocities for a longer period of time, then extending the H-core burning lifetime and reaching the end of the MS with higher surface enrichment. Given that the conditions at the H-depletion change, the stars will lose more mass during their He-core burning stages anyways. For $M_\text{zams}=20$ to $40$ $M_\odot$, our models predict stars will evolve through the Hertzsprung gap, from O-type supergiants to BSG and finally RSG, with larger mass fractions of helium compared to old evolution models. New models also set down to $M_\text{zams}=85\,M_\odot$ the minimal initial mass required for a single star to become WR at metallicity $Z=0.002$. New values for $\dot M$ need to be complemented with upgrades in additional features such as convective core overshooting and distribution of rotational velocities, besides more detailed observations from projects such as XShootU, in order to provide a robust framework for the study of massive stars at low metallicity environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of CH$_3$CH$_2$CCH, CH$_3$CH$_2$CN, CH$_2$CHCCH, and CH$_2$CHCN in TMC-1 using the QUIJOTE$^1$ line survey. We confirm the presence of CH$_3$CH$_2$CCH in TMC-1, which was previously reported as tentative by our group. From a detailed study of the ethynyl and cyanide derivatives of CH$_2$CH$_2$ and CH$_3$CH$_3$ in TMC-1, we found that the CH$_2$CHCCH/CH$_2$CHCN and CH$_3$CH$_2$CCH/CH$_3$CH$_2$CN abundance ratios are 1.5$\pm$0.1 and 4.8$\pm$0.5, respectively. The derived CH$_2$CHCCH/CH$_3$CH$_2$CCH abundance ratio is 15.3$\pm$0.8, and that of CH$_2$CHCN over CH$_3$CH$_2$CN is 48$\pm$5. All the single substituted isotopologs of vinyl cyanide have been detected, and we found that the first and second carbon substitutions in CH$_2$CHCN provide a $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio in line with that found for other three-carbon bearing species such as HCCNC and HNCCC. However, the third $^{13}$C isotopolog, CH$_2$CH$^{13}$CN, presents an increase in its abundance similar to that found for HCCCN. Finally, we observed eight $b$-type transitions of CH$_2$CHCN, and we find that their intensity cannot be fitted adopting the dipole moment $\mu_b$ derived previously. These transitions involve the same rotational levels as those of the $a$-type transitions. From their intensity, we obtain $\mu_b$=0.80$\pm$0.03\,D, which is found to be in between earlier values derived in the laboratory using intensity measurements or the Stark effect. Our chemical model indicates that the abundances of CH$_3$CH$_2$CCH, CH$_3$CH$_2$CN, CH$_2$CHCCH, and CH$_2$CHCN observed in TMC-1 can be explained in terms of gas-phase reactions.

 - **Abstract**
 Hub-filament systems (HFSs) being the potential sites of formation of star clusters and high mass stars, provide a test bed for the current theories that attempt to explain star formation globally. It is thus important to study a large number of HFSs using both intensity and velocity information to constrain these objects better observationally. We present here a study of the hub-filament system associated with G6.55-0.1 using newly obtained observations of radio continuum and $J$=2--1 transition of CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O. The radio continuum maps show multiple peaks that coincide with far-infrared dust continuum peaks indicating the presence of more than one young massive stars in the hub of the HFS. We used the velocity information from the C$^{18}$O(2--1) map to (a) show that the source G6.55-0.1 is not physically associated with the SNR W28 and (b) disentangle and identify the velocity components genuinely associated with G6.55-0.1. Among the velocity-coherent structures identified, the two filaments at 13.8 and 17.3 km s$^{-1}$ contribute a total mass accretion rate of $\sim$3000 M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ to the hub. Both the filaments also show V-shaped structure, characteristic of gravitational collapse, in their velocity profile at the location of the hub. Estimated mass per unit length of the segments of the filaments are smaller than the critical line masses derived from virial equilibrium considerations. This suggests that while the filaments are not gravitationally collapsing as a whole, the spectra from the hub indicate that the inner parts are dynamically decoupled and collapsing to form stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We study Monge-Amp\`ere gravity (MAG) as an effective theory of cosmological structure formation through optimal transport theory. MAG is based on the Monge-Amp\`ere equation, a nonlinear version of the Poisson equation, that relates the Hessian determinant of the potential to the density field. We explain how MAG emerges from a conditioned system of independent and indistinguishable Brownian particles, through the large deviation principle, in the continuum limit. To numerically explore this highly non-linear theory, we develop a novel N-body simulation method based on semi-discrete optimal transport. Our results obtained from the very first N-body simulation of Monge-Amp\`ere gravity with over 100 millions particles show that on large scales, Monge-Amp\`ere gravity is similar to the Newtonian gravity but favours the formation of anisotropic structures such as filaments. At small scales, MAG has a weaker clustering and is screened in high-density regions. Although here we study the Monge-Amp\`ere gravity as an effective rather than a fundamental theory, our novel highly-performant optimal transport algorithm can be used to run high-resolution simulations of a large class of modified theories of gravity, such as Galileons, in which the equations of motion are second-order and of Monge-Amp\`ere type.

 - **Abstract**
 A substantial fraction of quasars display broad absorption lines (BALs) in their rest-frame ultraviolet spectra. While the origin of BALs is thought to be related to the accretion disc wind, it remains unclear whether the observed ratio of BAL to non-BAL quasars is due to orientation. We conducted observations of 48 BAL quasars and the same number of non-BAL quasars at 322 MHz using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. Combined with previous flux measurements ranging from MHz to GHz frequencies, we compared continuum radio spectra between the two quasar groups. These data offer insights into low-frequency radio properties that have been difficult to investigate with previous observations only at GHz frequencies. Our results present that $73\pm13$ per cent of the BAL quasars exhibit steep or peaked spectra, a higher proportion than $44 \pm 14$ per cent observed in the non-BAL quasars. In contrast, there are no discernible differences between the two quasar groups in the radio luminosity, peak frequency, and spectral index distributions of sources with steep or peaked spectra and sources with flat or inverted spectra. Generally, as the jet axis and line of sight become closer to parallel, quasars exhibit flat or inverted spectra rather than steep or peaked ones. Therefore, these results suggest that BAL quasars are more frequently observed farther from the jet axis than non-BAL quasars. However, given that a certain proportion of BAL quasars exhibit flat or inverted spectra, more than the simple orientation scenario is required to elucidate the radio properties of BAL quasars.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia satellite has provided the community with three releases containing astrometrical and photometric data as well as by products, such as stellar parameters and variability indicators. By selecting in the Gaia database, one can select stars with the requested characteristics, such as high speed. At present any selection is based on available Gaia releases including a subset of the observations. This, for some stars, can show some limitations, for example there is still not a sufficient number of observations to detect binarity. We investigated a star selected in Gaia EDR3 for its high speed that appears unbound to the Galaxy. We requested high-quality spectra to derive more information on the star. {From the spectroscopic investigation we confirm the low metallicity content of the star, and we derive a detailed chemical composition. The star is poor in carbon and very rich in oxygen: [(C+N+O)/Fe]=+0.65. From the two spectra observed we conclude that the star is in a binary system and from the investigation of the ionisation balance we derive that the star is closer than implied by the Gaia DR3 parallax, and thus has a a lower intrinsic luminosity. The star is probably still unbound, but there is the possibility that it is bound to the Galaxy. Its low carbon abundance suggests that the star was formed in a dwarf galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The 1RXS J034231.8+121622 system consists of an M dwarf primary and a directly imaged low-mass stellar companion. We use high resolution spectroscopic data from Keck/KPIC to estimate the objects' atmospheric parameters and radial velocities (RVs). Using PHOENIX stellar models, we find that the primary has a temperature of 3460 $\pm$ 50 K a metallicity of 0.16 $\pm$ 0.04, while the secondary has a temperature of 2510 $\pm$ 50 K and a metallicity of $0.13\substack{+0.12 \\ -0.11}$. Recent work suggests this system is associated with the Hyades, placing it an older age than previous estimates. Both metallicities agree with current $[Fe/H]$ Hyades measurements (0.11 -- 0.21). Using stellar evolutionary models, we obtain significantly higher masses for the objects, of 0.30 $\pm$ 0.15 $M_\odot$ and 0.08 $\pm$ 0.01 $M_\odot$ (84 $\pm$ 11 $M_{Jup}$) respectively. Using the RVs and a new astrometry point from Keck/NIRC2, we find that the system is likely an edge-on, moderately eccentric ($0.41\substack{+0.27 \\ -0.08}$) configuration. We also estimate the C/O ratio of both objects using custom grid models, obtaining 0.42 $\pm$ 0.10 (primary) and 0.55 $\pm$ 0.10 (companion). From these results, we confirm that this system most likely went through a binary star formation process in the Hyades. The significant changes in this system's parameters since its discovery highlight the importance of high resolution spectroscopy for both orbital and atmospheric characterization of directly imaged companions.

 For segmented telescopes, achieving fine co-focus adjustment is essential for realizing co-phase adjustment and maintenance, which involves adjusting the millimeter-scale piston between segments to fall within the capture range of the co-phase detection system. CGST proposes using a SHWFS for piston detection during the co-focus adjustment stage. However, the residual piston after adjustment exceeds the capture range of the broadband PSF phasing algorithm$(\pm 30 \mu m) $, and the multi-wavelength PSF algorithm requires even higher precision in co-focus adjustment. To improve the co-focus adjustment accuracy of CGST, a fine co-focus adjustment based on cross-calibration is proposed. This method utilizes a high-precision detector to calibrate and fit the measurements from the SHWFS, thereby reducing the impact of atmospheric turbulence and systematic errors on piston measurement accuracy during co-focus adjustment. Simulation results using CGST demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances adjustment accuracy compared to the SHWFS detection method. Additionally, the residual piston after fine co-focus adjustment using this method falls within the capture range of the multi-wavelength PSF algorithm. To verify the feasibility of this method, experiments were conducted on an 800mm ring segmented mirror system, successfully achieving fine co-focus adjustment where the remaining piston of all segments fell within $\pm 15 \mu m$.

 - **Abstract**
 A compact source, G0.02467-0.0727, was detected in ALMA \threemm observations in continuum and very broad line emission. The continuum emission has a spectral index $\alpha\approx3.3$, suggesting that the emission is from dust. The line emission is detected in several transitions of CS, SO, and SO$_2$ and exhibits a line width FWHM $\approx160$ \kms. The line profile appears Gaussian. The emission is weakly spatially resolved, coming from an area on the sky $\lesssim1"$ in diameter ($\lesssim10^4$ AU at the distance of the Galactic Center; GC). The centroid velocity is $v_{LSR}\approx40$-$50$ \kms, which is consistent with a location in the Galactic Center. With multiple SO lines detected, and assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions, $T_\mathrm{LTE} = 13$ K, which is colder than seen in typical GC clouds, though we cannot rule out low-density, subthermally excited, warmer gas. Despite the high velocity dispersion, no emission is observed from SiO, suggesting that there are no strong ($\gtrsim10~\mathrm{km~s}^{-1}$) shocks in the molecular gas. There are no detections at other wavelengths, including X-ray, infrared, and radio. We consider several explanations for the Millimeter Ultra-Broad Line Object (MUBLO), including protostellar outflow, explosive outflow, collapsing cloud, evolved star, stellar merger, high-velocity compact cloud, intermediate mass black hole, and background galaxy. Most of these conceptual models are either inconsistent with the data or do not fully explain it. The MUBLO is, at present, an observationally unique object.

 - **Abstract**
 The Lagoon Nebula (M8) is host to multiple regions with recent and ongoing massive star formation. With M8-Main and M8 East, two prominent regions of massive star formation have been studied in detail over the past years, while large parts of the nebula have received little attention. These largely unexplored regions comprise a large sample of molecular clumps that are affected by the presence of massive O- and B-type stars. We establish an inventory of species observed towards 37 known molecular clumps in M8 by conducting an unbiased line survey for each clump. For this, we used APEX and the IRAM 30m telescope for pointed on-off observations on the clumps. These observations cover bandwidths of 53GHz and 40GHz in frequency ranges from 210GHz to 280GHz and from 70GHz to 117GHz, respectively. Temperatures are derived from rotational transitions of CH3CN, CH3C2H and para-H2CO. Additional archival data from the Spitzer, Herschel, MSX, APEX, WISE, JCMT and AKARI telescopes are used to derive physical parameters of the dust emission by fitting spectral energy distributions to the observed flux densities. Across the observed M8 region, we identify 346 transitions from 70 different molecular species, including isotopologues. We detect tracers of photo-dissociation regions across all the clumps and 38% of these clumps show signs of star formation. We find that PDR tracers are most abundant in clumps with relatively lower H2 column densities. When comparing M8 clumps to ATLASGAL sources at similar distances, we find them to be slightly less massive and have compatible luminosities and radii. This possibly indicates a fragmentation of the gas caused by the O- and B-type stars. In contrast, dust temperatures of the clumps in M8 are found to be increased by approximately 5K (25%) indicating substantial external heating of the clumps by radiation of the present massive stars.
