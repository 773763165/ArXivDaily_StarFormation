 - **Abstract**
 Recently, pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations, including NANOGrav, have reported evidence of a stochastic gravitational wave background within the nHz frequency range.\ It can be interpreted by gravitational waves from preheating era. In this context, we demonstrate that the emission of this stochastic gravitational wave background can be attributed to fluctuations occurring at the end of inflation, thus giving rise to the Hubble tension issue. At the onset of inflation, the value of the frequency of the gravitational wave signal stood at $f=0.08nHz$, but it rapidly transitioned to $f=1nHz$ precisely at the end of inflation. However, just before the end of inflation, a phase characterized by curvature perturbation is known to occur, causing a swift increase in the frequency.

 - **Abstract**
 The ANAIS experiment is intended to search for dark matter annual modulation with ultrapure NaI(Tl) scintillators in order to provide a model independent confirmation or refutation of the long-standing DAMA/LIBRA positive annual modulation signal in the low energy detection rate, using the same target and technique. Other experiments exclude the region of parameters singled out by DAMA/LIBRA. However, these experiments use different target materials, so the comparison of their results depends on the models assumed for the dark matter particle and its distribution in the galactic halo. ANAIS-112, consisting of nine 12.5 kg NaI(Tl) modules produced by Alpha Spectra Inc., disposed in a 3$\times$3 matrix configuration, is taking data smoothly with excellent performance at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory, Spain, since August, 2017. Last published results corresponding to three-year exposure were compatible with the absence of modulation and incompatible with DAMA/LIBRA for a sensitivity above 2.5$\sigma$ C.L. Present status of the experiment and a reanalysis of the first 3 years data using new filtering protocols based on machine-learning techniques are reported. This reanalysis allows to improve the sensitivity previously achieved for the DAMA/LIBRA signal. Updated sensitivity prospects are also presented: with the improved filtering, testing the DAMA/LIBRA signal at 5$\sigma$ will be within reach in 2025.

 This document describes BinCodex, a common format for the output of binary population synthesis (BPS) codes agreed upon by the members of the LISA Synthetic UCB Catalogue Group. The goal of the format is to provide a common reference framework to describe the evolution of a single, isolated binary system or a population of isolated binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 Chain inflation is an alternative to slow-roll inflation in which the inflaton tunnels along a large number of consecutive minima in its potential. In this work we perform the first comprehensive calculation of the gravitational wave spectrum of chain inflation. In contrast to slow-roll inflation the latter does not stem from quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field during inflation, but rather from the bubble collisions during the first-order phase transitions associated with vacuum tunneling. Our calculation is performed within an effective theory of chain inflation which builds on an expansion of the tunneling rate capturing most of the available model space. The effective theory can be seen as chain inflation's analogue of the slow-roll expansion in rolling models of inflation. We show that chain inflation produces a very characteristic double-peak spectrum: a faint high-frequency peak associated with the gravitational radiation emitted during inflation, and a strong low-frequency peak associated with the graceful exit from chain inflation (marking the transition to the radiation-dominated epoch). There exist very exciting prospects to test the gravitational wave signal from chain inflation at the aLIGO-aVIRGO-KAGRA network, at LISA and /or at pulsar timing array experiments. A particularly intriguing possibility we point out is that chain inflation could be the source of the stochastic gravitational wave background recently detected by NANOGrav, PPTA, EPTA and CPTA. We also show that the gravitational wave signal of chain inflation is often accompanied by running/ higher running of the scalar spectral index to be tested at future Cosmic Microwave Background experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 We test Milgromian dynamics (MOND) using wide binary stars (WBs) with separations of $2-30$ kAU. Locally, the WB orbital velocity in MOND should exceed the Newtonian prediction by $\approx 20\%$ at asymptotically large separations given the Galactic external field effect (EFE). We investigate this with a detailed statistical analysis of \emph{Gaia} DR3 data on 8611 WBs within 250 pc of the Sun. Orbits are integrated in a rigorously calculated gravitational field that directly includes the EFE. We also allow line of sight contamination and undetected close binary companions to the stars in each WB. We interpolate between the Newtonian and Milgromian predictions using the parameter $\alpha_{\rm{grav}}$, with 0 indicating Newtonian gravity and 1 indicating MOND. Directly comparing the best Newtonian and Milgromian models reveals that Newtonian dynamics is preferred at $19\sigma$ confidence. Using a complementary Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, we find that $\alpha_{\rm{grav}} = -0.021^{+0.065}_{-0.045}$, which is fully consistent with Newtonian gravity but excludes MOND at $16\sigma$ confidence. This is in line with the similar result of Pittordis and Sutherland using a somewhat different sample selection and less thoroughly explored population model. We show that although our best-fitting model does not fully reproduce the observations, an overwhelmingly strong preference for Newtonian gravity remains in a considerable range of variations to our analysis. Adapting the MOND interpolating function to explain this result would cause tension with rotation curve constraints. We discuss the broader implications of our results in light of other works, concluding that MOND must be substantially modified on small scales to account for local WBs.
#### Nucleosynthetic Analysis of Long-Term Three-Dimensional Core-Collapse  Supernova Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We study in detail the ejecta conditions and theoretical nucleosynthetic results for 17 three-dimensional core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations done by F{\sc ornax}. We find that multi-dimensional effects introduce many complexities into ejecta conditions. We see stochastic electron fraction evolution, complex peak temperature distributions and histories, and long-tail distributions of the time spent within nucleosynthetic temperature ranges. These all lead to substantial variation in CCSN nucleosynthetic yields and differences with 1D results. We discuss the production of lighter $\alpha$-nuclei, radioactive isotopes, heavier elements, and a few isotopes of special interest. Comparing pre-CCSN and CCSN contributions, we find that a significant fraction of elements between roughly Si and Ge are generically produced in CCSNe. We find that $^{44}$Ti exhibits an extended production timescale compared to $^{56}$Ni, which may explain its different distribution and higher than previously predicted abundances in supernova remnants such as Cas A and SN1987A. We also discuss the morphology of the ejected elements. This study highlights the high-level diversity of ejecta conditions and nucleosynthetic results in 3D CCSN simulations and emphasizes the need for additional long-term 3D simulations to properly address such complexities.
#### Radiative transfer of Lyman-$α$ photons at cosmic dawn with  realistic gas physics

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic dawn 21-cm signal is enabled by Ly~$\alpha$ photons through a process called the Wouthuysen-Field effect. An accurate model of the signal in this epoch hinges on the accuracy of the computation of the Ly~$\alpha$ coupling, which requires one to calculate the specific intensity of UV radiation from sources such as the first stars. Most traditional calculations of the Ly~$\alpha$ coupling assume a delta-function scattering cross-section, as the resonant nature of the Ly~$\alpha$ scattering makes an accurate radiative transfer solution computationally expensive. Attempts to improve upon this traditional approach using numerical radiative transfer have recently emerged. However, the radiative transfer computation in these treatments suffers from assumptions such as a uniform density of intergalactic gas, zero gas temperature, and absence of gas bulk motion, or numerical approximations such as core skipping. We investigate the role played by these approximations in setting the value of the Ly~$\alpha$ coupling and the 21-cm signal at cosmic dawn. We present results of Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, without core skipping, and show that neglecting gas temperature in the radiative transfer significantly underestimates the scattering rate and hence the Ly~$\alpha$ coupling and the 21-cm signal. We also discuss the effect of these processes on the 21-cm power spectrum from the cosmic dawn. This work points the way towards higher-accuracy models to enable better inferences from future measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we use Topological Data Analysis (TDA), a mathematical approach for studying data shape, to analyse Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Applying the Mapper algorithm, we visualise the topological structure of a large FRB sample. Our findings reveal three distinct FRB populations based on their inferred source properties, and show a robust structure indicating their morphology and energy. We also identify potential non-repeating FRBs that might become repeaters based on proximity in the Mapper graph. This work showcases TDA's promise in unraveling the origin and nature of FRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to shed light on the characteristics of the broad line region (BLR) in a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy, we present an analysis of X-ray, UV, and optical spectroscopic observations of the broad emission lines in Mrk 110. For the broad-band modelling of the emission-line luminosity, we adopt the `locally optimally emitting cloud' approach, which allows us to place constraints on the gas radial and density distribution. By exploring additional environmental effects, we investigate the possible scenarios resulting in the observed spectra. We find that the photoionised gas in Mrk 110 responsible for the UV emission can fully account for the observed low-ionisation X-ray lines. The overall ionisation of the gas is lower, and one radial power-law distribution with a high integrated covering fraction $C_{\mathrm{f}} \approx 0.5$ provides an acceptable description of the emission lines spanning from X-rays to the optical band. The BLR is likely more compact than the broad-line Seyfert 1s studied so far, extending from $\sim\!10^{16}$ to $\sim\!10^{18}$ cm, and limited by the dust sublimation radius at the outer edge. Despite the large colour excess predicted by the Balmer ratio, the best fit suggests $E(B-V)\approx0.03$ for both the ionising luminosity and the BLR, indicating that extinction might be uniform over a range of viewing angles. While the adopted data-modelling technique does not allow us to place constraints on the geometry of the BLR, we show that the addition of models with a clumpy, equatorial, wind-like structure may lead to a better description of the observed spectra.
#### The omnipresent flux-dependent optical dips of the black hole transient  Swift J1357.2-0933

 - **Abstract**
 Swift J1357.2-0933 is a black hole transient of particular interest due to the optical, recurrent dips found during its first two outbursts (in 2011 and 2017), with no obvious X-ray equivalent. We present fast optical photometry during its two most recent outbursts, in 2019 and 2021. Our observations reveal that the optical dips were present in every observed outburst of the source, although they were shallower and showed longer recurrence periods in the two most recent and fainter events. We perform a global study of the dips properties in the four outbursts, and find that they do not follow a common temporal evolution. In addition, we discover a correlation with the X-ray and optical fluxes, with dips being more profound and showing shorter recurrence periods for brighter stages. This trend seems to extend even to the faintest, quiescent states of the source. Finally, we discuss these results in the context of the possible connection between optical dips and outflows found in previous works.

 - **Abstract**
 The goal of this work is to characterize the polarization effects of the VLTI and GRAVITY. This is needed to calibrate polarimetric observations with GRAVITY for instrumental effects and to understand the systematic error introduced to the astrometry due to birefringence when observing targets with a significant intrinsic polarization. By combining a model of the VLTI light path and its mirrors and dedicated experimental data, we construct a full polarization model of the VLTI UTs and the GRAVITY instrument. We first characterize all telescopes together to construct a UT calibration model for polarized targets. We then expand the model to include the differential birefringence. With this, we can constrain the systematic errors for highly polarized targets. Together with this paper, we publish a standalone Python package to calibrate the instrumental effects on polarimetric observations. This enables the community to use GRAVITY to observe targets in a polarimetric observing mode. We demonstrate the calibration model with the galactic center star IRS 16C. For this source, we can constrain the polarization degree to within 0.4 % and the polarization angle within 5 deg while being consistent with the literature. Furthermore, we show that there is no significant contrast loss, even if the science and fringe-tracker targets have significantly different polarization, and we determine that the phase error in such an observation is smaller than 1 deg, corresponding to an astrometric error of 10 {\mu}as. With this work, we enable the use of the polarimetric mode with GRAVITY/UTs and outline the steps necessary to observe and calibrate polarized targets. We demonstrate that it is possible to measure the intrinsic polarization of astrophysical sources with high precision and that polarization effects do not limit astrometric observations of polarized targets.

 - **Abstract**
 Thermal inertia estimates are available for a limited number of a few hundred objects, and the results are practically solely based on thermophysical modeling (TPM). We present a novel thermal inertia estimation method, Asteroid Thermal Inertia Analyzer (ASTERIA). The core of the ASTERIA model is the Monte Carlo approach, based on the Yarkovsky drift detection. We validate our model on asteroid Bennu plus ten well-characterized near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) for which a good estimation of the thermal inertia from the TPM exists. The tests show that the ASTERIA provides reliable results consistent with the literature values. The new method is independent from the TPM, allowing an independent verification of the results. As the Yarkovsky effect is more pronounced in small asteroids, the noteworthy advantage of the ASTERIA compared to the TPM is the ability to work with smaller asteroids for which TPM typically lacks the input data. We used the ASTERIA to estimate the thermal inertia of 38 NEAs, with 31 of them being sub-km asteroids. Twenty-nine objects in our sample are characterized as Potentially Hazardous Asteroids. On the limitation side, the ASTERIA is somewhat less accurate than the TPM. The applicability of our model is limited to NEAs, as the Yarkovsky effect is yet to be detected in main-belt asteroids. However, we can expect a significant increase in high-quality measurements of the input parameters relevant to the ASTERIA with upcoming surveys. This will surely increase the reliability of the results generated by the ASTERIA and widen the model's applicability.
#### RFSoC Gen3-Based Software-Defined Radio Characterization for the Readout  System of Low-Temperature Bolometers

 - **Abstract**
 This work reports the performance evaluation of an SDR readout system based on the latest generation (Gen3) of the AMD's Radio Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC) processing platform, which integrates a full-stack processing system and a powerful FPGA with up to 32 high-speed and high-resolution 14-bit Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) and Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). The proposed readout system uses a previously developed multi-band, double-conversion IQ RF-mixing board targeting a multiplexing factor of approximately 1,000 bolometers in a bandwidth between 4 and 8 GHz, in line with state-of-the-art microwave SQUID multiplexers ($\mu$MUX). The characterization of the system was performed in two stages, under the conditions typically imposed by the multiplexer and the cold readout circuit. First, in transmission, showing that noise and spurious levels of the generated tones are close to the values imposed by the cold readout. Second, in RF loopback, presenting noise values better than -100 dBc/Hz totally in agreement with the state-of-the-art readout systems. It was demonstrated that the RFSoC Gen3 device is a suitable enabling technology for the next generation of superconducting detector readout systems, reducing system complexity, increasing system integration, and achieving these goals without performance degradation.

 - **Abstract**
 It was pointed out previously~\cite{Kinney:2014jya} that a sufficiently negative running of the spectral index of curvature perturbations from (ordinary i.e. cold) inflation is able to prevent eternal inflation from ever occurring. Here, we reevaluate those original results, but in the context of warm inflation, in which a substantial radiation component (produced by the inflaton) exists throughout the inflationary period. We demonstrate that the same general requirements found in the context of ordinary (cold) inflation also hold true in warm inflation; indeed an even tinier amount of negative running is sufficient to prevent eternal inflation. This is particularly pertinent, as models featuring negative running are more generic in warm inflation scenarios. Finally, the condition for the existence of eternal inflation in cold inflation -- that the curvature perturbation amplitude exceed unity on superhorizon scales -- becomes more restrictive in the case of warm inflation. The curvature perturbations must be even larger, i.e. even farther out on the potential, away from the part of the potential where observables, e.g. in the Cosmic Microwave Background, are produced.
#### Baryonic Imprints on DM Halos: the concentration-mass relation and its  dependence on halo and galaxy properties

 - **Abstract**
 The halo concentration-mass relation has ubiquitous use in modeling the matter field for cosmological and astrophysical analyses, and including the imprints from galaxy formation physics is tantamount to its robust usage. Many analyses, however, probe the matter around halos selected by a given halo/galaxy property -- rather than by halo mass -- and the imprints under each selection choice can be different. We employ the CAMELS simulation suite to quantify the astrophysics and cosmology dependence of the concentration-mass relation, $c_{\rm vir}-M_{\rm vir}$, when selected on five properties: (i) velocity dispersion, (ii) formation time, (iii) halo spin, (iv) stellar mass, and (v) gas mass. We construct simulation-informed nonlinear models for all properties as a function of halo mass, redshift, and six cosmological/astrophysical parameters, with a mass range $M_{\rm vir} \in [10^{11}, 10^{14.5}] M_\odot/h$. There are many mass-dependent imprints in all halo properties, with clear connections across different properties and non-linear couplings between the parameters. Finally, we extract the $c_{\rm vir}-M_{\rm vir}$ relation for subsamples of halos that have scattered above/below the mean property-$M_{\rm vir}$ relation for a chosen property. Selections on gas mass or stellar mass have a significant impact on the astrophysics/cosmology dependence of $c_{\rm vir}$, while those on any of the other three properties have a significant (mild) impact on the cosmology (astrophysics) dependence. We show that ignoring such selection effects can lead to errors of $\approx 25\%$ in baryon imprint modelling of $c_{\rm vir}$. Our nonlinear model for all properties is made publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 The efficiency of tidal dissipation provides a zeroth-order link to a planet's physical properties. For super-Earth and sub-Neptune planets in the range $R_{\oplus}\lesssim R_p \lesssim 4 R_{\oplus}$, particularly efficient dissipation (i.e., low tidal quality factors) may signify terrestrial-like planets capable of maintaining rigid crustal features. Here we explore global constraints on planetary tidal quality factors using a population of planets in multiple-planet systems whose orbital and physical properties indicate susceptibility to capture into secular spin-orbit resonances. Planets participating in secular spin-orbit resonance can maintain large axial tilts and significantly enhanced heating from obliquity tides. When obliquity tides are sufficiently strong, planets in low-order mean-motion resonances can experience resonant repulsion (period ratio increase). The observed distribution of period ratios among transiting planet pairs may thus depend non-trivially on the underlying planetary structures. We model the action of resonant repulsion and demonstrate that the observed distribution of period ratios near the 2:1 and 3:2 commensurabilties implies $Q$ values spanning from $Q\approx 10^1-10^7$ and peaking at $Q \approx 10^6$. This range includes the expected range in which super-Earth and sub-Neptune planets dissipate ($Q \approx 10^3 - 10^4$). This work serves as a proof of concept for a method of assessing the presence of two dissipation regimes, and we estimate the number of additional multi-transiting planetary systems needed to place any bimodality in the distribution on a strong statistical footing.
#### The Potential of Water-Cherenkov Air Shower Arrays for detecting  transient sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we highlight the capacity of current and forthcoming air shower arrays utilizing water-Cherenkov stations to detect neutrino events spanning energies from $10\,$GeV to $100\,$TeV. This detection approach leverages individual stations equipped with both bottom and top photosensors, making use of features of the signal time trace and machine learning techniques. Our findings demonstrate the competitiveness of this method compared to established and future neutrino-detection experiments, including IceCube and the upcoming Hyper-Kamiokande experiment.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter haloes grow at a rate that depends on the value of the cosmological parameters $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ through the initial power spectrum and the linear growth factor. While halo abundance is routinely used to constrain these parameters, through cluster abundance studies, the halo growth rate is not. In recent work, we proposed constraining the cosmological parameters using observational estimates of the overall dynamical "age" of clusters, expressed, for instance, by their half-mass assembly redshift $z_{50}$. Here we explore the prospects for using the instantaneous growth rate, as estimated from the halo merger rate, from the average growth rate over the last dynamical time, or from the fraction of systems with recent episodes of major growth. We show that the merger rate is mainly sensitive to the amplitude of fluctuations $\sigma_8$, while the rates of recent growth provide constraints in the $\Omega_{\rm m}$-$\sigma_8$ plane that are almost orthogonal to those provided by abundance studies. Data collected for forthcoming cluster abundance studies, or studies of the galaxy merger rate in current and future galaxy surveys, may thus provide additional constraints on the cosmological parameters complementary to those already derived from halo abundance.

 - **Abstract**
 The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) is under study as a potential far-IR space mission, featuring actively cooled optics, and both imaging and spectroscopic instrumentation. To fully take advantage of the low background afforded by a cold telescope, spectroscopy with PRIMA requires detectors with a noise equivalent power (NEP) better than $1 \times 10^{-19}$ W Hz$^{-1/2}$. To meet this goal we are developing large format arrays of kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) to work across the $25-250$ micron range. Here we present the design and characterization of a single pixel prototype detector optimized for $210$ micron. The KID consist of a lens-coupled aluminum inductor-absorber connected to a niobium interdigitated capacitor to form a 2 GHz resonator. We measure the performance of this detector with optical loading in the $0.01 - 300$ aW range. At low loading the detector achieves an NEP of $9\times10^{-20}$ W Hz$^{-1/2}$ at a 10 Hz readout frequency, and the lens-absorber system achieves a good optical efficiency. An extrapolation of these measurements suggest this detector may remain photon noise limited at up to 20 fW, offering a high dynamic range for PRIMA observations of bright astronomical sources.

 Since the 1970s, astronomers have struggled with the issue of how matter can be accreted to promote black hole growth. While low-angular-momentum stars may be devoured by the black hole, they are not a sustainable source of fuel. Gas, which could potentially provide an abundant fuel source, presents another challenge due to its enormous angular momentum. While viscous torques are not significant, gas is subject to gravity torques from non-axisymmetric potentials such as bars and spirals. Primary bars can exchange angular momentum with the gas inside corotation, driving it inward spiraling until the inner Lindblad resonance is reached. An embedded nuclear bar can then take over. As the gas reaches the black hole's sphere of influence, the torque turns negative, fueling the center. Dynamical friction also accelerates the infall of gas clouds closer to the nucleus. However, due to the Eddington limit, growing a black hole from a stellar-mass seed is a slow process. The existence of very massive black holes in the early universe remains a puzzle that could potentially be solved through direct collapse of massive clouds into black holes or super-Eddington accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 While proper orbital elements are currently available for more than 1 million asteroids, taxonomical information is still lagging behind. Surveys like SDSS-MOC4 provided preliminary information for more than 100,000 objects, but many asteroids still lack even a basic taxonomy. In this study, we use Dark Energy Survey (DES) data to provide new information on asteroid physical properties. By cross-correlating the new DES database with other databases, we investigate how asteroid taxonomy is reflected in DES data. While the resolution of DES data is not sufficient to distinguish between different asteroid taxonomies within the complexes, except for V-type objects, it can provide information on whether an asteroid belongs to the C- or S-complex. Here, machine learning methods optimized through the use of genetic algorithms were used to predict the labels of more than 68,000 asteroids with no prior taxonomic information. Using a high-quality, limited set of asteroids with data on $gri$ slopes and $i-z$ colors, we detected 409 new possible V-type asteroids. Their orbital distribution is highly consistent with that of other known V-type objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Although low-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations (LFQPOs) are commonly detected in the X-ray light curves of accreting black hole X-ray binaries, their origin still remains elusive. In this study, we conduct phase-resolved spectroscopy in a broad energy band for LFQPOs in MAXI J1820+070 during its 2018 outburst, utilizing Insight-HXMT observations. By employing the Hilbert-Huang transform method, we extract the intrinsic quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) variability, and obtain the corresponding instantaneous amplitude, phase, and frequency functions for each data point. With well-defined phases, we construct QPO waveforms and phase-resolved spectra. By comparing the phase-folded waveform with that obtained from the Fourier method, we find that phase folding on the phase of the QPO fundamental frequency leads to a slight reduction in the contribution of the harmonic component. This suggests that the phase difference between QPO harmonics exhibits time variability. Phase-resolved spectral analysis reveals strong concurrent modulations of the spectral index and flux across the bright hard state. The modulation of the spectral index could potentially be explained by both the corona and jet precession models, with the latter requiring efficient acceleration within the jet. Furthermore, significant modulations in the reflection fraction are detected exclusively during the later stages of the bright hard state. These findings provide support for the geometric origin of LFQPOs and offer valuable insights into the evolution of the accretion geometry during the outburst in MAXI J1820+070.

 - **Abstract**
 Image degradation impedes our ability to extract information from astronomical observations. One factor contributing to this degradation is ``dome seeing", the reduction in image quality due to variations in the index of refraction within the observatory dome. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a novel setup-DIMSUM (Differential Image Motion Sensor Using Multisources)-which offers a simple installation and provides direct characterization of local index of refraction variations. This is achieved by measuring differential image motion using strobed imaging that effectively``freezes" the atmosphere, aligning our captured images with the timescale of thermal fluctuations, thereby giving a more accurate representation of dome seeing effects. Our apparatus has been situated within the Auxiliary Telescope of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Early results from our setup are encouraging. Not only do we observe a correlation between the characteristic differential image motion (DIM) values and local temperature fluctuations (a leading cause of variations in index of refraction), but also hint at the potential of DIM measures to characterize dome seeing with greater precision in subsequent tests. Our preliminary findings underscore the potential of DIMSUM as a powerful tool for enhancing image quality in ground-based astronomical observations. Further refinement and data collection will likely solidify its place as a useful component for managing dome seeing in major observatories like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.

 On August 25th 2013 Dana Patchick from the "Deep Sky Hunters" (DSH) amateur astronomer group discovered a diffuse nebulosity in the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mid-IR image archive that had no optical counterpart but appeared similar to many Planetary Nebulae (PNe) in WISE. As his 30th discovery he named it Pa 30 and it was added to the HASH PN database as a new PN candidate. Little did he know how important his discovery would become. 10 years later this object is the only known bound remnant of a violent double WD merger accompanied by a rare Type Iax SN, observed and recorded by the ancient Chinese and Japanese in 1181 AD. This makes Pa 30 and its central star IRAS 00500+6713 (WD J005311) the only SN Iax remnant in our Galaxy, the only known bound remnant of any SN, and based on the central star's spectrum the only Wolf-Rayet star known that neither has a massive progenitor nor is the central star of a Planetary Nebula. We cover this story and our key role in it.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a hierarchical Bayesian inference approach to estimating the structural properties and the phase space center of a globular cluster (GC) given the spatial and kinematic information of its stars based on lowered isothermal cluster models. As a first step towards more realistic modelling of GCs, we built a differentiable, accurate emulator of the lowered isothermal distribution function using interpolation. The reliable gradient information provided by the emulator allows the use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to sample large Bayesian models with hundreds of parameters, thereby enabling inference on hierarchical models. We explore the use of hierarchical Bayesian modelling to address several issues encountered in observations of GC including an unknown GC center, incomplete data, and measurement errors. Our approach not only avoids the common technique of radial binning but also incorporates the aforementioned uncertainties in a robust and statistically consistent way. Through demonstrating the reliability of our hierarchical Bayesian model on simulations, our work lays out the foundation for more realistic and complex modelling of real GC data.

 - **Abstract**
 Traditional spectral analysis methods are increasingly challenged by the exploding volumes of data produced by contemporary astronomical surveys. In response, we develop deep-Regularized Ensemble-based Multi-task Learning with Asymmetric Loss for Probabilistic Inference ($\rm{deep-REMAP}$), a novel framework that utilizes the rich synthetic spectra from the PHOENIX library and observational data from the MARVELS survey to accurately predict stellar atmospheric parameters. By harnessing advanced machine learning techniques, including multi-task learning and an innovative asymmetric loss function, $\rm{deep-REMAP}$ demonstrates superior predictive capabilities in determining effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity from observed spectra. Our results reveal the framework's effectiveness in extending to other stellar libraries and properties, paving the way for more sophisticated and automated techniques in stellar characterization.

 - **Abstract**
 The KM3NeT neutrino telescope is currently being deployed at two different sites in the Mediterranean Sea. First searches for astrophysical neutrinos have been performed using data taken with the partial detector configuration already in operation. The paper presents the results of two independent searches for neutrinos from compact binary mergers detected during the third observing run of the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave interferometers. The first search looks for a global increase in the detector counting rates that could be associated with inverse beta decay events generated by MeV-scale electron anti-neutrinos. The second one focuses on upgoing track-like events mainly induced by muon (anti-)neutrinos in the GeV--TeV energy range. Both searches yield no significant excess for the sources in the gravitational wave catalogs. For each source, upper limits on the neutrino flux and on the total energy emitted in neutrinos in the respective energy ranges have been set. Stacking analyses of binary black hole mergers and neutron star-black hole mergers have also been performed to constrain the characteristic neutrino emission from these categories.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomical data reduction is usually done with processing pipelines that consist of a series of individual processing steps that can be executed stand-alone. These processing steps are then strung together into workflows and fed with data to address a particular processing goal. In this paper, we propose a data processing system that automatically derives processing workflows for different use cases from a single specification of a cascade of processing steps. The system works by using formalized descriptions of data processing pipelines that specify the input and output of each processing step. Inputs can be existing data or the output of a previous step. Rules to select the most appropriate input data are directly attached to the description. A version of the proposed system has been implemented as the ESO Data Processing System (EDPS) in the Python language. The specification of processing cascades and data organisation rules use a restrictive set of Python classes, attributes and functions. The EDPS implementation of the proposed system was used to demonstrate that it is possible to automatically derive from a single specification of a pipeline processing cascade the workflows that the European Southern Observatory uses for quality control, archive production, and specialized science reduction. The EDPS will be used to replace all data reduction systems using different workflow specifications that are currently used at the European Southern Observatory.

 The cosmological model with an interaction between dynamical quintessence dark energy and cold dark matter is considered. Evolution of a dark energy equation of state parameter is defined by a dark energy adiabatic sound speed and a dark sector interaction parameter, which must be more physically correct model then a previously used in which such evolution was given by some fixed dependence on scale factor. The constraints on interaction parameter and other parameters of the model was obtained using a cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations and supernova SN Ia data.

 - **Abstract**
 Analyzing single-dish and VLBI radio, as well as Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray observations, we explained the three major $\gamma$-ray flares in the $\gamma$-ray light curve of FSRQ J1048+7143 with the spin-orbit precession of the dominant mass black hole in a supermassive black hole binary system. Here, we report on the detection of a fourth $\gamma$-ray flare from J1048+7143, appearing in the time interval which was predicted in our previous work. Using the updated analysis covering the time range between 2008 Aug 4 and 2023 Jun 4, we further constrain the parameters of the hypothetical supermassive binary black hole at the heart of J1048+7143 and we predict the occurrence of the fifth major $\gamma$-ray flare that would appear only if the jet will still lay close to our line sight. The fourth major $\gamma$-ray flare also shows the two-subflare structure, further strengthening our scenario in which the occurrence of the subflares is the signature of the precession of a spine-sheath jet structure that quasi-periodically interacts with a proton target, e.g. clouds in the broad-line region.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of protoplanetary disc evolution and planet formation has mainly concentrated on solar (and low) mass stars since they host the majority of the confirmed exoplanets. Nevertheless, the numerous planets found orbiting stars up to $\sim3M_\odot$ has sparked interest in understanding how they form and how their hosting discs evolve. Our goal is to improve our knowledge on the gas disc evolution around intermediate mass stars for future planet formation studies. We study the long-term evolution of protoplanetary discs affected by viscous accretion, X-ray and FUV photoevaporation from the central star around stars between $1 - 3M_\odot$ considering the effects of stellar evolution. We explore different values of the viscosity parameter and the initial mass of the disc. We find that the evolutionary pathway of disc dispersal depends on the stellar mass. Our simulations reveal four distinct evolutionary pathways for the gas disc not reported before that are a consequence of stellar evolution, and which will likely impact dust evolution and planet formation. As the stellar mass grows from 1 to $\sim2M_\odot$, the disc evolution changes from the conventional inside-out clearing to a homogeneous disc evolution scenario where both inner and outer discs, formed after photoevaporation opened a gap, vanish over a similar timescale. As the stellar mass continues to increase, reaching $\sim 3M_\odot$, we have identified a distinct pathway that we refer to as revenant disc evolution, where the inner and outer discs reconnect after the gap opened. For the largest masses, we observe outside-in disc dispersal, in which the outer disc dissipates first due to the strong FUV photoevaporation. Revenant disc evolution stands out as it is capable of extending the disc lifespan. Otherwise, the disc dispersal time scale decreases with increasing stellar mass except for low viscosity discs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of cloud-cloud collision (CCC) process in the Galactic molecular complex S235. Our new CO observations performed with the PMO-13.7m telescope reveal two molecular clouds, namely the S235-Main and the S235-ABC, with $\sim$ 4 km s$^{-1}$ velocity separation. The bridge feature, the possible colliding interface and the complementary distribution of the two clouds are significant observational signatures of cloud-cloud collision in S235. The most direct evidence of cloud-cloud collision process in S235 is that the S235-Main (in a distance of 1547$^{+44}_{-43}$ pc) and S235-ABC (1567$^{+33}_{-39}$ pc) meet at almost the same position (within 1$\sigma$ error range) at a supersonic relative speed. We identified ten $^{13}$CO clumps from PMO-13.7m observations, 22 dust cores from the archival SCUBA-2 data, and 550 YSOs from NIR-MIR data. 63$\%$ of total YSOs are clustering in seven MST groups (M1$-$M7). The tight association between the YSO groups (M1 $\&$ M7) and the bridge feature suggests that the CCC process triggers star formation there. The collisional impact subregion (the South) shows $3\sim5$ times higher CFE and SFE (average value of 12.3$\%$ and 10.6$\%$, respectively) than the non-collisional impact subregion (2.4$\%$ and 2.6$\%$, respectively), suggesting that the CCC process may have enhanced the CFE and SFE of the clouds compared to those without collision influence.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for non-Gaussian signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is crucial for understanding the physics of the early Universe. Given the possibility of non-Gaussian fluctuations in the CMB, a recent revision to the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model has been proposed, dubbed "Super-$\Lambda$CDM". This model introduces additional free parameters to account for the potential effects of a trispectrum in the primordial fluctuations. In this study, we explore the impact of the Super-$\Lambda$CDM model on current constraints on neutrino physics. In agreement with previous research, our analysis reveals that for most of the datasets, the Super-$\Lambda$CDM parameter $A_0$ significantly deviates from zero at over a $95\%$ confidence level. We then demonstrate that this signal might influence current constraints in the neutrino sector. Specifically, we find that the current constraints on neutrino masses may be relaxed by over a factor of two within the Super-$\Lambda$CDM framework, thanks to the correlation present with $A_0$. Consequently, locking $A_0=0$ might introduce a bias, leading to overly stringent constraints on the total neutrino mass.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the one-loop corrections on CMB scale perturbations induced from small scale modes in single field models which undergo a phase of ultra slow-roll inflation. There were concerns that large loop corrections are against the notion of the decoupling of scales and they are cancelled out once the boundary terms are included in Hamiltonian. We highlight that the non-linear coupling between the long and short modes and the modulation of the short mode power spectrum by the long mode are the key physical reasons behind the large loop corrections. In particular, in order for the modulation by the long mode to be significant there should be a strong scale-dependent enhancement in power spectrum of the short mode which is the hallmark of the USR inflation. We highlight the important roles played by the would-be decaying mode which were not taken into account properly in recent works claiming the loop cancellation. We confirm the original conclusion that the loop corrections are genuine and they can be dangerous for PBHs formation unless the transition to the final attractor phase is mild.

 - **Abstract**
 Using a fully Bayesian approach, Gaussian Process regression is extended to include marginalisation over the kernel choice and kernel hyperparameters. In addition, Bayesian model comparison via the evidence enables direct kernel comparison. The calculation of the joint posterior was implemented with a transdimensional sampler which simultaneously samples over the discrete kernel choice and their hyperparameters by embedding these in a higher-dimensional space, from which samples are taken using nested sampling. This method was explored on synthetic data from exoplanet transit light curve simulations. The true kernel was recovered in the low noise region while no kernel was preferred for larger noise. Furthermore, inference of the physical exoplanet hyperparameters was conducted. In the high noise region, either the bias in the posteriors was removed, the posteriors were broadened or the accuracy of the inference was increased. In addition, the uncertainty in mean function predictive distribution increased due to the uncertainty in the kernel choice. Subsequently, the method was extended to marginalisation over mean functions and noise models and applied to the inference of the present-day Hubble parameter, $H_0$, from real measurements of the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift, derived from the cosmologically model-independent cosmic chronometer and {\Lambda}CDM-dependent baryon acoustic oscillation observations. The inferred $H_0$ values from the cosmic chronometers, baryon acoustic oscillations and combined datasets are $H_0$ = 66$\pm$6 km/s/Mpc, $H_0$ = 67$\pm$10 km/s/Mpc and $H_0$ = 69$\pm$6 km/s/Mpc, respectively. The kernel posterior of the cosmic chronometers dataset prefers a non-stationary linear kernel. Finally, the datasets are shown to be not in tension with ln(R)=12.17$\pm$0.02.

 - **Abstract**
 Exploring planetary systems similar to our solar system can provide a means to explore a large range of possibly temperate climates on Earth-like worlds. Rather than run hundreds of simulations with different eccentricities at fixed obliquities, our variable-eccentricity approach provides a means to cover an incredibly large parameter space. Herein Jupiter's orbital radius is moved substantially inward in two different scenarios, causing a forcing on Earth's eccentricity. In one case, the eccentricity of Earth varies from 0 to 0.27 over ~7000 yr for three different fixed obliquities (0{\deg}, 23{\deg}, and 45{\deg}). In another case, the eccentricity varies from 0 to 0.53 over ~9400 yr in a single case with zero obliquity. In all cases, we find that the climate remains stable, but regional habitability changes through time in unique ways. At the same time, the moist greenhouse state is approached but only when at the highest eccentricities.

 - **Abstract**
 The fraction of massive stars in young stellar clusters is of importance as they are the dominant sources of both mechanical and radiative feedback, strongly influencing the thermal and dynamical state of their birth environments. It turns out that a significant fraction of massive stars escape from their parent cluster via dynamical interactions of single stars and/or multiple stellar systems. M 17 is the nearest giant H II region hosting a very young and massive cluster: NGC 6618. Our aim is to identify stars brighter than G < 21 mag that belong to NGC 6618, including the (massive) stars that may have escaped since its formation, and to determine the cluster distance and age. We identified 42 members of NGC 6618 of which eight have a spectral type of O, with a mean distance of 1675 pc and a transversal velocity dispersion of about 3 km/s , and a radial velocity dispersion of 6 km/s. Another ten O stars are associated with NGC 6618, but they cannot be classified as members due to poor astrometry or high extinction. We have also identified six O star runaways. The relative transverse velocity of these runaways ranges from 10 to 70 km/s and their kinematic age ranges from about 100 to 750 kyr. Given the already established young age of NGC 6618 (< 1 Myr), this implies that massive stars are being ejected from the cluster already directly after or during the cluster formation process. When constructing the initial mass function, one has to take into account the massive stars that have already escaped from the cluster, that is, about 30% of the O stars of the original population of NGC 6618. The trajectories of the O runaways can be traced back to the central 0.25 pc region of NGC 6618. The good agreement between the evolutionary and kinematic age of the runaways implies that the latter provides an independent way to estimate (a lower limit to) the age of the cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a theoretical model of the near-surface shear layer (NSSL) of the Sun. Convection cells deeper down are affected by the Sun's rotation, but this is not the case in a layer just below the solar surface due to the smallness of the convection cells there. Based on this idea, we show that the thermal wind balance equation (the basic equation in the theory of the meridional circulation which holds inside the convection zone) can be solved to obtain the structure of the NSSL, matching observational data remarkably well.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a first measurement of the galaxy-galaxy-CMB lensing bispectrum. The signal is detected at $26\sigma$ and $22\sigma$ significance using two samples from the unWISE galaxy catalog at mean redshifts $\bar{z}=0.6$ and $1.1$ and lensing reconstructions from Planck PR4. We employ a compressed bispectrum estimator based on the cross-correlation between the square of the galaxy overdensity field and CMB lensing reconstructions. We present a series of consistency tests to ensure the cosmological origin of our signal and rule out potential foreground contamination. We compare our results to model predictions from a halo model previously fit to only two-point spectra, finding reasonable agreement when restricting our analysis to large scales. Such measurements of the CMB lensing galaxy bispectrum will have several important cosmological applications, including constraining the uncertain higher-order bias parameters that currently limit lensing cross-correlation analyses.
