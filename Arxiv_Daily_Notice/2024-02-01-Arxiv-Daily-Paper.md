 - **Abstract**
 SDSS J1430+2303 has been argued to possess a supermassive black hole binary which is predicted to merge within a few months or three years from January 2022. We conducted follow-up optical spectroscopic observations of SDSS J1430+2303 with KOOLS-IFU on Seimei Telescope in May, June, and July 2022, and April 2023. The observed spectrum around $\mathrm{H}\mathrm{\alpha}$ shows a central broad component $\sim 10^3\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$ blueshifted from the narrow H$\mathrm{\alpha}$ line as well as the broader double-peaked component with a separation of $\sim\pm 5\times10^3\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, similar to the spectrum reported in January 2022. We investigate the variability of the complex broad $\mathrm{H}\mathrm{\alpha}$ emission line relative to the continuum over the observation period. The continuum-normalized relative flux of the central broad component shows the increasing trend from May to July 2022 which is interpreted to be caused by the decrease of the continuum as also supported by damping of the X-ray, UV, and optical light curves observed for the same period. From July 2022 to April 2023, however, the central broad component decreased significantly. For the relative flux of the broader double-peaked component, on the other hand, no significant change appears at any epoch. These results suggest that the complicated broad line profile of SDSS J1430+2303 is generated from at least two distinct regions. While the central broad component originates from a broad line region, the broader double-peaked component arises in the vicinity of the continuum source.

 - **Abstract**
 Traditionally, the pair instability (PI) mass gap is located between 50\,and 130\,$M_{\odot}$, with stellar mass black holes (BHs) expected to "pile up" towards the lower PI edge. However, this lower PI boundary is based on the assumption that the star has already lost its hydrogen (H) envelope. With the announcement of an "impossibly" heavy BH of 85\,$M_{\odot}$ as part of GW\,190521 located inside the traditional PI gap, we realised that blue supergiant (BSG) progenitors with small cores but large Hydrogen envelopes at low metallicity ($Z$) could directly collapse to heavier BHs than had hitherto been assumed. The question of whether a single star can produce such a heavy BH is important, independent of gravitational wave events. Here, we systematically investigate the masses of stars inside the traditional PI gap by way of a grid of 336 detailed MESA stellar evolution models calculated across a wide parameter space, varying stellar mass, overshooting, rotation, semi-convection, and $Z$. We evolve low $Z$ stars in the range $10^{-3} < Z / Z_{\odot} < Z_{\rm SMC}$, making no prior assumption regarding the mass of an envelope, but instead employing a wind mass loss recipe to calculate it. We compute critical Carbon-Oxygen and Helium core masses to determine our lower limit to PI physics, and we provide two equations for $M_{\text{core}}$ and $M_{\text{final}}$ that can also be of use for binary population synthesis. Assuming the H envelope falls into the BH, we confirm the maximum BH mass below PI is $M_{\text{BH}} \simeq 93.3$ $M_{\odot}$. Our grid allows us to populate the traditional PI gap, and we conclude that the distribution of BHs above the gap is not solely due to the shape of the initial mass function (IMF), but also to the same stellar interior physics (i.e. mixing) that which sets the BH maximum.

 - **Abstract**
 Circumbinary disks are found in a variety of astrophysical scenarios, spanning binary star formation to accreting supermassive black hole binaries. The interaction with a circumbinary disk can yield opposite effects on the binary orbit leading to circularization, or exciting the eccentricity, widening the orbit or shrinking it and facilitating mergers. We present a new formalism for the long-term evolution of the disk-binary interaction based on the results of recent suites of hydrodynamic simulations, which resolve the complex geometry of the gas in the vicinity of the binary and fully account for the gravitational and accretion forces. We release a python package, \texttt{spindler}, that implements our model. We show that, unless the mass reservoir feeding the disk is comparable to the mass of the binary, accretion onto the binary depletes the disk mass before inducing a significant change in orbital separation or mass ratio. This finding implies that, in most scenarios, interaction with a circumbinary disk is not an efficient mechanism to shrink the orbit of the binary. However, as long as the mass of the disk is at least a few percent of the mass of the binary, the interaction can excite the eccentricity up to an equilibrium value, and induce a statistical correlation between mass ratio and eccentricity. We consider the applicability of our model to a variety of astrophysical scenarios: during star formation, in evolved stellar binaries, triples and in supermassive black hole binaries. We discuss the theoretical and observational implications of our predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 In the late stage of terrestrial planet formation, planets are predicted to undergo pairwise collisions known as giant impacts. Here we present a high-resolution database of giant impacts for differentiated colliding bodies of iron-silicate composition, with target masses ranging from 10^-4 M_Earth up to super-Earths (5 M_Earth). We vary impactor-to-target mass ratio, core-mantle (iron-silicate) fraction, impact velocity, and impact angle. Strength in the form of friction is included in all simulations. We find that due to strength, collisions with bodies smaller than about 2*10^-3 M_Earth can result in irregular shapes, compound core structures, and captured binaries. We observe that the characteristic escaping velocity of smaller remnants (debris) is approximately half of the impact velocity, significantly faster than currently assumed in N-body simulations of planet formation. Incorporating these results in N-body planet formation studies would provide more realistic debris-debris and debris-planet interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) has the largest aperture and a 19-beam L-band receiver, making it powerful for investigating the neutral hydrogen atomic gas (HI) in the universe. We present HiFAST (https://hifast.readthedocs.io), a dedicated, modular, and self-contained calibration and imaging pipeline for processing the HI data of FAST. The pipeline consists of frequency-dependent noise diode calibration, baseline fitting, standing wave removal using an FFT-based method, flux density calibration, stray radiation correction, and gridding to produce data cubes. These modules can be combined as needed to process the data from most FAST observation modes: tracking, drift scanning, On-The-Fly mapping, and most of their variants. With HiFAST, the RMS noises of the calibrated spectra from all 19 beams were only slightly (~ 5%) higher than the theoretical expectation. The results for the extended source M33 and the point sources are consistent with the results from Arecibo. The moment maps (0,1 and 2) of M33 agree well with the results from the Arecibo Galaxy Environment Survey (AGES) with a fractional difference of less than 10%. For a common sample of 221 sources with signal-to-noise ratio S/N >10 from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey, the mean value of fractional difference in the integrated flux density, $S_{\mathrm{int}}$, between the two datasets is approximately 0.005 %, with a dispersion of 15.4%. Further checks on the integrated flux density of 23 sources with seven observations indicate that the variance in the flux density of the source with luminous objects ($S_\mathrm{int}$ $ > 2.5$ Jy km s$^{-1}$) is less than 5%. Our tests suggest that the FAST telescope, with the efficient, precise, and user-friendly pipeline HiFAST, will yield numerous significant scientific findings in the investigation of the HI in the universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-planet systems exhibit a diversity of architectures that diverge from the solar system and contribute to the topic of exoplanet demographics. Radial velocity (RV) surveys form a crucial component of exoplanet surveys, as their long observational baselines allow searches for more distant planetary orbits. This work provides a significantly revised architecture for the multi-planet system HD 134606 using both HARPS and UCLES RVs. We confirm the presence of previously reported planets b, c, and d with periods $12.0897^{+0.0019}_{-0.0018}$, $58.947^{+0.056}_{-0.054}$, and $958.7^{+6.3}_{-5.9}$ days, and masses $9.14^{+0.65}_{-0.63}$, $11.0\pm1$, and $44.5\pm2.9$ Earth masses respectively, with the planet d orbit significantly revised to over double that originally reported. We report two newly detected super-Earths, e and f, with periods $4.31943^{+0.00075}_{-0.00068}$ and $26.9^{+0.019}_{-0.017}$ days, and masses $2.31^{+0.36}_{-0.35}$ and $5.52^{+0.74}_{-0.73}$ Earth masses, respectively. In addition, we identify a linear trend in the RV time series, and the cause of this acceleration is deemed to be a newly detected sub-stellar companion at large separation. HD 134606 now displays four low mass planets in a compact region near the star, one gas giant further out in the Habitable Zone, an additional massive companion in the outer regime, and a low mass M dwarf stellar companion at large separation, making it an intriguing target for system formation/evolution studies. The location of planet d in the Habitable Zone proves to be an exciting candidate for future space-based direct imaging missions, whereas continued RV observations of this system are recommended for understanding the nature of the massive, long period companion.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos can undergo fast flavor conversions (FFCs) within extremely dense astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and neutron star mergers (NSMs). In this study, we explore FFCs in a \emph{multi-energy} neutrino gas, revealing that when the FFC growth rate significantly exceeds that of the vacuum Hamiltonian, all neutrinos (regardless of energy) share a common survival probability dictated by the energy-integrated neutrino spectrum. We then employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to predict the asymptotic outcomes of FFCs within such a multi-energy neutrino gas. These predictions are based on the first two moments of neutrino angular distributions for each energy bin, typically available in state-of-the-art CCSN and NSM simulations. Our PINNs achieve errors as low as $\lesssim6\%$ and $\lesssim 18\%$ for predicting the number of neutrinos in the electron channel and the relative absolute error in the neutrino moments, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 The vast majority of close binaries containing a compact object form through common-envelope (CE) evolution. Despite this importance, we struggle to even understand the energy budget of CE evolution. For decades, observed long-period post-CE binaries have been interpreted as evidence for additional energies to contribute during CE evolution. We have recently shown that this argument is based on simplified assumptions for all long-period post-CE binaries containing massive white dwarfs. The only remaining post-CE binary star that has been claimed to require contributions from additional energy sources to understand its formation is KOI 3278. Here we address in detail the potential evolutionary history of KOI 3278. In particular, we investigated whether extra energy sources, such as recombination energy, are indeed required to explain its existence. We used the 1D stellar evolution code MESA to carry out binary evolution simulations and searched for potential formation pathways for KOI 3278 that are able to explain its observed properties. We found that KOI 3278 can be explained if the white dwarf progenitor filled its Roche lobe during a helium shell flash. In this case, the orbital period of KOI 3278 can be reproduced if the CE binding energy is calculated taking into account gravitational energy and thermodynamic internal energy. While the CE evolution that led to the formation of KOI 3278 must have been efficient, that is, most of the available orbital energy must have been used to unbind the CE, recombination energy is not required. We conclude that currently not a single observed post-CE binary requires to assume energy sources other than gravitational and thermodynamic energy to contribute to CE evolution. KOI 3278, however, remains an intriguing post-CE binary as, unlike its siblings, understanding its existence requires highly efficient CE ejection.
#### What if PSR J1910-5959A is an observable self-lensing binary?

 - **Abstract**
 In a binary, when the orbital plane of the companion star is almost edge-on along the line-of-sight direction, this would produce an observable self-gravitational lensing effect, which would slightly increase the overall optical intensity of the binary. However, the probability of getting one observable self-lensing binary (SLB) is very low. There are only five observed SLBs so far and all of them are eclipsing binaries. In this article, we theoretically show that the neutron star-white dwarf (NS-WD) binary PSR J1910-5959A could be an observable non-eclipsing SLB. It might be the first binary showing both periodic optical amplification and Shapiro time delay of radio signals, which is useful to verify our understanding about gravitational lensing in relativistic binaries. Moreover, we show that the observed peak amplification limit of the PSR J1910-5959A can help constrain the radius of the WD, which is a crucial parameter to examine the mass-radius and temperature-radius relationship for helium WD.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the optical characterization of two-scale hierarchical phased-array antenna kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) for millimeter/submillimeter wavelengths. Our KIDs have a lumped-element architecture with parallel plate capacitors and aluminum inductors. The incoming light is received with a hierarchical phased array of slot-dipole antennas, split into 4 frequency bands (between 125 GHz and 365 GHz) with on-chip lumped-element band-pass filters, and routed to different KIDs using microstriplines. Individual pixels detect light for the 3 higher frequency bands (190-365 GHz) and the signals from four individual pixels are coherently summed to create a larger pixel detecting light for the lowest-frequency band (125-175 GHz). The spectral response of the band-pass filters was measured using Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTS), the far-field beam pattern of the phased-array antennas was obtained using an infrared source mounted on a 2-axis translating stage, and the optical efficiency of the KIDs was characterized by observing loads at 294 K and 77 K. We report on the results of these three measurements.
#### A simple method to measure numax for asteroseismology: application to  16,000 oscillating Kepler red giants

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17557
 - **Abstract**
 The importance of numax (the frequency of maximum oscillation power) for asteroseismology has been demonstrated widely in the previous decade, especially for red giants. With the large amount of photometric data from CoRoT, Kepler and TESS, several automated algorithms to retrieve numax values have been introduced. Most of these algorithms correct the granulation background in the power spectrum by fitting a model and subtracting it before measuring numax. We have developed a method that does not require fitting to the granulation background. Instead, we simply divide the power spectrum by a function of the form nu^-2, to remove the slope due to granulation background, and then smooth to measure numax. This method is fast, simple and avoids degeneracies associated with fitting. The method is able to measure oscillations in 99.9% of previously-studied Kepler red giants, with a systematic offset in numax values that depends upon the evolutionary state. On comparing the seismic radii from this work with Gaia, we see similar trends to those observed in previous studies. Additionally, our values of width of the power envelope can clearly identify the dipole mode suppressed stars as a distinct population, hence as a way to detect them. We also applied our method to stars with low (0.39--18.35 muHz) and found it works well to correctly identify the oscillations.
#### Driving factors behind multiple populations

 - **Abstract**
 Star clusters were historically considered simple stellar populations, with all stars sharing the same age and initial chemical composition. However, the presence of chemical anomalies in globular clusters (GCs), called multiple stellar populations (MPs), has challenged star formation theories in dense environments. Literature studies show that mass, metallicity, and age are likely controlling parameters for the manifestation of MPs. Identifying the limit between clusters with/without MPs in physical parameter space is crucial to reveal the driving mechanism behind their presence. In this study, we look for MP signals in Whiting 1, traditionally considered a young GC. Using the Magellan telescope, we obtained low-resolution spectra within $\rm \lambda\lambda = 3850-5500 \r{A}$ for eight giants of Whiting 1. We measured the C and N abundances from the CN and CH spectral indices. C and N abundances have variations comparable with their measurement errors ($\sim0.1$ dex), suggesting that MPs are absent from Whiting 1. Combining these findings with literature studies, we propose a limit in the metallicity vs. cluster compactness index parameter space, which relatively clearly separates star clusters with/without MPs (GCs/open clusters). This limit is physically motivated. On a larger scale, the galactic environment determines cluster compactness and metallicity, leading to metal-rich, diffuse, old clusters formed ex situ. Our proposed limit also impacts our understanding of the formation of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy: star clusters formed after the first starburst (age$\lesssim 8-10$ Gyr). These clusters are simple stellar populations because the enriched galactic environment is no longer suitable for MP formation.
#### Mechanical strength distribution in Geminid meteoroids derived via  fireball modeling

 - **Abstract**
 Geminids are the most active annual meteor shower observed on Earth. Their parent is an active asteroid, (3200) Phaethon, which is a target of the planned DESTINY+ mission of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). The exact physical nature of (3200) Phaethon and Geminids is still debated. This paper is devoted to fragmentation modeling of bright Geminid fireballs, which should reveal information about the structure of centimeter-sized Geminid meteoroids. These fireballs were observed by the European Fireball Network (EN) over the past few years. We aim to describe their disintegration cascade in the atmosphere and their mechanical properties, and to derive their precise initial masses and velocities. We used a semi-empirical fragmentation model that employs an automatic procedure based on parallel genetic algorithms to determine the aerodynamic pressures at which a meteoroid and its parts fragment. This serves as a proxy for the mechanical strength of the body and its subsequent fragments. It enabled us to derive the minimum, median, and maximum mechanical strength and the strength distribution inside the meteoroid and reveal its internal structure. We find that the Geminids begin to crumble at pressures 1--100 kPa, with the strongest parts reaching pressures of between 0.4 and 1.55 MPa before fragmenting. Knowing the spectral type of (3200) Phaethon (a B-type asteroid, part of the C complex), we conclude that the Geminids are made of compact and coherent carbonaceous material. We also find that the minimum aerodynamic pressure that causes the fragmentation of Geminids increases with increasing entry mass of Geminids. In contrast, the median aerodynamic pressure decreases as their entry mass increases. The spectra of all the observed Geminid fireballs show normal content and little variation in terms of sodium.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of live $^{60}$Fe nuclei (lifetime of 3.8~Myr) in cosmic rays detected by the ACE/CRIS instrument suggests a nearby nucleosynthesis source. $^{60}$Fe is primarily produced in core-collapse supernovae, and we aim to clarify whether the detected $^{60}$Fe nuclei can be associated with a particular local supernova. We consider 25 OB associations and sub-groups located within 1 kpc of the solar system based on recent $Gaia$ census. A model is developed that combines stellar population synthesis within these OB associations, cosmic-ray acceleration within associated superbubbles, and cosmic-ray transport to the solar system. The most critical model parameter impacting $^{60}$Fe cosmic-ray production is the explodability criterion, which determines if a massive star ends its life as a supernova. Our study points to the Sco-Cen OB association as the most probable origin of the observed $^{60}$Fe nuclei, particularly suggesting they were accelerated in the Sco-Cen superbubble by a young supernova aged $\leq500$ kyr with a progenitor mass of approximately $13-20~M_\odot$. A less likely source is the supernova at the origin of the Geminga pulsar 342 kyr ago, if the progenitor originated in the Orion OB1 association. The contribution of local OB associations to the cosmic-ray density of stable $^{56}$Fe is estimated to be around 20\%, with some sensitivity to cosmic ray acceleration efficiency and diffusion coefficient. These findings shed light on the origins of cosmic-ray nuclei, connecting them to nucleosynthesis events within our local cosmic neighborhood.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars are evolved, subluminous, helium-burning stars, most likely formed when red-giant stars lose their hydrogen envelope via interactions with close companions. They play an important role in our understanding of binary evolution, stellar atmospheres, and interiors. Within the sdB population, only a small fraction are known to exhibit pulsations. Pulsating sdBs have typically been discovered serendipitously in various photometric surveys, lacking specific selection criteria for the sample. Consequently, while individual properties of these stars are well-known, a comprehensive understanding of the entire population and many related questions remain unanswered. The introduction of Gaia has presented an exceptional chance to create an unbiased sample by employing precise criteria and ensuring a high degree of completeness. The progression of high-precision and high-duty cycle photometric monitoring facilitated by space missions such as Kepler/K2 and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has yielded an unparalleled wealth of data for pulsating sdBs. In this work, we created a dataset of confirmed pulsating sdB stars by combining information from various ground- and space-based photometric surveys. Utilizing this dataset, we present a thorough approach to search for pulsating sdB stars based on the current Gaia DR3 sample. Using TESS photometry, we discovered 61 new pulsating sdB stars and 20 variable sdBs whose source of variability remains to be determined through future spectroscopic follow-up observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The emergence of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations dedicated to positioning applications holds the promise of improving the capabilities of existing Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). However, the absence of operational systems necessitates a qualitative assessment of potential improvements through simulation. This paper introduces a methodology to convert Two Line Element (TLE) orbital parameters, abundantly available for LEO constellations for communication and Earth Observation, into the widely used RINEX 4 format employed by GNSS. The primary goal is to establish a comprehensive database of LEO constellation orbits directly compatible with the orbit propagation algorithms utilized in GNSS systems like the Global Positioning System (GPS). This approach enables seamless integration into simulation tools with minimal adjustments. While TLE parameters are optimized for the SGP4 propagation model and cautioned against use in classical Kepler orbit propagation scenarios requiring precision, the obtained discrepancies, within a few tens of kilometers, suggest that these representations are realistic for simulation purposes, as demonstrated with the Spire LEMUR LEO constellation. As a practical application, the paper conducts a visibility analysis using the Starlink constellation. Results affirm expectations, showcasing that the combination of GNSS with a LEO mega-constellation significantly enhances satellite coverage and reduces Dilution of Precision. This work contributes to the ongoing discourse on the potential benefits and practicality of integrating emerging LEO constellations with established GNSS systems, offering insights into improved navigation and timing capabilities through simulation-based assessments.

 - **Abstract**
 The Venus thermal radiation spectrum exhibits the signature of $CO_2$ absorption bands. By means of inversion techniques, those bands enable the retrieval of atmospheric temperature profiles. We have analyzed VIRTIS-M-IR night-side data obtaining high-resolution thermal maps of Venus south polar region between 55 and 85 km altitudes for three dynamical configurations of the vortex. The cold collar is clearly distinguishable at $\sim 62$ km altitude level, and it is more than 15 K colder than the pole on average. The South Polar Vortex appears as a vertically extended hot region close to the pole and squeezed by the cold collar between altitudes 55 and 67 km but spreading equatorward at about 74 km. Both the instantaneous temperature maps and their zonal averages show that the top altitude limit of the thermal signature of the vortex is at $\sim 80$ km altitude, at least on the night-side of the planet. The upper part of the atmosphere (67 - 85 km) is more homogeneous and has long-scale horizontal temperature differences of about 25 K over horizontal distances of $\sim 2,000$ km. The lower part (55 - 67 km) shows more fine-scale structure, creating the vortex' morphology, with thermal differences of up to about 50 K over $\sim 500$ km horizontal distances. We also study the vertical stability of different atmospheric layers within the 55 - 85 km altitude range for the three vortex configurations. It is always positive, but the cold collar is the most vertically stable structure at polar latitudes, while the vortex and sub-polar latitudes show lower stability values. Furthermore, the hot filaments present within the vortex exhibit lower stability values than their surroundings. The layer between 62 and 67 km resulted to be the most stable. These results are in good agreement with conclusions from previous radio occultation analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 HII region heavy-element abundances throughout the Galactic disk provide important constraints to theories of the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. In LTE, radio recombination line (RRL) and free-free continuum emission are accurate extinction-free tracers of the HII region electron temperature. Since metals act as coolants in HII regions via the emission of collisionally excited lines, the electron temperature is a proxy for metallicity. Shaver et al. found a linear relationship between metallicity and electron temperature with little scatter. Here, we use CLOUDY HII region simulations to (1) investigate the accuracy of using RRLs to measure the electron temperature; and (2) explore the metallicity-electron temperature relationship. We model 135 HII regions with different ionizing radiation fields, densities, and metallicities. We find that electron temperatures derived under the assumption of LTE are about 20% systematically higher due to non-LTE effects, but overall LTE is a good assumption for cm-wavelength RRLs. Our CLOUDY simulations are consistent with the Shaver et al. metallicity-electron temperature relationship but there is significant scatter since earlier spectral types or higher electron densities yield higher electron temperatures. Using RRLs to derive electron temperatures assuming LTE yields errors in the predicted metallicity as large as 10%. We derive correction factors for Log(O/H) + 12 in each CLOUDY simulation. For lower metallicities the correction factor depends primarily on the spectral-type of the ionizing star and range from 0.95 to 1.10, whereas for higher metallicities the correction factor depends on the density and is between 0.97 and 1.05.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a search for Planet Nine using the second data release of the Pan-STARRS1survey. We rule out the existence of a Planet Nine with the characteristics of that predicted in Brown & Batygin (2021) to a 50% completion depth of $V=21.5$. This survey, along with previous analyses of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Dark EnergySurvey (DES) data, rules out 78% of the Brown \& Batygin parameter space. Much of the remaining parameter space is at $V>21$ in regions near and in the area where the northern galactic plane crosses the ecliptic.
#### The detection prospect of the Counter Jet radiation in the Late  Afterglow of GRB 170817A

 - **Abstract**
 The central engine of a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) is widely believed to launch a pair of oppositely moving jets, i.e. the forward jet moving towards us and the counter jet regressing away. The forward jet generates the radiation typically observed in GRBs, while the counter jet has not been detected yet due to its dimness. GRB 170817A, a short burst associated with a binary neutron star merger event, is a nearby event ($z=0.0097$) with an off-axis structured energetic forward jet and hence probably the most suitable target for searching the counter jet radiation. Assuming the same properties for the forward and counter jet components as well as the shock parameters, the fit to the multi-wavelength afterglow emission of GRB 170817A suggests a peak time $\sim {\rm quite~a~few}\times 10^{3}$ day of the counter jet radiation, but the detection prospect of this new component is not promising. Anyhow, if the shock parameters ($\epsilon_{\rm e}$ and $\epsilon_{\rm B}$) of the counter jet component are (a few times) higher than that of the forward shock, as allowed by the current data and found in previous two-component jet modeling, the counter jet afterglow emission will be enhanced and hence may be detected. A few hour exposure by JWST in F356W band will stringently test such a scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce GODMAX (Gas thermODynamics and Matter distribution using jAX), a novel code designed to calculate correlations between the cosmological matter distribution and various gas thermodynamic quantities. Utilizing the extensive ANTILLES suite of 200 hydrodynamical simulations with a diverse range of baryonic feedback strengths, we jointly fit the 3D profiles of total matter distribution, electron density, and electron pressure across various halo masses and redshifts. By accommodating significant variations in gas profiles expected due to baryonic feedback, solving exact hydrostatic equilibrium equation and offering flexible modeling of non-thermal pressure support, GODMAX has the capability to jointly fit all these profiles within the measurement uncertainties. This advancement enables, for the first time, robust joint analyses of multiple cosmic probes, including the kinetic and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, weak lensing, and X-ray observations. Furthermore, the model accurately captures correlations between the total matter power suppression due to baryonic feedback and local average thermodynamic quantities, such as the baryon fraction and integrated tSZ effect, in high-mass halos, aligning with observations from hydrodynamical simulations. Looking ahead, we forecast the expected constraints on cosmological and baryonic parameters from upcoming weak lensing catalogs from the LSST and tSZ maps from the Simons Observatory. This analysis underscores the importance of cross-correlations between weak lensing and tSZ in enhancing parameter constraints by resolving major systematic uncertainties due to baryonic physics. The GODMAX code leverages the JAX library, resulting in a fully differentiable halo model with native GPU compilation support.
#### Strong Bow Shocks: Turbulence and An Exact Self-Similar Asymptotic

 - **Abstract**
 We show that strong bow shocks are turbulent and non-universal near the head, but asymptote to a universal steady, self-similar, and analytically solvable flow in the downstream. The turbulence is essentially 3D, and has been confirmed by a 3D simulation. The asymptotic behavior is confirmed with high resolution 2D and 3D simulations of a cold uniform wind encountering both a solid spherical obstacle and stellar wind. This solution is relevant in the context of: (i) probing the kinematic properties of observed high-velocity compact bodies -- e.g., runaway stars and/or supernova ejecta blobs -- flying through the interstellar medium; and (ii) constraining stellar bow shock luminosities invoked by some quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) models.
