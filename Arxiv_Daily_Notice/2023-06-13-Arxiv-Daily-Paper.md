#### The Disturbed and Globular Cluster-Rich Ultra-diffuse Galaxy UGC  9050-Dw1

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) UGC 9050-Dw1, which was selected because of its disturbed morphology as part of a larger sample of UDGs that display evidence for significant interactions. We use the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys to identify globular clusters (GCs) associated with UGC 9050-Dw1, and the Jansky Very Large Array to measure its $\mathrm{H}\mathrm{I}$ content. UGC 9050-Dw1, a neighbor to the low surface brightness spiral UGC 9050, exhibits a unique UV bright central ``clump'' with clearly associated $\mathrm{H}{\mathrm{I}}$ gas and an extended stellar tidal plume to the north. We identify $52^{+4}_{-6}$ GCs, implying a specific frequency $S_\mathrm{N} = 122_{-24}^{+30}$, one of the highest reported for a UDG of this luminosity. Additionally, $\sim 20\%$ of the total light of the galaxy is contributed by GCs. Nearly uniform GC colors suggest they were formed during a single intense episode of star formation. We propose that UGC 9050-Dw1 formed via a rare dwarf merger event where induced, clumpy star formation led to its current observed properties.
#### Revealing the Chemical Structure of the Magellanic Clouds with APOGEE.  I. Calculating Individual Stellar Ages of RGB Stars in the Large Magellanic  Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar ages are critical for understanding the temporal evolution of a galaxy. We calculate the ages of over 6000 red giant branch stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) observed with SDSS-IV / APOGEE-S. Ages are derived using multi-band photometry, spectroscopic parameters (T$_\text{eff}$, $\log{g}$, [Fe/H], and [$\alpha$/Fe]) and stellar isochrones and the assumption that the stars lie in a thin inclined plane to get accurate distances. The isochrone age and extinction are varied until a best match is found for the observed photometry. We perform validation using the APOKASC sample, which has asteroseismic masses and accurate ages, and find that our uncertainties are $\sim$20% and range from $\sim$1$-$3 Gyr for the calculated age values. Here we present the LMC age map as well as the age-radius relation and an accurate age-metallicity relation (AMR). The age map and age-radius relation reveal that recent star formation in the galaxy was more centrally located and that there is a slight dichotomy between the north and south with the northern fields being slightly younger. The northern fields that cover a known spiral arm have median ages of $\gtrsim$ 2 Gyr, which is the time when an interaction with the SMC is suggested to have happened. The AMR is mostly flat especially for older ages although recently (about 2.0-2.5 Gyr ago) there is an increase in the median [Fe/H]. Based on the time frame, this might also be attributed to the close interaction between the LMC and SMC.
#### A tera-electronvolt afterglow from a narrow jet in an extremely bright  gamma-ray burst 221009A

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06372
 - **Abstract**
 Some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have an afterglow in the tera-electronvolt (TeV) band, but the early onset of this afterglow has not been observed. We report observations with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory of the bright GRB 221009A, which serendipitously occurred within the instrument field of view. More than 64,000 photons (above 0.2~TeV) were detected within the first 3000 seconds. The TeV photon flux began several minutes after the GRB trigger, then rose to a flux peak about 10 seconds later. This was followed by a decay phase, which became more rapid at $\sim 650\,{\rm s}$ after the peak. The emission can be explained with a relativistic jet model with half-opening angle $\sim 0.8^\circ$, consistent with the core of a structured jet. This interpretation could explain the high isotropic energy of this GRB.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. It is almost banal to say that the interstellar medium (ISM) is structurally and thermodynamically complex. But the variety of the governing processes, including stellar feedback, renders the investigation challenging. High latitude molecular clouds (HLMCs) with no evidence of internal star formation, such as MBM 40, are excellent sites for studying the chemistry and dynamic evolution of the cold neutral ISM. Aims. We used this high latitude cloud as an exemplar for the dynamical and chemical processes in the diffuse interstellar medium. Methods. We analyzed new and archival $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, CH, HCO$^+$, CS, H$_2$CO, HCN data from Five College Radio Observatory (FCRAO), Onsala Space Observatory (OSO), Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) and W. Gordon telescope (Arecibo) combined with the Galactic Arecibo L-band Feed Array HI (GALFA-HI) HI 21 cm data set, to study the chemistry, thermal state, and dynamics of MBM 40. A new dynamical analytical approach was adopted by considering each line profile as a line of sight Probability Distribution Function (PDF) of the turbulence weighted by gas emissivity. Results. The atomic and molecular gas are smoothly distributed in space and velocity. No steep transition is seen between circumcloud atomic and cloud molecular gas in either radial velocity or structure. We proposed a topology of the cloud from the molecular tracers, a contorted filamentary structure that is shaped by a broad embedding shear flow in the neutral atomic gas. Comparative examination of different molecular tracers shows that $^{13}$CO, H$_2$CO and CS arise from only denser molecular cores, where $^{12}$CO, CH and HCO$^+$ traces diffuse gas with broader range of dynamics.
#### Aerosol parameters for night sky brightness modelling estimated from  daytime sky images

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric turbidity is one of the key factors influencing the propagation of artificial light into the environment during cloudless nights. High aerosol loading can reduce the visibility of astronomical objects, and thus information on atmospheric pollution is critical for the prediction of the night sky brightness (NSB) distribution. In particular, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and asymmetry parameter (g) are among the most important aerosol properties influencing the NSB amplitudes. However, these two parameters are rarely available at astronomical sites. Here, we develop a method for AOD and g retrievals from clear-sky radiometry carried out around sunset or sunrise, shortly before or after night-time observation is intended. The method allows for reducing the number of unknowns needed in the processing and interpretation of night sky radiances, and thus provides an efficient tool for gathering input data to present skyglow simulators. The practice of collecting information about aerosols in this way could become a routine part of astronomical observations, much like observing standard stars to obtain extinction coefficients. If the procedure were conducted around sunset and the data were quickly reduced, it could offer an on-the-spot estimate of the NSB for the night ahead. The error analysis is performed using the theoretical model, while taking into account experimental errors of radiance readings. The capability of the method is demonstrated in a field experiment conducted under cloudless conditions.
#### On the origin of the anomalous gas, non-declining rotation curve and  disc asymmetries in NGC253

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-wavelength (from far ultraviolet to HI emission) study of star formation feedback on the kinematics of the interstellar medium in the Sculptor Galaxy, NGC253. Its three well-known features (a disrupted stellar disc, a previously reported delining rotation curve, and anomalous HI gas) are studied in a common context of disc asymmetries. About 170 h of on-source ATCA observations are collected and reduced into two versions of \HI\ data cubes of different angular resolution (30'' / 2') and HI column density sensitivity (7.4 $\times$ $10^{19}$cm$^{-2}$ / 4$\times$ $10^{18}$cm$^{-2}$). We separate the anomalous gas from the disc using a custom-made line profile fitting toolkit called FMG. Two star formation tracers (H$\alpha$, FUV emission) are carefully processed and studied. We find that at $R > 7.5~\mathrm{kpc}$ the star formation activity is strongly lopsided (SFR$_{NE}$ >SFR$_{SW}$), and investigate several other properties (H$\alpha$/FUV, dust temperature, stellar age, and disc stability parameters). We also find that the declining nature of the rotation curve perceived by previous studies is not intrinsic but a combined effect of kinematical asymmetries at $R = 7.5$--$16~\mathrm{kpc}$. This is likely the consequence of star formation triggered outflow. The mass distribution and the timescale of the anomalous gas also imply that it originates from gas outflow, which is perhaps caused by galaxy-galaxy interaction considering the crowded environment of NGC253.
#### A CO Funnel in the Galactic Centre: Molecular Counterpart of the  Northern Galactic Chimney?
 - **Authors:** V. S. Veena, D. Riquelme, W.-J. Kim, K. M. Menten, P. Schilke, M. C. Sormani, W. E. Banda-Barragan, F. Wyrowski, G. A. Fuller, A. Cheema

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a velocity coherent, funnel shaped ^13CO emission feature in the Galactic centre (GC) using data from the SEDIGISM survey. The molecular cloud appears as a low velocity structure (V_LSR=[-3.5, +3.5] km/s) with an angular extent of 0.95{\deg} x 1{\deg}, extending toward positive Galactic latitudes. The structure is offset from Sgr A* toward negative Galactic longitudes and spatially and morphologically correlates well with the northern lobe of the 430 pc radio bubble, believed to be the radio counterpart of the multiwavelength GC chimney. Spectral line observations in the frequency range of 85-116 GHz have been carried out using the IRAM 30 metre telescope toward 12 positions along the funnel-shaped emission. We examine the ^12C/^13C isotopic ratios using various molecules and their isotopologues. The mean ^12C/^13C isotope ratio (30.6+-2.9) is consistent with the structure located within inner 3 kpc of the Galaxy and possibly in the GC. The velocity of the molecular funnel is consistent with previous radio recombination line measurements of the northern lobe of radio bubble. Our multiwavelength analysis suggests that the funnel shaped structure extending over 100 pc above the Galactic plane is the molecular counterpart of the northern GC chimney.
#### On the occurrence of stellar fission in binary-driven hypernovae

 - **Abstract**
 The binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) model address long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) associated with type Ic supernovae (SNe) through a series of physical episodes that occur in a binary composed of a carbon-oxygen (CO) star (of mass about 10 solar mass) and a neutron star (NS) companion (of mass about 2 solar mass) in a compact orbit. The SN explosion of the CO star triggers sequence of seven events. The BdHN model has followed the traditional picture of the SN from the CO iron's core collapse. However, the lack of a solution to the problem of producing successful SNe leaves room for alternative scenarios. We here show that tidal synchronization of the CO-NS binary can lead the CO star to critical conditions for fission, hence splitting into two stellar remnants, e.g., about 8.5 solar mass + 1.5 solar mass. We give specific examples of the properties of the products for various orbital periods relevant to BdHNe. The astrophysical consequences of this scenario are outlined.
#### Searching for Radio Outflows from M31* with VLBI Observations

 - **Abstract**
 As one of the nearest and most dormant supermassive black holes (SMBHs), M31* provides a rare but promising opportunity for studying the physics of black hole accretion and feedback at the quiescent state. Previous Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations with an arcsec resolution have detected M31* as a compact radio source over centimeter wavelengths, but the steep radio spectrum suggests optically-thin synchrotron radiation from an outflow driven by a hot accretion flow onto the SMBH. Aiming to probe the putative radio outflow, we have conducted milli-arcsec-resolution very long baseline interferometric (VLBI) observations of M31* in 2016, primarily at 5 GHz and combining the Very Long Baseline Array, Tianma-65m and Shanghai-25m Radio Telescopes. Despite the unprecedented simultaneous resolution and sensitivity achieved, no significant ($\gtrsim 3\sigma$) signal is detected at the putative position of M31* given an RMS level of $\rm 5.9~\mu Jy\ beam^{-1}$, thus ruling out a point-like source with a peak flux density comparable to that ($\sim30~\mu Jy\ beam^{-1}$) measured by the VLA observations taken in 2012. We disfavor the possibility that M31* has substantially faded since 2012, in view that a 2017 VLA observation successfully detected M31* at a historically-high peak flux density ($\sim75~\mu Jy\ beam^{-1}$ at 6 GHz). Instead, the non-detection of the VLBI observations is best interpreted as the arcsec-scale core being resolved out at the milli-arcsec-scale, suggesting an intrinsic size of M31* at 5 GHz larger than $\sim300$ times the Schwarzschild radius. Such extended radio emission may originate from a hot wind driven by the weakly accreting SMBH.
