 - **Abstract**
 The choice of the launch vehicle is an important consideration during the preliminary planning of interplanetary missions. The launch vehicle must be highly reliable, capable of imparting sufficient energy to the spacecraft to inject it on to an Earth-escape trajectory, and must fit within the cost constraints of the mission. Over the recent past, the most commonly used launchers for interplanetary missions include the Atlas V401, Atlas V551, Delta IVH, and Falcon Heavy expendable version. The NASA Launch Vehicle Performance website maintains a tool to help mission planners evaluate various launch vehicles during mission studies. However, there is no comprehensive dataset which can be used to quickly compare the launch performance and launch cost of various options. The present study compiles a dataset of the high energy performance of existing and planned launchers from open-source data and performs a quantitative comparison of the launch performance and the launch cost per kg. The Falcon Heavy expendable offers the lowest cost-per-kg for high-energy launches, with only $0.075M per kg. The Vulcan Centaur offers comparable performance to the Falcon Heavy. The results indicate Falcon Heavy Expendable and the Vulcan Centaur will be the likely choice for several future missions.
#### The Not-So Dramatic Effect of Advective Flows on Gas Accretion

 - **Abstract**
 Super-Earths and mini-Neptunes are the most common types of exoplanets discovered, yet the physical scenarios behind their formation are still debated. Standard core accretion models in gas-rich environment find that typical mini-Neptune mass planets would blow up into Jupiters before the underlying disk gas dissipates away. The injection of entropy from the protoplanetary disk into forming gaseous envelopes has recently been put forward as a mechanism to delay this runaway accretion, specifically at short orbital distances. Here, we reevaluate this line of reasoning by incorporating recycling flows of gas into a numerical one-dimensional thermodynamic model with more realistic equation of state and opacities and the thermal state of the advective flow. At 0.1 AU, unless these advective flows can penetrate below $\sim$0.2 of the planet's gravitational sphere of influence, the gas-to-core mass ratio (GCR) stays above $\sim$10% before the nebular disk dissipates which is still too large to explain the measured properties of mini-Neptunes, necessitating other gas-limiting processes such as late-time core assembly. The effect of entropy advection on gas accretion weakens even further at wider orbital separations. We present an updated scaling relation between GCR and the penetration depth of the advective flows which varies non-trivially with orbital distances, core masses and dusty vs.~dust-free opacity. We further demonstrate how measurements of planet mass distribution beyond $\sim$1 AU can be used to disambiguate between different formation conditions of gas-poor planets.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of planetary systems beyond our solar system has posed challenges to established theories of planetary formation. Planetary orbits display a variety of architectures not predicted by first principles, and free-floating planets appear ubiquitous. The recent discovery of candidate Jupiter Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) further expanded this enigma. Here, by means of high-accuracy, direct $N$-body simulations, we evaluate the possibility that JuMBOs may form as a result of ejection after a close stellar flyby. We consider a system of two Jupiter-like planets moving in circular orbits with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$ at distances $a_1$ and $a_2$ around a Sun-like star. The interloper is another Sun-like star approaching with asymptotic velocity $v_\infty$. We find that JuMBOs can indeed be formed upon ejection if the two planets are nearly aligned as the interloper reaches the closest approach. The ratio of the cross section of JuMBOs production to that of single ejected free-floating planets can approach $\sim 20\%$ for $v_\infty/v_2 \sim 0.1 - 0.2$ and $a_1/a_2\sim 0.75-0.8$. JuMBOs formed via this channel are expected to have an average semi-major axis comparable to $\Delta a = (a_2-a_1)$ and high eccentricity, with a distinctive superthermal distribution which can help to observationally identify this formation channel and distinguish it from primordial formation. If the ejection channel is confirmed for these or future JWST observations, these JuMBOs will directly inform us of the conditions where these giant planets formed in protoplanetary disks, putting stringent constraints on the giant planet formation theory.
#### Little Ado about Everything: $η$CDM, a Cosmological Model with  Fluctuation-driven Acceleration at Late Times

 - **Abstract**
 [abridged] We propose a model of the Universe (dubbed $\eta$CDM) featuring a stochastic evolution of the cosmological quantities, that is meant to render small deviations from homogeneity/isotropy on scales of $30-50\, h^{-1}$ Mpc at late cosmic times, associated to the emergence of the cosmic web. Specifically, we prescribe that the behavior of the matter/radiation energy densities in different patches of the Universe with such a size can be effectively described by a stochastic version of the mass-energy evolution equation. The latter includes an appropriate noise term that statistically accounts for local fluctuations due to inhomogeneities, anisotropic stresses and matter flows. The evolution of the different patches as a function of cosmic time is rendered via the diverse realizations of the noise term; meanwhile, at any given cosmic time, sampling the ensemble of patches will originate a nontrivial spatial distribution of the cosmological quantities. The overall behavior of the Universe will be obtained by averaging over the patch ensemble. We assume a physically reasonable parameterization of the noise term, gauging it against a wealth of cosmological datasets. We find that, with respect to standard $\Lambda$CDM, the ensemble-averaged cosmic dynamics in the $\eta$CDM model is substantially altered in three main respects: (i) an accelerated expansion is enforced at late cosmic times without the need for any additional exotic component (e.g., dark energy); (ii) the spatial curvature can stay small even in a low-density Universe; (iii) matter can acquire an effective negative pressure at late times. We provide predictions for the variance of the cosmological quantities among different patches of the Universe at late cosmic times. Finally, we show that in $\eta$CDM the Hubble-tension is solved, and the cosmic coincidence problem is relieved without invoking the anthropic principle.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of planets orbiting at less than 1 au from their host star and less massive than Saturn in various exoplanetary systems revolutionized our theories of planetary formation. The fundamental question is whether these close-in low-mass planets could have formed in the inner disk interior to 1 au, or whether they formed further out in the planet-forming disk and migrated inward. Exploring the role of additional giant planets in these systems may help us to pinpoint their global formation and evolution. We searched for additional substellar companions by using direct imaging in systems known to host close-in small planets. The use of direct imaging complemented by radial velocity and astrometric detection limits enabled us to explore the giant planet and brown dwarf demographics around these hosts to investigate the potential connection between both populations. We carried out a direct imaging survey with VLT/SPHERE to look for outer giant planets and brown dwarf companions in 27 systems hosting close-in low-mass planets discovered by radial velocity. Our sample is composed of very nearby (<20pc) planetary systems, orbiting G-, K-, and M-type mature (0.5-10Gyr) stellar hosts. We performed homogeneous direct imaging data reduction and analysis to search for and characterize point sources, and derived robust statistical detection limits. Of 337 point-source detections, we do not find any new bound companions. We recovered the emblematic very cool T-type brown dwarf GJ229B. Our typical sensitivities in direct imaging range from 5 to 30 MJup beyond 2 au. The non-detection of massive companions is consistent with predictions based on models of planet formation by core accretion. Our pilot study opens the way to a multi-technique approach for the exploration of very nearby exoplanetary systems with future ground-based and space observatories.
#### NEATH II: N$_2$H$^+$ as a tracer of imminent star formation in quiescent  high-density gas

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation activity in molecular clouds is often found to be correlated with the amount of material above a column density threshold of $\sim 10^{22} \, {\rm cm^{-2}}$. Attempts to connect this column density threshold to a ${\it volume}$ density above which star formation can occur are limited by the fact that the volume density of gas is difficult to reliably measure from observations. We post-process hydrodynamical simulations of molecular clouds with a time-dependent chemical network, and investigate the connection between commonly-observed molecular species and star formation activity. We find that many molecules widely assumed to specifically trace the dense, star-forming component of molecular clouds (e.g. HCN, HCO$^+$, CS) actually also exist in substantial quantities in material only transiently enhanced in density, which will eventually return to a more diffuse state without forming any stars. By contrast, N$_2$H$^+$ only exists in detectable quantities above a volume density of $10^4 \, {\rm cm^{-3}}$, the point at which CO, which reacts destructively with N$_2$H$^+$, begins to deplete out of the gas phase onto grain surfaces. This density threshold for detectable quantities of N$_2$H$^+$ corresponds very closely to the volume density at which gas becomes irreversibly gravitationally bound in the simulations: the material traced by N$_2$H$^+$ never reverts to lower densities, and quiescent regions of molecular clouds with visible N$_2$H$^+$ emission are destined to eventually form stars. The N$_2$H$^+$ line intensity is likely to directly correlate with the star formation rate averaged over timescales of around a Myr.

 - **Abstract**
 Fundamental constants are crucial for comprehending physical mechanisms, but their measurements contain uncertainties due to experimental limitations. We investigate the impact of system temperature on these uncertainties using nearby white dwarfs observed in the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) survey. Using the structures of these white dwarfs, we show that the variation in system temperature can affect the accuracy of measurements for fundamental parameters such as the fine-structure constant and the proton-to-electron mass ratio. This exploration emphasizes the importance of considering the energy of a system while putting bounds on the values of fundamental constants.

 - **Abstract**
 The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S) Collaboration reported the discovery of a novel radiation component from the Vela pulsar by their Cherenkov telescopes. It is of great importance that gamma rays with energies of at least 20~TeV are recorded unexpectedly. The H.E.S.S Collaboration argued that such results may challenge the state-of-the-art models for the high-energy emission of pulsars. We point out in this work that these results also provide a unique opportunity to constrain certain Lorentz invariance violation parameters, leading to the realization of studying Lorentz invariance violation by using gamma-ray pulsars. The Lorentz invariance violation scale is constrained at the level of $E_{\mathrm{LV,}1}> 1.66\times 10^{17} \rm GeV$ for the linear scenario, and $E_{\mathrm{LV,}2}>3.53\times 10^{10} \rm GeV$ for the quadratic scenario. We anticipate that digging into the detailed features of the data of the Vela pulsar and analyzing potentially more very-high-energy photon data from pulsars in the future would improve the constraints on Lorentz invariance violation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the detection of a secondary outflow associated with a Class I source, Ser-emb 15, in the Serpens Molecular Cloud. We reveal two pairs of molecular outflows consisting of three lobes, namely primary and secondary outflows, using ALMA 12CO and SiO line observations at a resolution of 318 au. The secondary outflow is elongated approximately perpendicular to the axis of the primary outflow in the plane of the sky. We also identify two compact structures, Sources A and B, within an extended structure associated with Ser-emb 15 in the 1.3 mm continuum emission at a resolution of 40 au. The projected sizes of Sources A and B are 137 au and 60 au, respectively. Assuming a dust temperature of 20 K, we estimate the dust mass to be 0.0024 Msun for Source A and 0.00033 Msun for Source B. C18O line data imply the existence of rotational motion around the extended structure, however, cannot resolve rotational motion in Source A and/or B, due to insufficient angular and frequency resolutions. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether Ser-emb 15 is a single or binary system. Thus, either Source A or B could drive the secondary outflow. We discuss two scenarios to explain the driving mechanism of the primary and secondary outflows: the Ser-emb 15 system is (1) a binary system composed of Source A and B or (2) a single star system composed of only Source A. In either case, the system could be a suitable target for investigating the disk and/or binary formation processes in complicated environments. Detecting these outflows should contribute to understanding complex star-forming environments, which may be common in the star-formation processes.
#### Measuring the cosmological 21-cm dipole with 21-cm global experiments

 - **Abstract**
 A measurement of the 21-cm global signal would be a revealing probe of the Dark Ages, the era of first star formation, and the Epoch of Reionization. It has remained elusive owing to bright galactic and extra-galactic foreground contaminants, coupled with instrumental noise, ionospheric effects, and beam chromaticity. The simultaneous detection of a consistent 21-cm dipole signal alongside the 21-cm global signal would provide confidence in a claimed detection. We use simulated data to investigate the possibility of using drift-scan dipole antenna experiments to achieve a detection of both monopole and dipole. We find that at least two antennae located at different latitudes are required to localise the dipole. In the absence of foregrounds, a total integration time of $\sim 10^4$ hours is required to detect the dipole. With contamination by simple foregrounds, we find that the integration time required increases to $\sim 10^5$ hours. We show that the extraction of the 21-cm dipole from more realistic foregrounds requires a more sophisticated foreground modelling approach. Finally, we motivate a global network of dipole antennae that could reasonably detect the dipole in $\sim 10^3$ hours of integration time.

 - **Abstract**
 A detailed analysis of the Nuclear Stellar Cluster (NSC) concedes not only the existence of the Scluster with its fast-moving stars and the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. It also reveals an embedded region of gas and dust with an exceptionally high stellar density called IRS 13. The IRS 13 cluster can be divided into the northern and the eastern counterparts, called IRS 13N and IRS 13E, respectively. This work will focus on both regions and study their most prominent members using rich infrared and radio/submm data baselines. Applying a multiwavelength analysis enables us to determine a comprehensive photometric footprint of the investigated cluster sample. Using the raytracing-based radiative transfer model HYPERION, the spectral energy distribution of the IRS 13 members suggests a stellar nature of the dusty sources. These putative Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) have a comparable spectroscopic identification to the D and G sources in or near the S cluster. Furthermore, we report the existence of a population of dusty sources in IRS 13 that can be mostly identified in the H-, K-, and Lband. Together with the objects reported in literature, we propose that this population is the outcome of a recent star formation process. Furthermore, we report that these presumably young objects are arranged in a disk structure. Although it cannot be excluded that the intrinsic arrangement of IRS 13 does show a disk structure, we find indications that the investigated cluster sample might be related to the counterclockwise disk.
#### Radiation Modes in FRB 20220912A Microshots and a Crab PSR nanoshot

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06173
 - **Abstract**
 A microshot from FRB 20220912A \citep{H23} satisfies the uncertainty relation $\Delta \omega \Delta t \ge 1$ by a factor of only $\lessapprox 3$. A Crab pulsar nanoshot \citep{HE07} exceeds this bound by a similar factor. The number of orthogonal plasma modes contributing to the coherent radiation is also $\approx \Delta \omega \Delta t$, placing constraints on their excitation and growth.

 - **Abstract**
 Diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) are absorption features seen in optical and infrared spectra of stars that are probably caused by large and complex molecules in the ISM. Here we investigate the Galactic distribution and properties of two DIBs identified in almost six million stellar spectra collected by the Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrometer. These measurements constitute a part of the Gaia Focused Product Release to be made public between the Gaia DR3 and DR4 data releases. In order to isolate the DIB signal from the stellar features in each individual spectrum, we identified a set of 160 000 spectra at high Galactic latitudes which we consider to be the DIB-free reference sample. Matching each target spectrum to its closest reference spectra in stellar parameter space allowed us to remove the stellar spectrum empirically, without reference to stellar models, leaving a set of six million ISM spectra. Identifying the two DIBs at 862.1 nm and 864.8 nm in the stacked spectra, we modelled their shapes and report the depth, central wavelength, width, and equivalent width (EW) for each, along with confidence bounds on these measurements. Our main results are as follows: (1) the strength and spatial distribution of the DIB $\lambda$862.1 are very consistent with what was found in Gaia DR3, but for this work we attained a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the stacked spectra to larger distances, which allowed us to trace DIBs in the outer spiral arm and beyond the Scutum--Centaurus spiral arm; (2) we produced an all-sky map below ${\pm}65^{\circ}$ of Galactic latitude to $\sim$4000 pc of both DIB features and their correlations; (3) we detected the signals of DIB\,$\lambda$862.1 inside the Local Bubble; and (4) there is a reasonable correlation with the dust reddening found from stellar absorption and EWs of both DIBs.

 - **Abstract**
 The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2), successfully launched from Wanaka, New Zealand on May 13, 2022, is a precursor for a space-based astroparticle observatory such as the Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA). EUSO-SPB2 flew two custom telescopes. Both have UV/UV-visible sensitivity and feature Schmidt optics. The Fluorescence Telescope (FT) measures ultra-high energy cosmic rays by looking down. The \v{C}erenkov Telescope (CT) searches for neutrino signatures by looking toward Earth's limb. The two telescopes each have a 1 m diameter entrance pupil and segmented glass mirrors that collect light from extensive air showers at the PeV and EeV-scale. Here we describe the FT telescope optics together with the results of the FT field tests at the Utah Telescope Array (TA) site from August/September 2022. The FT recorded the night sky background, lasers, and artificial point sources. The field tests included an absolute photometric calibration of the FT telescope that is compared to a piece-wise laboratory calibration.

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars (MSP) are an important subclass of rotation powered pulsars (RPP), traditionally defined as those with $P_s < 20-30$~ms and $B_s \lesssim 10^{10}$~G. We re-examine this definition by applying Gaussian mixture model (GMM) analysis to identify distinct clusters within the RPP population and find that the MSPs appear to be better demarcated by the condition $\mathbf{P_s \lesssim 16}$~ms.
#### Effects of Metallicity on the Instability Mass Ratio of Low Mass Contact  Binary Systems

 - **Abstract**
 The orbital stability of contact binary systems has been receiving considerable attention recently. Theoretical studies indicate that merger is likely to occur at very low mass ratios, but the actual mass ratio at which merger may take place is likely to be variable and dependent on the mass of the primary. We consider the effects of metal content on the orbital stability of contact binary systems by modelling the gyration radius of a rotating and tidally distorted primary component at various values of metallicity in the range -1.25 to +0.5. We determine the instability mass ratio range for contact binary systems with a low mass primary in the range 0.6M(sun) to 1.4M(sun) at various metallicity levels and show that systems with low metallicity have an instability mass ratio lower than those with higher metal content and therefore are likely to be more stable. We illustrate the effect through light curve analysis of two otherwise very similar contact binary systems, except for different metallicity. While both would be considered unstable if metallicity was not taken into consideration, only one remains in that category after appropriate adjustments based on metallicity have been made.

 - **Abstract**
 This study theoretically predicted the specific Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules to satisfy both astronomically observed Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIB) and Infrared Bands (IR). Under astronomical top-down material creation scheme, we have previously found the hydrocarbon pentagon-hexagon combined PAH molecules by comparing observed IR with Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculated molecular vibrational spectrum. Molecules were (C53H18), (C23H12) and (C12H8). Origin of DIB may come from the photoexcitation between molecular orbitals. For those molecules, we calculated excitation energy by the time dependent DFT. In case of (C53H18), mono cation shows calculated 722nm excitation band coincide well with observed DIB at 722.31nm, also calculated 693nm coincide with observed 693.90nm. Di-cation one also shows good coincidence by calculated 864nm with 864.82nm DIB. For middle sized molecule (C23H12), mono cation shows calculated 617nm coincidence with observed 617.73nm, also calculated 645nm with observed 645.16nm. Smaller sized di-cation molecule of (C12H8) show calculated band of 440nm roughly related to observed 442.89nm DIB. By this study, we could indicate the pentagon hexagon combined PAH would be promising candidate floating in interstellar space.

 - **Abstract**
 Fine-grained nuclear emulsion films have been developed as a tracking detector with nanometric spatial resolution to be used in direction-sensitive dark matter searches, thanks to novel readout technologies capable of exploiting this unprecedented resolution. Emulsion detectors are time insensitive. Therefore, a directional dark matter search with such detector requires the use of an equatorial telescope to absorb the Earth rotation effect. We have conducted for the first time a directional dark matter search in an unshielded location, at the sea level, by keeping an emulsion detector exposed for 39 days on an equatorial telescope. The observed angular distribution of the data collected during an exposure equivalent to 0.59 g days agrees with the background model and an exclusion plot was then derived in the dark matter mass and cross-section plane: cross-sections higher than 1.1 $\times$10$^{-28}$ cm$^{2}$ and $1.1 \times 10^{-31}$ cm$^2$ were excluded for a dark matter mass of $10$ GeV$/c^2$ and $100$ GeV$/c^2$, respectively. This is the first direction sensitive search for dark matter with a solid-state, particle tracking detector.

 The Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) is a high contrast imaging instrument that aims to detect and characterize extrasolar planets. GPI is being upgraded to GPI 2.0, with several subsystems receiving a re-design to improve the instrument's contrast. To enable observations on fainter targets and increase stability on brighter ones, one of the upgrades is to the adaptive optics system. The current Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (WFS) is being replaced by a pyramid WFS with an low-noise electron multiplying CCD (EMCCD). EMCCDs are detectors capable of counting single photon events at high speed and high sensitivity. In this work, we characterize the performance of the HN\"u 240 EMCCD from N\"uv\"u Cameras, which was custom-built for GPI 2.0. The HN\"u 240 EMCCD's characteristics make it well suited for extreme AO: it has low dark current ($<$ 0.01 e-/pix/fr), low readout noise (0.1 e-/pix/fr at a gain of 5000), high quantum efficiency ( 90% at wavelengths from 600-800 nm; 70% from 800-900 nm), and fast readout (up to 3000 fps full frame). Here we present test results on the EMCCD's noise contributors, such as the readout noise, pixel-to-pixel variability and CCD bias. We also tested the linearity and EM gain calibration of the detector. All camera tests were conducted before its integration into the GPI 2.0 PWFS system.

 - **Abstract**
 Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars of the WNh category contain a significant fraction of hydrogen at their surface. They can be hydrogen-burning, very massive stars or stars in a post-main sequence phase of evolution. Also, WNh stars are sometimes not included in population synthesis models. We aim to better characterise the properties of single WNh stars in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. In particular, we want to constrain their surface chemistry beyond the hydrogen content by determining the helium, carbon, and nitrogen surface abundances. We perform a spectroscopic analysis of 22 single WNh stars. We fit their ultraviolet and/or optical spectra using synthetic spectra computed with the code CMFGEN. We determine the main stellar parameters (temperature, luminosity, mass-loss rates) and the surface H, He, C, and N mass fractions. We investigate the ability of current evolutionary models to reproduce all parameters at the same time. We find that all WNh stars show the signatures of CNO-cycle material at their surface: they are carbon-depleted and nitrogen-rich. A clear trend of higher nitrogen content at higher metallicity is observed, as expected. The amount of hydrogen (X) varies significantly from one star to another, independently of luminosity. Values of X larger than 0.4 are not exceptional. The majority of Galactic WNh stars can be explained by evolutionary models, provided sufficient fine-tuning of the input parameters of evolutionary calculations. At lower metallicity, most stars escape predictions from evolutionary models. This has been noted in the literature but constraints on the surface nitrogen content exacerbate this severe issue. Our study highlights the need to refine the treatment of WR stars in both stellar evolution and population synthesis models.

 - **Abstract**
 The aim of this paper is, making use of the Gaia DR3 catalogue and Virtual Observatory tools, to confirm and characterize 428 binary and multiple stellar systems classified as neglected (only one observation) in the Washington Double Star Catalogue (WDS). The components of the stellar systems have the same parallax and proper motion (within the errors) and are separated by less than 50 000 AU, which minimizes the number of by-chance counterparts. Effective temperatures calculated using VOSA were used to estimate stellar masses. Binding energies were calculated for 42 binary systems confirming they are physical pairs. Also we found 75 pairs with F/G- M spectral types which are very interesting to improve the determination of the metallicity of the M star from the higher-mass component.

 - **Abstract**
 LISA will detect $\sim \! 10^4$ Galactic binaries, the majority being double white dwarfs. However, approximately $\sim \! 1 \textrm{--} 5 \%$ of these systems will contain neutron stars which, if they can be correctly identified, will provide new opportunities for studying binary evolution pathways involving mass reversal and supernovae as well as being promising targets for multi-messenger observations. Eccentricity, expected from neutron star natal kicks, will be a key identifying signature for binaries containing a neutron star. Eccentric binaries radiate at widely-spaced frequency harmonics that must first be identified as originating from a single source and then analysed coherently. A multi-harmonic heterodyning approach for this type of data analysis is used to perform Bayesian parameter estimation on a range of simulated eccentric LISA signals. This is used to: (i) investigate LISA's ability to measure orbital eccentricity and to quantify the minimum detectable eccentricity; (ii) demonstrate how eccentricity and periastron precession help to break the mass degeneracy allowing the individual component masses to be inferred, potentially confirming the presence of a neutron star; (iii) investigate the possibility of source misidentification when the individual harmonics of an eccentric binary masquerade as separate circular binaries; and (iv) investigate the possibility of source reclassification, where parameter estimation results of multiple circular analyses are combined in postprocessing to quickly infer the parameters of an eccentric source. The broader implications of this for the ongoing design of the LISA global fit are also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the optical, UV, and soft X-ray observations of the $2017-2022$ eruptions of the recurrent nova M31N 2008-12a. We infer a steady decrease in the accretion rate over the years based on the inter-eruption recurrence period. We find a ``cusp'' feature in the $r'$ and $i'$ band light curves close to the peak, which could be associated to jets. Spectral modelling indicates a mass ejection of 10$^{-7}$ to 10$^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$ during each eruption, and an enhanced Helium abundance of He/He$_{\odot}$ $\approx$ 3. The super-soft source (SSS) phase shows significant variability, which is anti-correlated to the UV emission, indicating a common origin. The variability could be due to the reformation of the accretion disk. A comparison of the accretion rate with different models on the $\rm M_{WD}$$-\dot{M}$ plane yields the mass of a CO WD, powering the ``H-shell flashes'' every $\sim$ 1 year to be $>1.36$ M$_{\odot}$ and growing with time, making M31N 2008-12a a strong candidate for the single degenerate scenario of Type Ia supernovae progenitor.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spectral analysis of \textit{Insight}-HXMT observations of the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1543-47 which locates in our Milky Way galaxy during the 2021 outburst. We focus on the observations in its soft state, and attempt to determine the spin of the black hole candidate through Thermal-Continuum Fitting (CF) method. The spin derived from CF method is highly dependent on black hole mass, distance and inclination angle of inner disk. In this article, we have adopted the preferred range of parameters: $M=9.4\pm 1 M_{\odot}$, D=$7.5{\pm}0.5$ kpc and $i=36.3^{+5.3}_{-3.4}$ degrees. We attain a moderate spin, $a=0.46\pm0.12$, which is consistent with previous results measured in the 2002 outburst. Besides, we notice the spectra show a wide blue shifted absorption feature between 8-10 keV which would originate from the highly ionized iron line. We try to fit the feature with {\em xstar} model and suggest that this feature may come from relativistic disk wind with a velocity of $v_{\rm wind}\sim 0.2c$. We attribute this relativistic disk wind to the super-Eddington accretion during the black hole outburst.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations and theoretical progress made about the history of the Earth-Moon system suggest that tidal dissipation in oceans primarily drives the long term evolution of orbital systems hosting ocean planets. Particularly, they emphasise the key role played by the geometry of land-ocean distributions in this mechanism. However, the complex way continents affect oceanic tides still remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we investigate the impact of a single supercontinent on the tidal response of an ocean planet and the induced tidally dissipated energy. The adopted approach is based on the linear tidal theory. By simplifying the continent to a spherical cap of given angular radius and position on the globe, we proceed to a harmonic analysis of the whole planet's tidal response including the coupling with the solid part due to ocean loading and self-attraction variations. In this framework, tidal flows are formulated analytically in terms of explicitly defined oceanic eigenmodes, as well as the resulting tidal Love numbers, dissipated power, and torque. The analysis highlights the symmetry breaking effect of the continent, which makes the dependence of tidal quantities on the tidal frequency become highly irregular. The metric introduced to quantify this continentality effect reveals abrupt transitions between polar and non-polar configurations, and between small-sized and medium-sized continents. Additionally, it predicts that a continent similar to South America or smaller (30{\deg}-angular radius) does not alter qualitatively the tidal response of a global ocean whatever its position on the planet.

 - **Abstract**
 The development of state-of-the-art spectrographs has ushered in a new era in the detection and characterization of exoplanetary systems. Our objective is to utilize the high-resolution and precision capabilities of the ESPRESSO instrument to detect and measure the broad-band transmission spectrum of HD 189733b's atmosphere. Additionally, we aim to employ an improved Rossiter-McLaughlin model to derive properties related to the velocity fields of the stellar surface and to constrain the orbital architecture. Our results demonstrate a high degree of precision in fitting the observed radial velocities during transit using the improved modeling of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. We tentatively detect the effect of differential rotation with a confidence level of $93.4 \%$ when considering a rotation period within the photometric literature values, and $99.6\%$ for a broader range of rotation periods. For the former, the amplitude of differential rotation ratio suggests an equatorial rotation period of $11.45\pm 0.09$ days and a polar period of $14.9\pm 2$. The addition of differential rotation breaks the latitudinal symmetry, enabling us to measure the true spin-orbit angle $ \psi \approx 13.6 \pm 6.9 ^\circ$ and the stellar inclination axis angle $ i_{\star} \approx 71.87 ^{+6.91^\circ}_{-5.55^\circ}$. Moreover, we determine a sub-solar amplitude of the convective blueshift velocity $V_{CB}$ $\approx$ $-211 ^{+69} _{-61}$ m$\,$s$ ^{-1}$, which falls within the expected range for a K-dwarf host star and is compatible with both runs. Finally, we successfully retrieved the transmission spectrum of HD 189733b from the high-resolution ESPRESSO data. We observe a significant decrease in radius with increasing wavelength, consistent with the phenomenon of super-Rayleigh scattering.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the detection of type-C quasi-periodic oscillations during the initial stages of the outburst of Swift J1727.8-1613 in 2023. Using data of the INTEGRAL observatory along with the data of the SRG/ART-XC and Swift/XRT telescopes the fast growth of the QPO frequency was traced. We present a hard X-ray lightcurve that covers the initial stages of the 2023 outburst - the fast rise and plateau - and demonstrate that the QPO frequency was stable during the plateau. The switching from type-C to type-B QPO was detected with the beginning of the source flaring activity. We have constructed a broad-band spectrum of Swift J1727.8-1613 and found an additional hard power-law spectral component extending at least up to 400 keV. Finally, we have obtained an upper limit on the hard X-ray flux at the beginning of the optical outburst and estimated the delay of the X-ray outburst with respect to the optical one.

 - **Abstract**
 The tightest constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ can only be obtained after removing a substantial fraction of the lensing $B$-mode sample variance. The planned CMB-S4 experiment\footnote{\url{cmb-s4.org}} will remove the lensing $B$-mode signal internally by reconstructing the gravitational lenses from high-resolution observations. We document here a first lensing reconstruction pipeline able to achieve this optimally for arbitrary sky coverage. We make it part of a map-based framework to test CMB-S4 delensing performance and its constraining power on $r$, including inhomogeneous noise and two non-Gaussian Galactic polarized foreground models. The framework performs component-separation of the high-resolution maps, followed by the construction of lensing $B$-mode templates, which are then included in a parametric small-aperture maps cross-spectra-based likelihood for $r$. We find that the lensing reconstruction and framework achieve the expected performance, compatible with the target $\sigma(r) \simeq 5\cdot 10^{-4}$ in the absence of a tensor signal, after an effective removal of $92\%$ to $93\%$ of the lensing $B$-mode variance, depending on the simulation set. The code for the lensing reconstruction can also be used for cross-correlation studies with large-scale structures, lensing spectrum reconstruction, cluster lensing, or other CMB lensing-related purposes. As part of our tests we also demonstrate joint optimal reconstruction of the lensing potential with the lensing curl potential mode, second-order in the density fluctuations.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we provide a macroscopic model to predict the radar echo signatures found when a radio signal is reflected from a cosmic-ray or neutrino-induced particle cascade propagating in a dense medium like ice. Its macroscopic nature allows for an energy independent runtime, taking less than 10 s for simulating a single scatter event. As a first application, we discuss basic signal properties and simulate the expected signal for the T-576 beam-test experiment at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). We find good signal strength agreement with the only observed radar echo from a high-energy particle cascade to date.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite increasingly precise observations and sophisticated theoretical models, the discrepancy between measurements of H0 from the cosmic microwave background or from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations combined with Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis versus those from local distance ladder probes -- commonly known as the $H_0$ tension -- continues to perplex the scientific community. To address this tension, Early Dark Energy (EDE) models have been proposed as alternatives to $\Lambda$CDM, as they can change the observed sound horizon and the inferred Hubble constant from measurements based on this. In this paper, we investigate the use of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to evaluate EDE as a solution to the H0 tension. BMA consists of assigning a prior to the model and deriving a posterior as for any other unknown parameter in a Bayesian analysis. BMA can be computationally challenging in that one must approximate the joint posterior of both model and parameters. Here we present a computational strategy for BMA that exploits existing MCMC software and combines model-specific posteriors post-hoc. In application to a comprehensive analysis of cosmological datasets, we quantify the impact of EDE on the H0 discrepancy. We find an EDE model probability of $\sim$90% whenever we include the H0 measurement from Type Ia Supernovae in the analysis, whereas the other data show a strong preference for the standard cosmological model. We finally present constraints on common parameters marginalized over both cosmological models. For reasonable priors on models with and without EDE, the H0 tension is reduced by at least 20%.

 Context. Stars that are members of stellar clusters are assumed to be formed at the same time and place from material with the same initial chemical composition. These additional constraints on the ensemble of cluster stars make these stars suitable as benchmarks. Aims. We aimed 1) to identify previously unknown red giants in the open clusters NGC 6791 and NGC 6819, 2) to extract their asteroseismic parameters, and 3) to determine their cluster membership. Methods. We followed a dedicated method based on difference imaging to extract the light curves of potential red giants in NGC 6791 and NGC 6819 from Kepler superstamp data. We extracted the asteroseismic parameters of the stars that showed solar-like oscillations. We performed an asteroseismic membership study to identify which of these stars are likely to be cluster members. Results. We found 149 red giant stars within the Kepler superstamps, 93 of which are likely cluster members. We were able to find 29 red giants that are not primary targets of Kepler, and therefore, their light curves had not been released previously. Five of these previously unknown red giants have a cluster membership probability greater than 95%.

 - **Abstract**
 The era of the James Webb Space Telescope ushers stellar populations models into uncharted territories, particularly at the high-redshift frontier. In a companion paper, we apply the \texttt{Prospector} Bayesian framework to jointly infer galaxy redshifts and stellar populations properties from broad-band photometry as part of the UNCOVER survey. Here we present a comprehensive error budget in spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. Using a $z_{\rm phot}>9$ sample, we quantify the systematic shifts stemming from various model choices in inferred stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and age. These choices encompass different timescales for changes in the star formation history (SFH), non-universal stellar initial mass functions (IMF), and the inclusion of variable nebular abundances, gas density and ionizing photon budget. We find that the IMF exerts the strongest influence on the inferred properties: the systematic uncertainties can be as much as 1 dex, 2--5 times larger than the formal reported uncertainties in mass and SFR; and importantly, exceed the scatter seen when using different SED fitting codes. This means that a common practice in the literature of assessing uncertainties in SED-fitting processes by comparing multiple codes is substantively underestimating the true systematic uncertainty. Highly stochastic SFHs change the inferred SFH by much larger than the formal uncertainties, and introduce $\sim 0.8$ dex systematics in SFR and $\sim 0.3$ dex systematics in average age. Finally, employing a flexible nebular emission model causes $\sim 0.2$ dex systematic increase in mass, comparable to the formal uncertainty. This paper constitutes one of the initial steps toward a complete uncertainty estimate in SED modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the coordinated observations of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (NS-LMXB) \gx in X-rays (IXPE, NICER, Nustar and INTEGRAL), optical (REM and LCO), near-infrared (REM), mid-infrared (VLT VISIR), and radio (ATCA). This Z-source was observed by \IXPE twice in March-April 2023 (Obs. 1 and 2). In the radio band, the source was detected, but only upper-limits to the linear polarization were obtained at a $3\sigma$ level of $6.1\%$ at 5.5 GHz and $5.9\%$ at 9 GHz in Obs.~1 and $12.5\%$ at 5.5~GHz and $20\%$ at 9~GHz in Obs.~2. The mid-IR, near-IR and optical observations suggest the presence of a compact jet which peaks in the mid- or far-IR. The X-ray polarization degree was found to be $3.7\% \pm 0.4 \%$ (at $90\%$ confidence level) during Obs.~1 when the source was in the horizontal branch of the Z-track and $1.8\% \pm 0.4 \%$ during Obs.~2 when the source was in the normal-flaring branch. These results confirm the variation of polarization degree as a function of the position of the source in the color-color diagram as for previously observed Z-track sources (Cyg~X-2 and XTE~1701$-$462). Evidence for a variation of the polarization angle $\sim 20^\circ$ with energy is found in both observations, likely related to the different, non-orthogonal polarization angles of the disk and Comptonization components which peak at different energies.
#### Using a quench level approximation to estimate the effect of metallicity  on N-bearing species abundances in H2-dominated atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 Variations in atmospheric elemental nitrogen can considerably affect the abundance of major nitrogen-bearing species such as NH$_3$ and HCN. Also, due to vertical mixing and photochemistry, their abundance deviates from the thermochemical equilibrium. The goal of this study is to understand the effect of atmospheric metallicity on the composition of NH$_3$, N$_2$, and HCN over a large parameter space in the presence of vertical mixing which, when combined with the work on CHO-bearing species in Soni and Acharyya (2023) can provide a comprehensive understanding of the effect of atmospheric metallicity. We used quenching approximations and a full chemical kinetics model for the calculations, and a comparison between these two methods was made. For generating thermal profiles, petitRADTRANS code is used. Chemical timescales of NH$_3$ and N$_2$ are found to be complex functions of metallicity, while HCN is inversely proportional. Using NH$_3$ and CO quenched abundances, the HCN quenched abundance can be constrained since it remains in equilibrium with NH$_3$, CO, and H$_2$O. Quenched NH$_3$ increases with increasing K$_{zz}$ untill a particular point, after which it becomes independent of vertical mixing. There is a sweet spot in the K$_{zz}$ parameter space to maximize the quenched HCN for a given T$_{int}$ and T$_{equi}$; the parameter space moves towards the lower equilibrium temperature, and HCN abundance increases with metallicity. Finally, we used the dataset of quenched abundances to provide a list of potential candidates in which HCN observation can be possible.

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of the interacting, eccentric orbit binary V1507 Cyg (HD187399) are examined with spectra that cover wavelengths from 0.63 to 0.68um. The spectrum of the brightest star is very similar to that of the B8 I star Beta Ori, although with absorption lines that show sub-structure consistent with a varying tidal field. The bulk of the Halpha emission in the spectrum appears to be associated with the brighter star. Evidence is presented that the period of the system has been stable over timescales of many decades, arguing against large-scale mass transfer at the current epoch. Absorption and emission lines are identified that originate in an expanding asymmetric envelope around the companion, and component masses of 6.4 +/- 0.9 and 14.0 +/- 0.9 solar are found, where the former applies to the brighter star and an inclination of 46 degrees has been assumed. The evolutionary state of V1507 Cyg is then that of a system in which mass transfer has progressed to the point where the mass ratio has been reversed, with the brighter star stripped of much of its initial mass. It is argued that the brighter star is an Alpha Cyg variable, and that it is those light variations that dominate the system light curve. V1507 Cyg is observed at or near the center of a diffuse HI bubble that is detected at 408 and 1420MHz. It is suggested that the eccentric orbit is the result of evolution in a hierarchical system.

 - **Abstract**
 The Nuclear Spectroscopic Array (NuSTAR) observed the gamma-ray binary LS 5039 for a second time in order to check for the presence of a periodic signal candidate found in the data from the previous NuSTAR observation. We do not detect the candidate signal in the vicinity of its previously reported frequency, assuming the same orbital ephemeris as in our previous paper. This implies that the previously reported periodic signal candidate was a noise fluctuation. We also perform a comparison of the lightcurves from the two NuSTAR observations and the joint spectral fitting. Our spectral analysis confirms the phase-dependence found from a single NuSTAR observation at a higher significance level.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from 3D simulations of the Archean Earth including a prescribed (non-interactive) spherical haze generated through a 1D photochemical model. Our simulations suggest that a thin haze layer, formed when CH4/CO2 = 0.1, leads to global warming of ~10.6 K due to the change of water vapour and cloud feedback, compared to the simulation without any haze. However, a thicker haze layer, formed when CH4/CO2 > 0.1, leads to global cooling of up to ~65 K as the scattering and absorption of shortwave radiation from the haze reduces the radiation from reaching the planetary surface. A thermal inversion is formed with a lower tropopause as the CH4/CO2 ratio increases. The haze reaches an optical threshold thickness when CH4/CO2 ~ 0.175 beyond which the atmospheric structure and the global surface temperature do not vary much.

 - **Abstract**
 The long term broadband spectral study of Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars during different flux states has the potential to infer the emission mechanisms and the cause of spectral variations. To scrutinize this, we performed a detailed broadband spectral analysis of 3C 279 using simultaneous Swift-XRT/UVOT and Fermi-LAT observations spanning from August 2008 to June 2022. We also supplement this with the simultaneous NuSTAR observations of the source. The optical/UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray spectra were individually fitted by a power-law to study the long-term variation in the flux and the spectral indices. A combined spectral fit of simultaneous optical/UV and X-ray spectra was also performed to obtain the transition energy at which the spectral energy distribution is minimum. The correlation analysis suggests that the long-term spectral variations of the source are mainly associated with the variations in the low energy index and the break energy of the broken power-law electron distribution which is responsible for the broadband emission. The flux distribution of the source represents a log-normal variability while the gamma-ray flux distribution showed a clear double log-normal behavior. The spectral index distributions were again normal except for gamma-ray which showed a double-Gaussian behavior. This indicates that the log-normal variability of the source may be associated with the normal variations in the spectral index. The broadband spectral fit of the source using synchrotron and inverse Compton processes indicates different emission processes are active at optical/UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray energies.

 - **Abstract**
 A simple one-dimensional axisymmetric disc model is applied to the kinematics of OB stars near the Sun obtained from Gaia DR3 catalogue. The model determines the 'local centrifugal speed' $V_\mathrm{c}(R_{0})$ - defined as the circular velocity in the Galactocentric rest frame, where the star would move in a near-circular orbit if the potential is axisymmetric with the local potential of the Galaxy. We find that the $V_\mathrm{c}(R_{0})$ values and their gradient vary across the selected region of stars within the solar neighbourhood. By comparing with an N-body/hydrodynamic simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy, we find that the kinematics of the young stars in the solar neighbourhood is affected by the Local arm, which makes it difficult to measure $V_\mathrm{c}(R_{0})$. However, from the resemblance between the observational data and the simulation, we suggest that the known rotational velocity gap between the Coma Bernices and Hyades-Pleiades moving groups could be driven by the co-rotation resonance of the Local arm, which can be used to infer the azimuthally averaged circular velocity. We find that $V_\mathrm{c}(R)$ obtained from the $\mathrm{D}<2$ kpc sample is well matched with this gap at the position of the Local arm. Hence, we argue that our results from the $\mathrm{D}<2$ kpc sample, $V_\mathrm{c}(R_{0})= 233.95\pm2.24$ km $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, is close to the azimuthally averaged circular velocity rather than the local centrifugal speed, which is influenced by the presence of the Local arm.
