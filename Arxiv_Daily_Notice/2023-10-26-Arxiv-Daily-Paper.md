 - **Abstract**
 Characterizing the physical properties of cool supergiants allows us to probe the final stages of a massive star's evolution before it undergoes core collapse. Despite their importance, the fundamental properties for these stars -- $T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log L/L_\odot$ -- are only known for a limited number of objects. The third data release of the Gaia mission contains precise photometry and low-resolution spectroscopy of hundreds of cool supergiants in the LMC with well-constrained properties. Using these data, we train a simple and easily-interpretable machine learning model to regress effective temperatures and luminosities with high accuracy and precision comparable to the training data. We then apply our model to 5000 cool supergiants, many of which have no previously-published $T_{\rm eff}$ or $L$ estimates. The resulting Hertzprung-Russell diagram is well-populated, allowing us to study the distribution of cool supergiants in great detail. Examining the luminosity functions of our sample, we find a notable flattening in the luminosity function of yellow supergiants above $\log L/L_\odot=5$, and a corresponding steepening of the red supergiant luminosity function. We place this finding in context with previous results, and present its implications for the infamous red supergiant problem.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high cadence optical and ultraviolet observations of the Type II supernova (SN), SN 2022jox which exhibits early spectroscopic high ionization flash features of \ion{H}{1}, \ion{He}{2}, \ion{C}{4}, and \ion{N}{4} that disappear within the first few days after explosion. SN 2022jox was discovered by the Distance Less than 40 Mpc (DLT40) survey $\sim$0.75 days after explosion with followup spectra and UV photometry obtained within minutes of discovery. The SN reached a peak brightness of M$_V \sim$ $-$17.3 mag, and has an estimated $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.04 M$_{\odot}$, typical values for normal Type II SNe. The modeling of the early lightcurve and the strong flash signatures present in the optical spectra indicate interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) created from a progenitor with a mass loss rate of $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}\ M_\odot\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. There may also be some indication of late-time CSM interaction in the form of an emission line blueward of H$\alpha$ seen in spectra around 200 days. The mass-loss rate is much higher than the values typically associated with quiescent mass loss from red supergiants, the known progenitors of Type II SNe, but is comparable to inferred values from similar core collapse SNe with flash features, suggesting an eruptive event or a superwind in the progenitor in the months or years before explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the Voids-within-Voids-within-Voids (VVV) simulations, a suite of successive nested N-body simulations with extremely high resolution (denoted, from low to high resolution, by L0 to L7), to test the Press-Schechter (PS), Sheth-Tormen (ST), and extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formulae for the halo abundance over the entire mass range, from mini-haloes of $10^{-6}\ \mathrm{M_\odot}$, to rich cluster haloes of $10^{15}\ \mathrm{M_\odot}$, at different redshifts, from $z=30$ to the present. We find that at $z=0$ and $z=2$, ST gives the best prediction for the results of L0, which has the mean cosmic density (i.e. overdensity $\delta=0$), at $10^{11-15} ~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. The higher resolution levels (L1-L7) are biased regions at various underdensities ($\delta<-0.6$). The EPS formalism takes this into account since it gives the mass function of a region conditioned, in this case, on having a given underdensity. The EPS gives good predictions for these higher levels, with deviations $\lesssim 20\%$, at $10^{-6-12.5} ~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. At $z \sim 7-15$, the ST predictions for L0 and the EPS predictions for L1-L7 show somewhat larger deviations from the simulation results. However, at even higher redshifts, $z \sim 30$, the EPS prediction fits the simulations well again. We further confirm our results by picking more subvolumes from the full L0 simulation, finding that our conclusions depend only weakly on the size and overdensity of the chosen region. Since at mean density the EPS reduces to the PS mass function, its good agreement with the higher-level simulations implies that the PS (or, even better, the ST) formula gives an accurate description of the total halo mass function in representative regions of the universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanets have been detected around stars at various stages of their lives, ranging from young stars emerging from formation, to latter stages of evolution, including white dwarfs and neutron stars. Post main sequence stellar evolution can result in dramatic, and occasionally traumatic, alterations to the planetary system architecture, such as tidal disruption of planets and engulfment by the host star. The $\rho$ CrB system is a particularly interesting case of advanced main sequence evolution, due to the relative late age and brightness of the host star, its similarity to solar properties, and the harboring of four known planets. Here, we use stellar evolution models to estimate the expected trajectory of the $\rho$ CrB stellar properties, especially over the coming 1.0-1.5 billion years as it evolves off the main sequence. We show that the inner three planets (e, b, and c) are engulfed during the red giant phase and asymptotic giant branch, likely destroying those planets via either evaporation or tidal disruption at the fluid body Roche limit. The outer planet, planet d, is briefly engulfed by the star several times toward the end of the asymptotic giant branch, but the stellar mass loss and subsequent changing planetary orbit may allow the survival of the planet into the white dwarf phase of the stellar evolution. We discuss the implications of this outcome for similar systems, and describe the consequences for planets that may lie within the Habitable Zone of the system.
#### Dwindling Surface Cooling of a Rotating Jovian Planet Leads to a  Convection Zone that Grows to a Finite Depth

 - **Abstract**
 Recent measurements of Jupiter's gravitational field (by Juno) and seismology of Saturn's rings (by Cassini) strongly suggest that both planets have a stably-stratified core that still possesses a primordial gradient in the concentration of heavy elements. The existence of such a "diffusely" stratified core has been a surprise as it was long expected that the Jovian planets should be fully convective and hence fully mixed. A vigorous zone of convection, driven by surface cooling, forms at the surface and deepens through entrainment of fluid from underneath. In fact, it was believed that this convection zone should grow so rapidly that the entire planet would be consumed in less than a million years. Here we suggest that two processes, acting in concert, present a solution to this puzzle. All of the giant planets are rapidly rotating and have a cooling rate that declines with time. Both of these effects reduce the rate of fluid entrainment into the convection zone. Through the use of an analytic prescription of entrainment in giant planets, we demonstrate that these two effects, rotation and dwindling surface cooling, result in a convection zone which initially grows but eventually stalls. The depth to which the convective interface asymptotes depends on the rotation rate and on the stratification of the stable interior. Conversely, in a nonrotating planet, or in a planet that maintains a higher level of cooling than current models suggest, the convection zone deepens forever, eventually spanning the entire planet.
#### Material Around the Centaur (2060) Chiron from the 2018 November 28 UT  Stellar Occultation

 - **Abstract**
 A stellar occultation of Gaia DR3 2646598228351156352 by the Centaur (2060) Chiron was observed from the South African Astronomical Observatory on 2018 November 28 UT. Here we present a positive detection of material surrounding Chiron from the 74-in telescope for this event. Additionally, a global atmosphere is ruled out at the tens of mircobar level for several possible atmospheric compositions. There are multiple 3-sigma drops in the 74-in light curve: three during immersion and two during emersion. Occulting material is located between 242-270 km from the center of the nucleus in the sky plane. Assuming the ring-plane orientation proposed for Chiron from the 2011 occultation, the flux drops are located at 352, 344, and 316 km (immersion), and 357, and 364 km (emersion) from the center, with normal optical depths of 0.26, 0.36, and 0.22 (immersion) and 0.26 and 0.18 (emersion), and equivalent widths between 0.7-1.3 km. This detection is similar to the previously proposed two-ring system and is located within the error bars of that ring-pole plane; however, the normal optical depths are less than half of the previous values, and three features are detected on immersion. These results suggest that the properties of the surrounding material have evolved between the 2011, 2018, and 2022 observations.
#### The Wagging Plasma Tail of Comet C/2020 S3 (Erasmus)

 - **Abstract**
 Long-period comet C/2020 S3 (Erasmus) reached perihelion at 0.398 au on UT 2020 December 12.67, making it a bright, near-Sun object. Images taken between mid-November and December 2020 using the HI-1 camera and COR2 coronagraph onboard STEREO-A, as well as the LASCO/C3 coronagraph onboard SoHO, show significant variations in the plasma tail position angles. To analyze these variations, a simple technique was developed to calculate the aberration angles. These angles are defined as the angle between the sun-comet line and the tail axis, measured in the orbital plane. The aberration angles were found to range from $1.2^\circ$ to $46.8^\circ$, with an average (median) value of approximately $20.3^\circ$ ($16.3^\circ$). By considering the aberration angles, the solar wind radial velocities during the observations were inferred to range from 73.9 km/s to 573.5 km/s, with mean (median) values of approximately 205.5 km/s (182.3 km/s). Throughout the observations, two periods were identified where the tails showed forward tilting, which cannot be explained by aberration alone. In one case, this anomalous position angle was sustained for at least 11 days and is possibly due to co-rotating interaction regions. In the other case, the tail exhibited dramatic excursions from 180$^\circ$ to 150$^\circ$ back to 210$^\circ$ over a limited period of around 34 hours. This behavior is tentatively explained as a consequence of the interaction with a halo Coronal Mass Ejection that was launched from NOAA 12786 and arrived at comet C/2020 S3 during the time when the tail displayed its wagging behavior.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies of Galactic evolution revealed that the dynamics of the stellar component might be one of the key factors when considering galactic habitability. We run an N-body simulation model of the Milky Way, which we evolve for 10 Gyr, to study the secular evolution of stellar orbits and the resulting galactic habitability-related properties, i.e., the density of the stellar component and close stellar encounters. The results indicate that radial migrations are not negligible, even in a simple axisymmetric model with mild levels of dynamical heating, and that the net outward diffusion of the stellar component can populate galactic outskirts with habitable systems. Habitable environment is also likely even at sub-Solar galactocentric radii, because the rate of close encounters should not significantly degrade habitability. Stars that evolve from non-circular to stable nearly-circular orbits typically migrate outwards, settling down in a broad Solar neighborhood. The region between $R \approx 3$ kpc and $R \approx 12$ kpc represents the zone of radial mixing, which can blur the boundaries of the Galactic Habitable Zone, as it has been conventionally understood. The present-day stable population of the stars in the Solar neighborhood originates from this radial mixing zone, with most of the stars coming from the inner regions. The Solar system can be considered as a typical Milky Way habitable system because it migrated outwards from the metal-rich inner regions of the Disk and has a circular orbit in the present epoch. We conclude that the boundaries of the Galactic Habitable Zone cannot be sharply confined for a given epoch because of the mixing caused by the stellar migrations and secular evolution of stellar orbits.

 - **Abstract**
 In cosmology, the quest for primordial $B$-modes in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations has highlighted the critical need for a refined model of the Galactic dust foreground. We investigate diffusion-based modeling of the dust foreground and its interest for component separation. Under the assumption of a Gaussian CMB with known cosmology (or covariance matrix), we show that diffusion models can be trained on examples of dust emission maps such that their sampling process directly coincides with posterior sampling in the context of component separation. We illustrate this on simulated mixtures of dust emission and CMB. We show that common summary statistics (power spectrum, Minkowski functionals) of the components are well recovered by this process. We also introduce a model conditioned by the CMB cosmology that outperforms models trained using a single cosmology on component separation. Such a model will be used in future work for diffusion-based cosmological inference.
#### Discovery of a proto-white dwarf with a massive unseen companion

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of SDSS~J022932.28+713002.7, a nascent extremely low-mass (ELM) white dwarf (WD) orbiting a massive ($> 1\,M_\odot$ at 2$\sigma$ confidence) companion with a period of 36 hours. We use a combination of spectroscopy, including data from the ongoing SDSS-V survey, and photometry to measure the stellar parameters for the primary pre-ELM white dwarf. The lightcurve of the primary WD exhibits ellipsoidal variation, which we combine with radial velocity data and $\tt{PHOEBE}$ binary simulations to estimate the mass of the invisible companion. We find that the primary WD has mass $M_1$ = $0.18^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ M$_\odot$ and the unseen secondary has mass $M_2$ = $1.19^{+0.21}_{-0.14}$ M$_\odot$. The mass of the companion suggests that it is most likely a near-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf or a neutron star. It is likely that the system recently went through a Roche lobe overflow from the visible primary onto the invisible secondary. The dynamical configuration of the binary is consistent with the theoretical evolutionary tracks for such objects, and the primary is currently in its contraction phase. The measured orbital period puts this system on a stable evolutionary path which, within a few Gyrs, will lead to a contracted ELM white dwarf orbiting a massive compact companion.
#### Neuromorphic cameras for Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes and fast  optical astronomy: new paradigm, challenges and opportunities

 - **Abstract**
 The astronomy community has witnessed an explosive growth in the use of deep-learning techniques based on neural networks since the mid-2010s. The widespread adoption of these nature-inspired technologies has helped astronomers tackle previously insurmountable problems and provided an unprecedented opportunity for new discoveries. However, one of the primary tools of today's optical astronomy is neither natural nor efficient: their photo-sensing devices. Specifically, the modern CCD camera - like that of the cutting-edge Rubin Observatory - requires an internal clock to regularly expose the sensor to light, consumes a large amount of energy and information bandwidth, and has a limited dynamic range. On the contrary, biological eyes lack an internal clock and a shutter, have much higher pixel density but consume significantly less energy and bandwidth, and can adapt to bright and low light conditions. Inspired by the nature of the eyes, M. Mahowald and C. Mead introduced the revolutionary concept of a silicon retina sensor in 1991. Also known as event-based cameras (EBCs), these types of devices operate in a vastly different way compared to conventional CCD-based imaging sensors. EBCs mimic the operating principles of optic nerves and continuously produce a stream of events, with each event generated only when a pixel detects a change in light intensity. EBCs do not have fixed exposure times, have high dynamic range, require low power for operation, and can capture high-speed phenomena. These properties are important requirements for Cherenkov telescopes as well as other high-speed optical astronomy. This work presents the opportunities and challenges of using EBCs in those cases, and proposes a low-cost approach to experimentally assess the feasibility of this innovative technique.
#### Discovery of spin-phase dependent QPOs in the super-critical accretion  regime from the X-ray pulsar RX J0440.9+4431

 - **Abstract**
 RX J0440.9+4431 is an accreting X-ray pulsar (XRP) that remained relatively unexplored until recently, when major X-ray outburst activity enabled more in-depth studies. Here, we report on the discovery of ${\sim}0.2$ Hz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) from this source observed with $Fermi$-GBM. The appearance of QPOs in RX J0440.9+4431 is thricely transient, that is, QPOs appear only above a certain luminosity, only at certain pulse phases (namely corresponding to the peak of its sine-like pulse profile), and only for a few oscillations at time. We argue that this newly discovered phenomenon (appearance of thricely transient QPOs -- or ATTO) occurs if QPOs are fed through an accretion disk whose inner region viscosity is unstable to mass accretion rate and temperature variations. Such variations are triggered when the source switches to the super-critical accretion regime and the emission pattern changes. We also argue that the emission region configuration is likely responsible for the observed QPOs spin-phase dependence.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, several major pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have assembled strong evidence for the existence of a gravitational-wave background at frequencies around the nanohertz regime. Assuming that the PTA signal is attributed to scalar-induced gravitational waves, we jointly employ the PTA data from the NANOGrav 15-year data set, PPTA DR3, and EPTA DR2 to probe the conditions of the early Universe. Specifically, we explore the equation of state parameter ($w$), the sound speed ($c_s$), and the reheating temperature ($T_\mathrm{rh}$), finding $w=0.60^{+0.32}_{-0.39}$, $c_s\gtrsim 0.09$, and $T_\mathrm{rh}\lesssim 0.2\,\mathrm{GeV}$ for a lognormal power spectrum of the curvature perturbation. Furthermore, we compute Bayes factors to compare different models against the radiation domination model ($c_s^2 = w = 1/3$), effectively excluding the pressure-less fluid domination model. Our study underscores the significance of scalar-induced gravitational waves as a powerful tool to explore the nature of the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we present the European Low Frequency Survey (ELFS), a project that will enable foregrounds-free measurements of primordial $B$-mode polarization to a level 10$^{-3}$ by measuring the Galactic and extra-Galactic emissions in the 5--120\,GHz frequency window. Indeed, the main difficulty in measuring the B-mode polarization comes not just from its sheer faintness, but from the fact that many other objects in the Universe also emit polarized microwaves, which mask the faint CMB signal. The first stage of this project will be carried out in synergy with the Simons Array (SA) collaboration, installing a 5.5--11 GHz coherent receiver at the focus of one of the three 3.5\,m SA telescopes in Atacama, Chile ("ELFS on SA"). The receiver will be equipped with a fully digital back-end based on the latest Xilinx RF System-on-Chip devices that will provide frequency resolution of 1\,MHz across the whole observing band, allowing us to clean the scientific signal from unwanted radio frequency interference, particularly from low-Earth orbit satellite mega-constellations. This paper reviews the scientific motivation for ELFS and its instrumental characteristics, and provides an update on the development of ELFS on SA.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, using the latest Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and observational Hubble data (OHD), we carry out a joint constraint on the Hubble constant $H_0$, the spatial curvature $\Omega_{\rm K}$, and the sound horizon at the end of drag epoch $r_{\rm d}$. To be model-independent, four cosmography models, i.e., the Taylor series in terms of redshift $y_1=z/(1+z)$, $y_2=\arctan(z)$, $y_3=\ln(1+z)$, and the Pad\'e approximants, are used without the assumption of flat Universe. The results show that the $H_0$ is anti-correlated with $\Omega_{\rm K}$ and $r_{\rm d}$, indicating smaller $\Omega_{\rm K}$ or $r_{\rm d}$ would be helpful in alleviating the Hubble tension. And the values of $H_0$ and $r_{\rm d}$ are consistent with the estimate derived from the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data based on the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, but $H_0$ is in 2.3$\sim$3.0$\sigma$ tension with that obtained by \cite{Riess2022} in all these cosmographic approaches. Meanwhile, a flat Universe is preferred by the present observations under all approximations except the third order of $y_1$ and $y_2$ of the Taylor series. Furthermore, according to the values of the Bayesian evidence, we found that the flat $\Lambda$CDM remains to be the most favored model by the joint datasets, and the Pad\'e approximant of order (2,2), the third order of $y_3$ and $y_1$ are the top three cosmographic expansions that fit the datasets best, while the Taylor series in terms of $y_2$ are essentially ruled out.
#### NIKA2 observations of dust grain evolution from star-forming filament to  T-Tauri disk: Preliminary results from NIKA2 observations of the Taurus  B211/B213 filament

 - **Abstract**
 To understand the evolution of dust properties in molecular clouds in the course of the star formation process, we constrain the changes in the dust emissivity index from star-forming filaments to prestellar and protostellar cores to T Tauri stars. Using the NIKA2 continuum camera on the IRAM 30~m telescope, we observed the Taurus B211/B213 filament at 1.2\,mm and 2\,mm with unprecedented sensitivity and used the resulting maps to derive the dust emissivity index $\beta$. Our sample of 105 objects detected in the $\beta$ map of the B211/B213 filament indicates that, overall, $\beta$ decreases from filament and prestellar cores ($\beta \sim 2\pm0.5$) to protostellar cores ($\beta \sim 1.2 \pm 0.2$) to T-Tauri protoplanetary disk ($\beta < 1$). The averaged dust emissivity index $\beta$ across the B211/B213 filament exhibits a flat ($\beta \sim 2\pm0.3$) profile. This may imply that dust grain sizes are rather homogeneous in the filament, start to grow significantly in size only after the onset of the gravitational contraction/collapse of prestellar cores to protostars, reaching big sizes in T Tauri protoplanetary disks. This evolution from the parent filament to T-Tauri disks happens on a timescale of about 1-2~Myr.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the finite velocity of the ejecta of a type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in the double detonation (DDet) scenario with a white dwarf (WD) mass-donor companion, and find that the runaway velocity of the surviving (mass donor) WD is lower than its pre-explosion orbital velocity by about 8-11 %. This implies that the fastest runaway WDs in the Galaxy, if come from the DDet scenario, require even more massive WDs than what a simple calculation that neglects the finite ejecta velocity gives. This extreme set of initial conditions makes such binaries less common. We also tentatively find that the inner ejecta largely deviate from spherical symmetry, unlike observed SN Ia remnants. We argue that these findings support the claim that the DDet scenario leads mostly to peculiar SNe Ia but not to normal SNe Ia.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first test of coasting cosmological models with gravitational-wave standard sirens observed in the first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network. We apply the statistical galaxy catalog method adapted to coasting cosmologies and infer constraints on the $H_0$ Hubble constant for the three fixed values of the curvature parameter $k=\left\{ -1,0,+1 \right\}$ in $H_0^2 c^{-2}$ units. The maximum posteriors and $68.3\%$ highest density intervals we obtained from a combined analysis of $46$ dark siren detections and a single bright siren detection are $H_0=\left\{68.1^{+8.5}_{-5.6},67.5^{+8.3}_{-5.2},67.1^{+6.6}_{-5.8} \right\}~\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$, respectively. All our constraints on $H_0$ are consistent within one sigma with the latest measurement of $H_0$ applying the differential age method, which provides a constraint on $H_0$ in coasting cosmologies independently from $k$. Our results constrain all cosmological models with $a(t)\propto t$ linear expansion in the luminosity distance and redshift range of the $47$ LIGO-Virgo detections, i.e. $d_\mathrm{L}\lesssim 5~\mathrm{Gpc}$ and $z\lesssim 0.8$, which practically include all (both strictly linear and quasi-linear) models in the coasting model family. As we have found, the coasting models and the $\Lambda$CDM model fit equally well to the applied set of gravitational-wave detections.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring the electron diffusion coefficient is the most straightforward task in the study of gamma-ray pulsar halos. The updated measurements of the spatial morphology and spectrum of the Geminga halo by the HAWC experiment enable us to constrain parameters beyond the diffusion coefficient, including the size of the slow-diffusion zone and the electron injection spectrum from the pulsar wind nebulae (PWN). Based on the two-zone diffusion model, we find that the slow-diffusion zone size ($r_*$) around Geminga is within the range of $30-70$pc. The lower boundary of this range is determined by the goodness of fit of the model to the one-dimensional morphology of the Geminga halo. The upper limit is derived from fitting the gamma-ray spectrum of the Geminga halo, along with the expectations for the power-law index of the injection spectrum based on simulations and PWN observations, i.e., $p\gtrsim1$. With $r_*$ set at its lower limit of $30$~pc, we obtain the maximum $p$ permitted by the HAWC spectrum measurement, with an upper limit of $2.17$ at a $3\sigma$ significance. Moreover, we find that when $r_*=30$pc and $p=2.17$, the predicted positron spectrum generated by Geminga at Earth coincides with the AMS-02 measurement in the $50-500$GeV range.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of the investigation of the nova V1674 Her (2021), recognised as the swiftest classical nova, with $t_2 \sim 0.90$ days. The distance to the nova is estimated to be 4.97 kpc. The mass and radius of the WD are calculated to be $\sim~1.36~M_\odot$ and $\sim 0.15~R_\oplus$, respectively. Over the course of one month following the outburst, V1674 Her traversed distinct phases -- pre-maxima, early decline, nebular, and coronal -- displaying a remarkably swift transformation. The nebular lines emerged on day 10.00, making it the classical nova with the earliest observed commencement to date. We modelled the observed optical spectrum using the photoionization code \textsc{cloudy}. From the best-fitting model we deduced different physical and chemical parameters associated withe the system. The temperature and luminosity of the central ionizing sources are found in the range of $1.99 - 2.34~\times 10^5$ K and $1.26 - 3.16~ \times 10^{38}$ \ergs, respectively. Elements such as He, O, N, and Ne are found to be overabundant compared to solar abundance in both the nebular and coronal phases. According to the model, Fe II abundance diminishes while Ne abundance increases, potentially elucidating the rare hybrid transition between Fe and He/N nova classes. The ejected mass across all epochs spanned from $3.42 - 7.04~ \times 10^{-5}~M_\odot$. Morpho-kinematic modelling utilising \textsc{shape} revealed that the nova V1674 Her possesses a bipolar structure with an equatorial ring at the centre and an inclination angle of i = 67$\pm$ 1.5$^{\circ}$.

 - **Abstract**
 At the beginning of the year 2020, MAGIC reported a very-high-energy (VHE) flaring activity from the FSRQ QSO B1420+326. It is now the fourth known most distant blazar (z=0.682) with an observed VHE gamma-ray emission. In this work, we investigate the effect of photon-axion-like particle (ALP) oscillations in the gamma-ray spectra measured by Fermi-LAT and MAGIC around the flaring state. We set 95% confidence level (C.L.) upper limit on the ALP parameters and obtain a constraint on the photon-ALP coupling constant $g_{a\gamma} < 2\times10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for ALP masses $m_{a} \sim 10^{-10}-10^{-9}$ eV. Assuming the hadronic origin of VHE photons, we also estimate the expected neutrino flux from this source and the contribution to diffuse neutrino flux from QSO B1420+326-like FSRQs at sub-PeV energies. Furthermore, we study the implications of photon-ALP oscillations on the counterpart $\gamma$-rays of the sub-PeV neutrinos. Finally, we investigate a viable scenario of invisible neutrino decay to ALPs on the gamma-ray spectra and diffuse $\gamma$-ray flux at sub-PeV energies. Interestingly, we find that for the choice of neutrino lifetime $\tau_{2}/m_{2} = 10^3$ s eV$^{-1}$, the $\gamma$-ray flux has a good observational sensitivity towards LHAASO-KM2A.
#### Why does inflation look single field to us?

 - **Abstract**
 Most high-energy constructions that realise a phase of cosmic inflation contain many degrees of freedom. Yet, cosmological observations are all consistent with single-field embeddings. We show how volume selection effects explain this apparent paradox. Due to quantum diffusion, different regions of space inflate by different amounts. In regions that inflate most, and eventually dominate the volume of the universe, a generic mechanism is unveiled that diverts the inflationary dynamics towards single-field attractors. The formalism of constrained stochastic inflation is developed to this end.

 - **Abstract**
 Peptide-like molecule, which has a close connection with the origin of life, has been detected in universe. Mapping observations of HCONH$_2$ and CH$_3$CONH$_2$, two simplest peptide-like molecules, are performed towards Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2) complex with the IRAM 30m telescope. Seven transitions of HCONH$_2$ and five transitions of CH$_3$CONH$_2$ are used in analysis. The spatial distribution of excitation temperature and column density of HCONH$_2$ in the molecular envelope of Sgr B2 are obtained by the rotation diagrams. Assuming the same excitation temperature as HCONH$_2$, the column densities of CH$_3$CONH$_2$ are also calculated. The results show that excitation temperature ranges from 6 K to 46 K in the molecular envelope of Sgr B2. The abundance ratio between HCONH$_2$ and CH$_3$CONH$_2$ are calculated to explore the relationship among them, as well as HNCO mentioned in our pervious research. The abundance ratio of CH$_3$CONH$_2$/HCONH$_2$ varies from 10% to 20%, while that of HCONH$_2$/HNCO ranges from 1.5% to 10%. CH$_3$CONH$_2$ is enhanced with respect to HCONH$_2$ in the northwest region of Sgr B2. One transition of H$^{13}$CONH$_2$ is detected toward 12 positions of Sgr B2, from which a $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of 28.7 is obtained. A time-dependent chemical model with a short duration of X-ray burst is used to explain the observed abundances of HCONH$_2$ and CH$_3$CONH$_2$, with the best fitting result at T$\rm_{dust}$ = 53-56 K. More chemical reactions are required to be included into the model since the modeled abundance is lower than the observed one at the observed T$\rm_{dust}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Since 2018, the potential for a high-energy neutrino telescope, named the Pacific Ocean Neutrino Experiment (P-ONE), has been thoroughly examined by two pathfinder missions, STRAW and STRAW-b, short for short for Strings for Absorption Length in Water. The P-ONE project seeks to install a neutrino detector with a one cubic kilometer volume in the Cascadia Basin's deep marine surroundings, situated near the western shores of Vancouver Island, Canada. To assess the environmental conditions and feasibility of constructing a neutrino detector of that scale, the pathfinder missions, STRAW and STRAW-b, have been deployed at a depth of 2.7 km within the designated site for P-ONE and were connected to the NEPTUNE observatory, operated by Ocean Networks Canada (ONC). While STRAW focused on analyzing the optical properties of water in the Cascadia Basin, \ac{strawb} employed cameras and spectrometers to investigate the characteristics of bioluminescence in the deep-sea environment. This report introduces the STRAW-b concept, covering its scientific objectives and the instrumentation used. Furthermore, it discusses the design considerations implemented to guarantee a secure and dependable deployment process of STRAW-b. Additionally, it showcases the data collected by battery-powered loggers, which monitored the mechanical stress on the equipment throughout the deployment. The report also offers an overview of STRAW-b's operation, with a specific emphasis on the notable advancements achieved in the data acquisition (DAQ) system and its successful integration with the server infrastructure of ONC.

 - **Abstract**
 We use a carefully selected subsample of 1053 confirmed exoplanets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive to construct empirical power-law exoplanet mass-radius-temperature ($M$-$R$-$T$) relations. Using orthogonal distance regression to account for errors in both mass and radius, we allow the data to decide: 1) the number of distinct planetary regimes; 2) whether the boundaries of these regimes are best described by broken power laws joined at mass break points, or by discontinuous power laws motivated by changes in equations of state and temperature. We find strong support from the data for three distinct planetary $M$-$R$ regimes and for those regimes to be discontinuous. Our most successful model involves an $M$-$R$-$T$ relation in which ice/rock (rocky) and ice-giant (neptunian) planets are segregated by a pure-ice equation of state, whilst neptunes and gas giant (jovian) planets are segregated by a mass break at $M_{\rm br} = 115\pm19~M_{\oplus}$. The rocky planet regime is shown to follow $M \propto R^{0.34\pm0.01}$, whilst neptunes have $M\propto R^{0.55\pm0.02}$. Planets in both regimes are seen to extend to similar maximum masses. In the jovian regime, we find that $M \propto R^{0.00\pm0.01}T^{0.35\pm 0.02}$, where $T$ is the planet equilibrium temperature. This implies that, for jovian planets detected so far, equilibrium temperature alone provides a robust estimator of mass.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution solar spectroscopy provides a wealth of information from photospheric and chromospheric spectral lines. However, the volume of data easily exceeds hundreds of millions of spectra on a single observation day. Therefore, methods are needed to identify spectral signatures of interest in multidimensional datasets. Background-subtracted activity maps (BaSAMs) have previously been used to locate features of solar activity in time series of images and filtergrams. This research note shows how this method can be extended and adapted to spectral data.

 - **Abstract**
 Inflation is a highly favoured theory for the early Universe. It is compatible with current observations of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure and is a driver in the quest to detect primordial gravitational waves. It is also, given the current quality of the data, highly under-determined with a large number of candidate implementations. We use a new method in symbolic regression to generate all possible simple scalar field potentials for one of two possible basis sets of operators. Treating these as single-field, slow-roll inflationary models we then score them with an information-theoretic metric ("minimum description length") that quantifies their efficiency in compressing the information in the Planck data. We explore two possible priors on the parameter space of potentials, one related to the functions' structural complexity and one that uses a Katz back-off language model to prefer functions that may be theoretically motivated. This enables us to identify the inflaton potentials that optimally balance simplicity with accuracy at explaining the Planck data, which may subsequently find theoretical motivation. Our exploratory study opens the door to extraction of fundamental physics directly from data, and may be augmented with more refined theoretical priors in the quest for a complete understanding of the early Universe.
#### Can acoustic early dark energy still resolve the Hubble tension?

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we re-assess the ability of the acoustic early dark energy (ADE) model to resolve the Hubble tension in light of the new Pantheon+ and S$H_0$ES data on the one hand, and the BOSS LRG and eBOSS QSO data, analysed under the effective field theory of large-scale structures (ETFofLSS) on the other hand. We find that the Pantheon+ data, which favor a larger $\Omega_m$ value than the Pantheon data, have a strong constraining power on the ADE model, while the EFTofLSS analysis of the BOSS and eBOSS data only slightly increases the constraints. We establish that the ADE model is now ruled out as a solution to the Hubble tension, with a remaining tension of $3.6\sigma$. In addition, we find that the axion-like early dark energy model performs better when confronted to the same datasets, with a residual tension of $2.5\sigma$. This work shows that the Pantheon+ data can have a decisive impact on models which aim to resolve the Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we examine the list of 63 candidates to T Tauri star (TTS) in the TAMC identified by their ultraviolet (UV) and infrared colours (IR) measured from data obtained by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer all sky survey (GALEX-AIS) and the Two Microns All Sky Survey (2MASS), respectively. The objective of this work is twofold: evaluate whether they are pre-main sequence (PMS) stars and evaluate the goodness of the UV-IR colour-colour diagram to detect PMS stars in wide-fields. The astrometric properties of these sources have been retrieved from the Gaia DR3 catalogue and used to evaluate their membership probability. Several classification algorithms have been tested to search for the kinematical groups but the final classification has been made with k-means++ algorithms. Membership probability has been evaluated by applying Logistic Regression. In addition, spectroscopic information available in the archive of the Large Sky Area Multi Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope has been used to ascertain their PMS nature when available. About 20% of the candidates share the kinematics of the TAMC members. Among them, HD 281691 is a G8-type field star located in front of the cloud and HO Aur is likely a halo star given the very low metallicity provided by Gaia. The rest are three known PMS stars (HD 30171, V600 Aur and J04590305+3003004), two previously unknown accreting M-type stars (J04510713+1708468 and J05240794+2542438) and, five additional sources, which are very likely PMS stars. Most of these new sources are concentrated at low galactic latitudes over the Auriga-Perseus region.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent decades, the use of optical detection systems for meteor studies has increased dramatically, resulting in huge amounts of data being analyzed. Automated meteor detection tools are essential for studying the continuous meteoroid incoming flux, recovering fresh meteorites, and achieving a better understanding of our Solar System. Concerning meteor detection, distinguishing false positives between meteor and non-meteor images has traditionally been performed by hand, which is significantly time-consuming. To address this issue, we developed a fully automated pipeline that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify candidate meteor detections. Our new method is able to detect meteors even in images that contain static elements such as clouds, the Moon, and buildings. To accurately locate the meteor within each frame, we employ the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique. This method facilitates the identification of the region of interest by multiplying the activations from the last convolutional layer with the average of the gradients across the feature map of that layer. By combining these findings with the activation map derived from the first convolutional layer, we effectively pinpoint the most probable pixel location of the meteor. We trained and evaluated our model on a large dataset collected by the Spanish Meteor Network (SPMN) and achieved a precision of 98\%. Our new methodology presented here has the potential to reduce the workload of meteor scientists and station operators and improve the accuracy of meteor tracking and classification.
