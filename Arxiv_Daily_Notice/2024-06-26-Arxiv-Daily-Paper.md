 - **Abstract**
 We propose a multi-mode bar consisting of mass elements of decreasing size for the direct detection of stimulated absorption of up to kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger and post-merger. We find that the multi-mode detector has normal modes that retain the coupling strength to the gravitational wave of the largest mass-element, while only having an effective mass comparable to the mass of the smallest element. This allows the normal modes to have graviton absorption rates due to the tonne-scale largest mass, while the single graviton absorption process in the normal mode could be resolved through energy measurements of a mass-element in-principle smaller than pico-gram scale. This improves the transduction of the single-graviton signal compared to a single-mode detector, enhancing the feasibility of detecting single gravitons.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic 21 cm signal serves as a crucial probe for studying the evolutionary history of the Universe. However, detecting the 21 cm signal poses significant challenges due to its extremely faint nature. To mitigate the interference from the Earth's radio frequency interference (RFI), the ground and the ionospheric effects, the Discovering the Sky at the Longest Wavelength (DSL) project will deploy a constellation of satellites in Lunar orbit, with its high-frequency daughter satellite tasked with detecting the global 21 cm signal from cosmic dawn and reionization era (CD/EoR). We intend to employ the Vari-Zeroth-Order Polynomial (VZOP) for foreground fitting and subtracting. We have studied the effect of thermal noise, thermal radiation from the Moon, the Lunar reflection, anisotropic frequency-dependent beam, inaccurate antenna beam pattern, and RFI contamination. We discovered that the RFI contamination can significantly affect the fitting process and thus prevent us from detecting the signal. Therefore, experimenting on the far side of the moon is crucial. We also discovered that using VZOP together with DSL, after 1080 orbits around the Moon, which takes about 103 days, we can successfully detect the CD/EoR 21 cm signal.

 - **Abstract**
 The statistics of Einstein radii for a sample of strong lenses can provide valuable constraints on the underlying mass distribution. The correct interpretation, however, relies critically on the modelling of the selection of the sample, which has proven to be a limiting factor. This may change thanks to upcoming uniform high-resolution imaging surveys that cover a large fraction of the sky, because they can provide complete lens samples, with well understood selection criteria. To explore how the observed distribution of Einstein radii depends on the galaxy properties, we simulated a realistic complete sample of strong lenses, predicting a number density of lenses of about 2.5 deg$^{-2}$ for a \Euclid-like setup. Such data can break the degeneracy between the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the inner slope of the density profile of dark matter, without having to rely on additional information from stellar dynamics. We found that a survey covering only 50 deg$^2$ can already provide tight constraints: assuming that the cosmology is known, the dark matter slope is recovered with an uncertainty of $3.5\%$, while the uncertainty in the ratio between the true stellar mass and that inferred from stellar population modelling was found to be $10\%$. These findings highlight the potential of this method when applied to samples of lenses with well-understood selection functions.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are repeated X-ray flares from galactic nuclei. Despite some diversity in the recurrence and amplitude of eruptions, their striking regularity has motivated theorists to associate QPEs with orbital systems. Among the known QPE sources, eRO-QPE2 has shown the most regular flare timing and luminosity since its discovery. We report here on its long-term evolution over $\sim3.3\,$yr from discovery and find that: i) the average QPE recurrence time per epoch has decreased over time, albeit not at a uniform rate; ii) the distinct alternation between consecutive long and short recurrence times found at discovery has not been significant since; iii) the spectral properties, namely flux and temperature of both eruptions and quiescence components, have remained remarkably consistent within uncertainties. We attempted to interpret these results as orbital period and eccentricity decay coupled with orbital and disk precession. However, since gaps between observations are too long, we are not able to distinguish between an evolution dominated by just a decreasing trend, or by large modulations (e.g. due to the precession frequencies at play). In the former case, the observed period decrease is roughly consistent with that of a star losing orbital energy due to hydrodynamic gas drag from disk collisions, although the related eccentricity decay is too fast and additional modulations have to contribute too. In the latter case, no conclusive remarks are possible on the orbital evolution and the nature of the orbiter due to the many effects at play. However, these two cases come with distinctive predictions for future X-ray data: in the former, we expect all future observations to show a shorter recurrence time than the latest epoch, while in the latter we expect some future observations to be found with a larger recurrence, hence an apparent temporary period increase.

          The Relation Between Variances of a 3D Density and Its 2D Column Density Revisited

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the relation between the variance of three-dimensional (3D) density ($\sigma^{2}_{\rho}$) and that of the projected two-dimensional (2D) column density ($\sigma^{2}_{\Sigma}$) in turbulent media, which is of great importance in obtaining turbulence properties from observations. Earlier studies showed that $\sigma^{2}_{\Sigma / \Sigma_{0}}/\sigma^{2}_{\rho / \rho_{0}} = \mathcal{R}$, where $\Sigma/\Sigma_0$ and $\rho/\rho_0$ are 2D column and 3D volume densities normalized by their mean values, respectively. The factor $\mathcal{R}$ depends only on the density spectrum for isotropic turbulence in a cloud that has similar dimensions along and perpendicular to the line of sight. Our major findings in this paper are as follows. First, we show that the factor $\mathcal{R}$ can be expressed in terms of $N$, the number of independent eddies along the line of sight. To be specific, $\sigma^{2}_{\Sigma / \Sigma_{0}}/\sigma^{2}_{\rho/\rho_{0}}$ is proportional to $\sim 1/N$, due to the averaging effect arising from independent eddies along the line of sight. Second, we show that the factor $\mathcal{R}$ needs to be modified if the dimension of the cloud in the line-of-sight direction is different from that in the perpendicular direction. However, if we express $\sigma^{2}_{\Sigma / \Sigma_{0}}/\sigma^{2}_{\rho / \rho_{0}}$ in terms of $N$, the expression remains same even in the case the cloud has different dimensions along and perpendicular to the line of sight. Third, when we plot $N\sigma^{2}_{\Sigma / \Sigma_{0}}$ against $\sigma^{2}_{\rho / \rho_{0}}$, two quantities roughly lie on a single curve regardless of the sonic Mach number, which implies that we can directly obtain the latter from the former. We discuss observational implications of our findings.

          Time Non-locality in Dark Matter and LSS

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the intriguing phenomenon of time non-locality in the evolution of dark matter and Large Scale Structure (LSS). Recently in\,\cite{Donath:2023sav}, it was shown that time non-locality emerges in bias tracer fluctuations, which are $SO(3)$ scalars in real space, at fifth order in the perturbation expansion in dark matter overdensity. We demonstrate that by breaking the symmetry down to $SO(2)$, which is the case whenever line-of-sight effects become important, such as for flux fluctuations in the Lyman $\alpha$ forest, the temporal non-locality appears at the third order in expansion. Additionally, within the framework of EFTofLSS, we demonstrate that time non-locality manifests in the effective stress tensor of dark matter, which is a second rank tensor under $SO(3)$ transformations, again at the third order in dark matter overdensity. Furthermore, we highlight the effectiveness of the standard $\Pi$ basis\,\cite{Mirbabayi:2014zca} in handling time non-local operators.

          The true nature of HE0057-5959, the most metal-poor Li-rich star

 - **Abstract**
 The Li-rich stars are a class of rare objects with A(Li) higher than that of other stars in the same evolutionary stage. Their origin is still debated and valuable routes are the Cameron-Fowler mechanism, mass transfer process in a binary system or engulfment of small bodies. Metal-poor ([Fe/H]<-1 dex) stars are only a small fraction of the entire population of Li-rich stars. We observed with MIKE at the Magellan Telescope the metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-3.95+-0.11 dex) giant star HE0057-5959, deriving A(Li)=+2.09+-0.07 dex. Such A(Li) is higher by about 1 dex than that of other stars in the same evolutionary stage. A previous analysis of the same target suggested that its high A(Li) reflects a still ongoing First Dredge-Up process. We revise the nature of HE0057-5959 by comparing its stellar parameters and A(Li) with appropriate stellar evolution models. This comparison rules out that HE0057-5959 is caught during its First Dredge-Up, being this latter already ended according to the parameters of this star. Its A(Li), remarkably higher than the typical lithium plateau drawn by similar giant stars, demonstrates that HE0057-5959 joins the class of the rare metal-poor Li-rich stars. HE0057-5959 is the most metal-poor Li-rich star discovered so far. We consider different scenarios to explain this star. No internal mixing able to activate the Cameron-Fowler mechanism is known for metal-poor stars at this evolutionary stage. Also the engulfment of planets is disfavored because such metal-poor stars should not host planets. Finally, HE0057-5959 is one of the most Na-rich among the Li-rich stars and we found that a strong excess of Na is common to the three Li-rich stars with [Fe/H]<-3 dex. This finding could support the scenario of mass transfer from a massive companion star in a binary system, even if we found no evidence of radial velocity variations.

          Caustic area biases and how to deal with them

 - **Abstract**
 Quadruply-imaged strongly lensed quasars (quads) are routinely used for measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe with time delays. It has recently been suggested that any quad lens is subject to a Malmquist-like bias that causes the inferred area enclosed within the tangential caustic to be systematically underestimated, and that such a bias might translate into a corresponding bias on the expansion parameter. In this work we extended that analysis by also considering the effect of Eddington bias. We found that the sign and amplitude of the combined bias depend on the functional form of the caustic area distribution of the lens population and on the noise associated with the caustic area estimation process. Based on simulations, we estimated that the corresponding impact on $H_0$ is on the order of a percent or smaller. If the likelihood of the lensing data is known, then the bias can be accounted for when modelling the lens population. However, ignoring the criteria used to select a quad might lead to a bias at the lens modelling stage that causes the inferred caustic area to be overestimated. Such a bias disappears for lens models that are well constrained by the data.

          A New Gravitational Wave Probe to the Nature of Dark Energy from the Aging of the Universe: Can Future Detectors Achieve it?

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most dominant energy budget of the Universe is Dark Energy, which remains enigmatic since the claim of its existence from the observation of late-time cosmic acceleration. We propose a new way of inferring this by measuring the aging of the Universe using only gravitational wave (GW) signals from coalescing binary compact objects of any masses. We show that the aging of the Universe will lead to a change in the observed chirp mass of the GW sources inferred from different stages of its coalesces by monitoring a coherent source from two far-apart GW frequencies for a few years. We show that coordinated GW detectors which can reach a relative uncertainty on chirp mass measurement of about $10^{-9}$, can measure a tiny departure of about $2\%$ from the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0=-1$ and its variation with cosmic time by using stellar origin binary black holes up to redshift $z=5$ in 10 years of observation time without using any external calibrator. If the next generation of GW detectors can achieve this precision, then it can open a new window to discover the fundamental nature of dark energy.

          Revisiting evolution of domain walls and their gravitational radiation with CosmoLattice

 - **Abstract**
 Employing the publicly available CosmoLattice code, we conduct numerical simulations of a domain wall network and the resulting gravitational waves (GWs) in a radiation-dominated Universe in the $Z_2$-symmetric scalar field model. In particular, the domain wall evolution is investigated in detail both before and after reaching the scaling regime, using the combination of numerical and theoretical methods. We demonstrate that the total area of closed walls is negligible compared to that of a single long wall stretching throughout the simulation box. Therefore, the closed walls are unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall network evolution. This is in contrast with the case of cosmic strings, where formation of loops is crucial for maintaining the system in the scaling regime. To obtain the GW spectrum, we develop a technique that separates physical effects from numerical artefacts arising due to finite box size and non-zero lattice spacing. Our results on the GW spectrum agree well with Refs. [29, 30], which use different codes. Notably, we observe a peak at the Hubble scale, an exponential falloff at scales shorter than the wall width, and a plateau/bump at intermediate scales. We also study sensitivity of obtained results on the choice of initial conditions. We find that different types of initial conditions lead to qualitatively similar domain wall evolution in the scaling regime, but with important variations translating into different intensities of GWs.

 - **Abstract**
 The ionisation cones of NGC5728 have a deficit of molecular gas based on millimetre observations of CO(2-1) emission. Although photoionisation from the active nucleus may lead to suppression of this transition, warm molecular gas can still be present. We report the detection of eight mid-infrared rotational H$_2$ lines throughout the central kiloparsec, including the ionisation cones, using integral field spectroscopic observations with JWST/MIRI MRS. The H$_2$ line ratios, characteristic of a power-law temperature distribution, indicate that the gas is warmest where it enters the ionisation cone through disk rotation, suggestive of shock excitation. In the nucleus, where the data can be combined with an additional seven ro-vibrational H$_2$ transitions, we find that moderate velocity (30 km s$^{-1}$) shocks in dense ($10^5$ cm$^{-3}$) gas, irradiated by an external UV field ($G_0 = 10^3$), do provide a good match to the full set. The warm molecular gas in the ionisation cone that is traced by the H$_2$ rotational lines has been heated to temperatures $>200$ K. Outside of the ionisation cone the molecular gas kinematics are undisturbed. However, within the ionisation cone, the kinematics are substantially perturbed, indicative of a radial flow, but one that is quantitatively different from the ionised lines. We argue that this outflow is in the plane of the disk, implying a short 50 pc acceleration zone up to speeds of about 400 km s$^{-1}$ followed by an extended deceleration over $\sim$700 pc where it terminates. The deceleration is due to both the radially increasing galaxy mass, and mass-loading as ambient gas in the disk is swept up.

          Forming Massive Terrestrial Satellites through Binary-Exchange Capture

 - **Abstract**
 The number of planetary satellites around solid objects in the inner Solar System is small either because they are difficult or unlikely to form, or that they do not survive for astronomical timescales. Here we conduct a pilot study on the possibility of satellite capture from the process of collision-less binary-exchange and show that massive satellites in the range 0.01 - 0.1 Earth masses can be captured by earth-sized terrestrial planets in a way already demonstrated for larger planets both in the Solar System and possibly beyond. In this process, one of the binary objects is ejected, leaving the other object as a satellite in orbit around the planet. We specifically consider satellite capture by an earth in an assortment of hypothetical encounters with large terrestrial binaries at 1 AU around the Sun. In addition, we examine the tidal evolution of captured objects and show that orbit circularization and long-term stability are possible for cases resembling the Earth-Moon system.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Pulsars have a very stable rotation. However, sudden increases in their rotation frequency known as glitches, perturb their evolution. While large glitches are commonly detected, small glitches are harder to detect because of the lack of daily-cadence observations over long periods of time. Aims. We aim to explore the timing behaviour of young pulsars at daily timescales looking for small glitches and other irregularities. This will further our comprehension of the distribution of glitch sizes, which has also consequences for the theoretical modeling of the glitch mechanism. Methods. We observed six pulsars with up to daily cadence during 5 years with the antennas of the Argentine Institute of Radio Astronomy (IAR). We used standard pulsar timing tools to characterise the rotation of pulsars and developed an algorithm to look for small timing events in the data and calculate the changes in $\nu$ and $\dot\nu$ at those epochs. Results. We found that the rotation of pulsars in this dataset is affected by small step changes in $\nu$ and $\dot\nu$. We found three glitches that had not been reported before: two in PSR J1048-5832 with relative sizes $\Delta\nu / \nu= 9.1(4) \times 10^{-10}$ and $\Delta\nu / \nu = 4.5(1) \times 10^{-10}$, and one in the Vela pulsar with a size $\Delta\nu / \nu = 2.0(2) \times 10^{-10}$. We also report new decay terms on the 2021 Vela giant glitch, and on the 2022 giant glitches in PSR J0742-2822 and PSR J1740-3015 respectively. Besides, we found that the red noise contribution significantly diminished in PSR J0742-2822 after its giant glitch in 2022. Conclusions. Our results highlight the importance of high-cadence monitoring with an exhaustive analysis of the residuals to better characterize the distribution of glitch sizes and to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms behind glitches, red noise and timing irregularities.

          Detection of a Highly Ionized Outflow in the Quasi-periodically Erupting Source GSN 069

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are high-amplitude, soft X-ray bursts recurring every few hours, associated with supermassive black holes. Many interpretations for QPEs were proposed since their recent discovery in 2019, including extreme mass ratio inspirals and accretion disk instabilities. But, as of today, their nature still remains debated. We perform the first high-resolution X-ray spectral study of a QPE source using the RGS gratings onboard XMM-Newton, leveraging nearly 2 Ms of exposure on GSN 069, the first discovered source of this class. We resolve several absorption and emission lines including a strong line pair near the N VII rest-frame energy, resembling the P-Cygni profile. We apply photoionization spectral models and identify the absorption lines as an outflow blueshifted by $1700-2900$ km/s, with a column density of about $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and an ionization parameter $\log (\xi$/erg cm s$^{-1})$ of $3.9-4.6$. The emission lines are instead redshifted by up to 2900 km/s, and likely originate from the same outflow that imprints the absorption features, and covers the full $4\pi$ sky from the point of view of GSN 069. The column density and ionization are comparable to the outflows detected in some tidal disruption events, but this outflow is significantly faster and has a strong emission component. The outflow is more highly ionized when the system is in the phase during which QPEs are present, and from the limits we derive on its location, we conclude that the outflow is connected to the recent complex, transient activity of GSN 069 which began around 2010.

 - **Abstract**
 Hard X-ray-emitting ($\delta$-type) symbiotic binaries, which exhibit a strong hard X-ray excess, have posed a challenge to our understanding of accretion physics in degenerate dwarfs. RT Cru, which is a member of $\delta$-type symbiotics, shows stochastic X-ray variability. Timing analyses of X-ray observations from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR, which we consider here, indicate hourly fluctuations, in addition to a spectral transition from 2007 to a harder state in 2012 seen with Suzaku observations. To trace the nature of X-ray variability, we analyze the multi-mission X-ray data using principal component analysis (PCA), which determines the spectral components mostly contributing to the flickering behavior and the hardness transition. The Chandra HRC-S/LETG and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data provide the primary PCA components, which may contain some variable emission features, especially in the soft excess. Additionally, the absorbing column (first order with 50%), along with the source continuum (20%), and a third component (9%) - which likely accounts for thermal emission in the soft band - are the three principal components found in the Suzaku XIS1 observations. The PCA components of the NuSTAR data also correspond to the continuum and possibly emission features. Our findings suggest that the spectral hardness transition between the two Suzaku observations is mainly due to changes in the absorbing material and X-ray continuum, while some changes in the thermal plasma emission may result in flickering-type variations.

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars, like pulsars, have led to major advances in many areas of astronomy and physics. The discovery in 2023 of a cosmological gravitational wave (GW) stochastic background using millisecond pulsar timing arrays has focused attention on the importance of millisecond pulsars, to both multi-messenger astronomy and cosmology, and for identifying the origin of the GW stochastic background, which is hypothesized to be due to supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). Unlike pulsars, however, for which the details of the discovery are well-known, those of millisecond pulsars are not well known. In particular, the details of the first crucial step in the discovery of millisecond pulsars, namely the discovery of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) in the radio source 4C 21.53, are known only to the author. This article presents a first-hand account of this crucial first step, which resulted ultimately in the discovery of millisecond pulses from this object. A brief description of interplanetary and interstellar scintillation and scattering is given in the Appendix.

 - **Abstract**
 RF-ICE is a signal processing platform for the readout of large arrays of superconducting resonators. Designed for flexibility, the system's low digital latency and ability to independently and dynamically set the frequency and amplitude of probe tones in real time has enabled previously-inaccessible views of resonator behaviour, and opened the door to novel resonator control schemes. We introduce a multi-frequency imaging technique, developed with RF-ICE, which allows simultaneous observation of the entire resonance bandwidth. We demonstrate the use of this technique in the examination of the response of superconducting resonators to variations in applied readout current and thermal loading. We observe that, used in conjunction with a conventional frequency sweep at sufficiently large amplitude to induce resonance bifurcation, the multi-frequency imaging technique reveals a resonator response which is not captured by the frequency sweep measurement alone. We demonstrate that equivalent resonant frequency shifts can be achieved using either thermal, optical, or readout loading, and use this equivalence to counteract a change in thermal loading by digitally modulating the readout current through a resonator. We develop and implement a proof-of-concept closed-loop negative electro-quasiparticle feedback algorithm which first sets and then maintains the resonant frequency of a lumped element kinetic inductance detector while the loading on it is varied. Although this simple implementation is not yet suitable to deploy at scale, it demonstrates the utility of this feedback technique to improve linearity while addressing amplifier distortion, resonator response non-uniformity, and crosstalk. It can be applied to kinetic inductors in non-bolometric operation, and sets the stage for future developments.

 - **Abstract**
 The Submillimeter Array (SMA) is an array of 8 antennas operating at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths on Maunakea, Hawaii, operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Taiwan. Over the past several years, we have been preparing a major upgrade to the SMA that will replace the aging original receiver cryostats and receiver cartridges with all new cryostats and new 230 and 345 GHz receiver designs. This wideband upgrade (wSMA) will also include significantly increased instantaneous bandwidth, improved sensitivity, and greater capabilities for dual frequency observations. In this paper, we will describe the wSMA receiver upgrade and status, as well as the future upgrades that will be enabled by the deployment of the wSMA receivers.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery that blazars dominate the extra-galactic {\gamma}-ray sky is a triumph in the Fermi era. However, the exact location of {\gamma}-ray emission region still remains in debate. Low-synchrotron-peaked blazars (LSPs) are estimated to produce high-energy radiation through the external Compton process, thus their emission regions are closely related to the external photon fields. We employed the seed factor approach proposed by Georganopoulos et al. It directly matches the observed seed factor of each LSP with the characteristic seed factors of external photon fields to locate the {\gamma}-ray emission region. A sample of 1138 LSPs with peak frequencies and peak luminosities was adopted to plot a histogram distribution of observed seed factors. We also collected some spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of historical flare states to investigate the variation of {\gamma}-ray emission region. Those SEDs were fitted by both quadratic and cubic functions using the Markov-chain Monte Carlo method. Furthermore, we derived some physical parameters of blazars and compared them with the constraint of internal {\gamma}{\gamma}-absorption. We find that dusty torus dominates the soft photon fields of LSPs and most {\gamma}-ray emission regions of LSPs are located at 1-10 pc. The soft photon fields could also transition from dusty torus to broad line region and cosmic microwave background in different flare states. Our results suggest that the cubic function is better than the quadratic function to fit the SEDs.

 - **Abstract**
 With the number of supernovae observed expected to drastically increase thanks to large-scale surveys like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), it is necessary that the tools we use to classify these objects keep up with this increase. We previously created Supernova Tagging and Classification (STag) to address this problem by employing machine learning techniques alongside logistic regression in order to assign 'tags' to spectra based on spectral features. STag II is a continuation of this work, which now makes use of model supernova spectra combined with real DESI spectra in order to train STag to better deal with realistic data. We also make use of the rlap score as a trustworthiness cut, making for a more robust and accurate supernova classifier than before.

 - **Abstract**
 The calculation of the emerging radiation from a model atmosphere requires knowledge of the emissivity and absorption coefficients, which are proportional to the atomic level population densities of the levels involved in each transition. Due to the intricate interdependency of the radiation field and the physical state of the atoms, iterative methods are required in order to calculate the atomic level population densities. A variety of different methods have been proposed to solve this problem, which is known as the Non-Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium (NLTE) problem. In this study we have developed a Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov method (JFNK) to solve multi-level NLTE radiative transfer problems. Using the Rybicki & Hummer (1992) method as a reference (Rybicki, G. B. & Hummer, D. G. 1992, A&A, 262, 209), our results show that our JFNK solver can achieve up to a factor two speed up when using local approximate operators / preconditioners, while also achieving a lower residual error in the statistical equilibrium equations. Another advantage of this method is that the addition of charge conservation and partial redistribution effects should be straight forward. Our method can help accelerating the calculation of the emerging spectra from numerical models and also the reconstruction of chromospheric datasets through NLTE inversions.

 - **Abstract**
 This review summarizes popular unsupervised learning methods, and gives an overview of their past, current, and future uses in astronomy. Unsupervised learning aims to organise the information content of a dataset, in such a way that knowledge can be extracted. Traditionally this has been achieved through dimensionality reduction techniques that aid the ranking of a dataset, for example through principal component analysis or by using auto-encoders, or simpler visualisation of a high dimensional space, for example through the use of a self organising map. Other desirable properties of unsupervised learning include the identification of clusters, i.e. groups of similar objects, which has traditionally been achieved by the k-means algorithm and more recently through density-based clustering such as HDBSCAN. More recently, complex frameworks have emerged, that chain together dimensionality reduction and clustering methods. However, no dataset is fully unknown. Thus, nowadays a lot of research has been directed towards self-supervised and semi-supervised methods that stand to gain from both supervised and unsupervised learning.

 - **Abstract**
 We report two binary systems, LAMOST J035540+381550 (hereafter J035540) and LAMOST J035916+400732 (hereafter J035916), identified through the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) low-resolution survey (LRS). Each of these two systems contains an M-type star orbiting with a invisible compact object candidate. Follow-up spectroscopic observations of Palomar 200-inch telescope (P200) enhance radial velocity measurements. We use radial velocities from LAMOST and P200, as well as light curves from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to constrain orbital parameters. The masses of the visible M-type stars are estimated by fitting the MIST isochrones and SEDs. The mass functions for the unseen companions are: $0.22\pm 0.01 M_{\odot}$ for J035540 and $0.16\pm 0.01 M_{\odot}$ for J035916. With the orbital and stellar parameters derived above and assuming the orbital inclination is 90 degree (edge-on), we find that the minimum masses of the invisible companions exceeds that of the visible stars. The single-lined feature and the dynamical evidence suggest the presence of compact objects. J035540's ZTF light curve, modeled with PHOEBE, yields a compact object mass of $0.70^{+0.12}_{-0.05} M_{\odot}$. For J035916, ellipsoidal modulation analysis constrains the light curve amplitude, yielding a compact object mass range of $0.57-0.90 M_{\odot}$. The mass estimates indicate that both are likely white dwarfs. These findings underscore the efficiency of optical time-domain surveys and dynamical methods in identifying faint, massive white dwarfs, along with other compact objects in binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 We present proper motion (PM) measurements for a sample of 23 massive star clusters within the Large Magellanic Cloud using multi-epoch data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We combined archival data from the ACS/WFC and WFC3/UVIS instruments with observations from a dedicated HST programme, resulting in time baselines between 4.7 and 18.2 yr available for PM determinations. For bright well-measured stars, we achieved nominal PM precisions of 55 $\mu$as/yr down to 11 $\mu$as/yr . To demonstrate the potential and limitations of our PM data set, we analysed the cluster NGC 1850 and showcase a selection of different science applications. The precision of the PM measurements allows us to disentangle the kinematics of the various stellar populations that are present in the HST field. The cluster has a centre-of-mass motion that is different from the surrounding old field stars and also differs from the mean motion of a close-by group of very young stars. We determined the velocity dispersion of field stars to be 0.128 +/- 0.003 mas/yr (corresponding to 30.3 +/- 0.7 km/s). The velocity dispersion of the cluster inferred from the PM data set most probably overestimates the true value, suggesting that the precision of the measurements at this stage is not sufficient for a reliable analysis of the internal kinematics of extra-galactic star clusters. Finally, we exploit the PM-cleaned catalogue of likely cluster members to determine any radial segregation between fast and slowly-rotating stars, finding that the former are more centrally concentrated. With this paper, we also release the astro-photometric catalogues for each cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational wave (GW) signal from binary black hole (BBH) mergers is a promising probe of Population III (Pop III) stars. To fully unleash the power of the GW probe, one important step is to understand the relative importance and features of different BBH evolution channels. We model two channels, isolated binary stellar evolution (IBSE) and nuclear star cluster-dynamical hardening (NSC-DH), in one theoretical framework based on the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH, under various assumptions on Pop III initial mass function (IMF), initial binary statistics and high-$z$ nuclear star clusters (NSCs). The NSC-DH channel contributes $\sim 8-95\%$ of Pop III BBH mergers across cosmic history, with higher contributions achieved by initially wider binary stars, more top-heavy IMFs, and more abundant high-$z$ NSCs. The dimensionless stochastic GW background (SGWB) produced by Pop III BBH mergers has peak values $\Omega^{\rm peak}_{\rm GW}\sim 10^{-11}-8\times 10^{-11}$ around observer-frame frequencies $\nu\sim 10-100\ \rm Hz$. The Pop III contribution can be a non-negligible ($\sim 2-32\%$) component in the total SGWB at $\nu\lesssim 10\ \rm Hz$. The estimated detection rates of Pop III BBH mergers by the Einstein Telescope are $\sim 6-230\ \rm yr^{-1}$ and $\sim 30-1230\ \rm yr^{-1}$ for the NSC-DH and IBSE channels, respectively. Pop III BBH mergers in NSCs are more massive than those from IBSE, so they dominate the Pop III SGWB below $20$ Hz in most cases. Besides, the detection rate of Pop III BBH mergers involving at least one intermediate-mass BH above $100\ \rm M_\odot$ by the Einstein Telescope is $\sim 0.5-200\ \rm yr^{-1}$ in NSCs but remains below $0.1\ \rm yr^{-1}$ for IBSE.

 - **Abstract**
 At optical/ultraviolet energies, blazars display an underlying thermal (unpolarized) contribution from the accretion disc, torus and line emitting regions, diluting the polarized emission from the jet-component. Optical polarimetry can be used to disentangle the thermal and non-thermal components, and place constraints on the particle populations and acceleration mechanisms responsible for the non-thermal emission. We present the results of a linear optical spectropolarimetric observing campaign of 18 blazars (6 BLLs and 12 FSRQs) undertaken with the Southern African Large Telescope between 2016 and 2022. This was done to observe these systems during flaring states, as well as long term monitoring of PKS1510-089, AP Lib and PKS 1034-293. The observations traced the frequency dependence of the degree and angle of polarization, as well as changes in the spectral line strengths. We investigated possible correlations between the polarization and other observed characteristics for the sources. While an indication of correlation was found between the frequency dependence and the average level of polarization for some sources, a correlation was not found for the population as a whole. These results highlight that continuous observations and in-depth modelling of polarization and its frequency dependence is required to obtain a more holistic view of TeV blazars.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnant (SNR) detection along the Galactic plane poses a number of challenges. The SNR G309.8+00.0 lies exactly on the Galactic plane, with its center coinciding with galactic latitude (b)=0 deg. In this paper we report the first detection of the SNR G309.8+00.0 in X-rays and $\gamma$ rays, using stacked data from the first four consecutive extended ROentgen Survey Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) -- on board the Russian-German Spektrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) -- all-sky surveys (eRASS:4) and $\sim15.5$ yr of Pass 8 data recorded from Fermi-LAT, respectively. The SNR appears to have an elliptical shape of 0.43 x 0.32 deg in size in both radio synchrotron and X-ray data. The SNR's emission exhibits a shell-like morphology and good spatial correlation in both energy bands. The X-ray emission was solely detected in the 1-2 keV energy band (subject to strong absorption at soft X-rays) and the spectral analysis results of eRASS:4 data present a purely thermal SNR with a high absorption column density $3.1_{-0.5}^{+0.7}\cdot10^{22}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ and a temperature of $0.34\pm0.1$ keV. In combination with optical extinction data, the absorption column density values derived from the remnant's spectral analysis support a remnant's distance greater than 6 kpc, rather than a 3.12 kpc distance as reported in the literature, and yield an age of $1-3.5\cdot10^5$ yr. Employing $\sim15.5$ yr of Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray data at and around the remnant's vicinity, we confirm the detection of the to-date unidentified 4FGL J1349.5-6206c source that can either be modeled as a single source or a conglomerate of multiple distinct source components and we argue that the SNR G309.8+00.0 likely represents at least a significant portion (if not all) of the emission from the 4FGL J1349.5-6206c $\gamma$-ray source.

 - **Abstract**
 The merger of compact binary stars produces short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), involving channels such as neutron star - neutron star (BNS) and neutron star - black hole (NS-BH). The association between sGRB 170817A and gravitational wave GW 170817 provides reliable evidence for the BNS channel. The spatial distribution and merger rate differ between BNS mergers and NS-BH mergers. Some speculations suggest that sGRBs with extended emission (EE) may represent another distinct population. We compared the offset distributions of these two types of samples and found that they follow the same distribution. Utilizing non-parametric methods, we investigated the origin of these burst types in terms of their formation rate. We examined the luminosity function and formation rate of sGRBs without assuming any specific model.The luminosity function can be described as $\psi(L_{0}) \propto L_{0}^{-0.09 \pm 0.01}$ for $L_{0} < L_0^b$ for standard sGRBs and $\psi(L_{0}) \propto L_{0}^{-0.09 \pm 0.01}$ for $L_{0} < L_0^b$ for sGRBs with EE. The formation rate is characterized as $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-4.21 \pm 0.22}$ for $z < 0.8$ and $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-0.22 \pm 0.47}$ for $0.8 < z < 3$ for standard sGRBs, while for sGRBs with EE, it is $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-4.30 \pm 0.13}$ for $z < 0.8$ and $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-0.33 \pm 0.66}$ for $0.8 < z < 3$. Based on these findings, we suggest that there is no significant difference in the progenitor stars of sGRBs with and without EE, considering the spatial offset and formation rate perspectives.

 - **Abstract**
 The imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique provides potentially the highest angular resolution achievable in astronomy at energies above the X-ray waveband. High-resolution measurements provide the key to progress on many of the major questions in high-energy astrophysics, including the sites of particle acceleration to PeV energies. The potential of the next-generation CTA observatory in this regard can be realised with the help of improved algorithms for the reconstruction of the air-shower direction and energy. Hybrid methods combining likelihood-fitting techniques with neural networks represent a particularly promising approach and have recently been applied to the reconstruction of astrophysical neutrinos. Here, we present the FreePACT algorithm, a hybrid reconstruction method for IACTs. In this, making use of the neural ratio estimation technique from the field of likelihood-free inference, the analytical likelihood used in traditional image likelihood fitting is replaced by a neural network that approximates the charge probability density function for each pixel in the camera. The performance of this algorithm is demonstrated using simulations of the planned CTA southern array. For this setup, FreePACT provides significant performance improvements over analytical likelihood techniques, with improvements in angular and energy resolution of 25% or more over a wide energy range and an angular resolution as low as 40 arcseconds at energies above 50 TeV for observations at 20 degrees zenith angle. It also yields more accurate estimations of the uncertainties on the reconstructed parameters and speeds up the reconstruction compared to analytical likelihood techniques while showing the same stability with respect to changes in the observation conditions. Therefore, the FreePACT method is a promising upgrade over the current state-of-the-art likelihood event reconstruction techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomical observatories have been identified as substantial contributors to the carbon footprint of astrophysical research. Being part of the collaboration that currently develops the Medium-Sized Telescope (MST) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array, a ground-based observatory for very-high-energy gamma rays that will comprise 64 telescopes deployed on two sites, we assessed the environmental impacts of one MST on the Northern site by means of a Life Cycle Assessment. We identified resource use and climate change as the most significant impacts, being driven by telescope manufacturing and energy consumption during operations. We estimate life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of 2,660 +/- 274 tCO2 equivalent for the telescope, 44% of which arise from construction, 1% from on-site assembly and commissioning, and 55% from operations over 30 years. Environmental impacts can be reduced by using renewable energies during construction and operations, use of less electronic components and metal casting, and use of recycled materials. We propose complementing project requirements with environmental budgets as an effective measure for impact management and reductions.

 - **Abstract**
 CO$_2$ is a major component of the icy mantles surrounding dust grains in planet and star formation regions. Understanding its photodesorption is crucial for explaining gas phase abundances in the coldest environments of the interstellar medium irradiated by vacuum-UV (VUV) photons. Photodesorption yields determined experimentally from CO$_2$ samples grown at low temperatures (T=15~K) have been found to be very sensitive to experimental methods and conditions. Several mechanisms have been suggested for explaining the desorption of CO$_2$, O$_2$ and CO from CO$_2$ ices. In the present study, the cross sections characterizing the dynamics of photodesorption as a function of photon fluence (determined from released molecules in the gas phase) and of ice composition modification (determined in situ in the solid phase) are compared for the first time for different photon flux conditions (from 7.3$\times 10^{12}$~photon/s/cm$^2$ to 2.2$\times 10^{14}$~photon/s/cm$^2$) using monochromatic synchrotron radiation in the VUV range (on the DESIRS beamline at SOLEIL). This approach reveals that CO and O$_2$ desorption are decorrelated from that of CO$_2$. CO and O$_2$ photodesorption yields depend on photon flux conditions and can be linked to surface chemistry. By contrast, the phodesorption yield of CO$_2$ is independent of the photon flux conditions and can be linked to bulk ice chemical modification, consistently with an indirect desorption induced by electronic transition (DIET) process.

 - **Abstract**
 For the first time, in March 2024, the transient Galactic black hole candidate Swift J151857.0-572147 experienced an outburst. Using publicly available archived {\it Insight}-HXMT data, we analyze the timing and spectral features of this source. Through model fitting of the power density spectrum, we were able to extract the properties of quasi-periodic oscillations, and based on those properties, we have determined that the QPOs are of type C. We also conclude that the shock instabilities in the transonic advective accretion processes surrounding black holes may be the source of the QPOs. This shock instability could produce variabilities of flux up to 48 keV, as we checked from the QPO energy dependence. High-frequency QPO is not observed during this period. In the broad energy band of $2-100$ keV, simultaneous data from the three on-board instruments of \textit{Insight}-HXMT were used to perform the spectral analysis. A combination of models, including broken power-law, multi-color disk-blackbody continuum, interstellar absorption, and reflection in both neutral and ionized medium were needed for spectral fitting to obtain the best fit. We discovered that at the beginning of the analysis period, the source was in an intermediate state and was transitioning toward the softer states based on the spectral features. It has a hydrogen column density of $(4.3-6.9) \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$.

 - **Abstract**
 SPHERE, operating at the VLT since 2014, is currently one of the high-contrast instruments with a higher performance. Its adaptive optics system, known as SAXO, will be upgraded to SAXO+, which features the addition of a second stage of adaptive optics. This stage will use a near-infrared pyramid wavefront sensor to record images of fainter exoplanets around redder stars. In this work, we compare the performance of SAXO and SAXO+. We look for the optimal values of the key system parameters of SAXO+ for various science cases and turbulence conditions. We performed numerical simulations using COMPASS, an end-to-end adaptive optics simulation tool. We simulated perfect coronagraph images of an on-axis point source, and we minimized the residual starlight intensity between 3 and 5 ${\lambda}/D$ as a performance criterion. The explored parameter space includes science cases, turbulence conditions, and key system parameters. In every science case and turbulence condition, SAXO+ reduces the residual starlight intensity inside the correction zone of the second stage by a factor of ten compared to SAXO. The optimal first stage gain is lower for SAXO+ than for SAXO alone. We quantified the gain in performance of SAXO+ when changing the second stage frequency from 2 kHz to 3 kHz, and we conclude that 2 kHz may be sufficient for most realistic conditions. We give the optimal first stage gain as well as the first and second stage frequencies for every seeing, coherence time, and science case. Finally, we find that a 2 ${\lambda_{\mathrm{WFS}}}/D$ pyramid modulation radius is a good trade-off between performance and robustness against varying turbulence conditions. This study shows that the future SAXO+ system will outperform the current SAXO system in all studied cases.

 - **Abstract**
 Small planets ($R_{p} \leq 4 R_{\oplus}$) are divided into rocky super-Earths and gaseous sub-Neptunes separated by a radius gap, but the mechanisms that produce these distinct planet populations remain unclear. Binary stars are the only main-sequence systems with an observable record of the protoplanetary disk lifetime and mass reservoir, and the demographics of planets in binaries may provide insights into planet formation and evolution. To investigate the radius distribution of planets in binary star systems, we observed 207 binary systems hosting 283 confirmed and candidate transiting planets detected by the Kepler mission, then recharacterized the planets while accounting for the observational biases introduced by the secondary star. We found that the population of planets in close binaries ($\rho \leq 100$ au) is significantly different from the planet population in wider binaries ($\rho > 300$ au) or single stars. In contrast to planets around single stars, planets in close binaries appear to have a unimodal radius distribution with a peak near the expected super-Earth peak of $R_{p} \sim 1.3 R_{\oplus}$ and a suppressed population of sub-Neptunes. We conclude that we are observing the direct impact of a reduced disk lifetime, smaller mass reservoir, and possible altered distribution of solids reducing the sub-Neptune formation efficiency. Our results demonstrate the power of binary stars as a laboratory for exploring planet formation and as a controlled experiment of the impact of varied initial conditions on mature planet populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Both the stellar activity and the accretion processes of young stellar objects can induce variations in their radial velocity (RV). This variation is often modulated on the stellar rotation period and may hide a RV signal from a planetary or even a stellar companion. Aims. The aim of this study is to detect the companion of HQ Tau, the existence of which is suspected based on our previous study of this object. We also aim to derive the orbital elements of the system. Methods. We used multi-variate Gaussian process regression on the RV and the bisector inverse slope of a six-month high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up observation of the system to model the stellar activity. This allowed us to extract the Keplerian RV modulation induced by the suspected companion. Results. Our analysis yields the detection of a $\sim$50 M$_{\rm jup}$ brown dwarf companion orbiting HQ Tau with a $\sim$126 day orbital period. Although this is consistent with the modulation seen on this dataset, it does not fit the measurements from our previous work three years earlier. In order to include these measurements in our analysis, we hypothesise the presence of a third component with orbital elements that are consistent with those of the secondary according to our previous analysis (M$_{\rm B}$ $\sim$48 M$_{\rm jup}$, P$_{\rm orb,B}$ $\sim$126 days), and a $\sim$465 M$_{\rm jup}$ tertiary with a $\sim$767 day orbital period. However, the hypothesis of a single companion with M$_{\rm B}$ $\sim$188 M$_{\rm jup}$ and P$_{\rm orb}$ $\sim$247 days can fit both datasets and cannot be completely excluded at this stage of the analysis. Conclusions. At minima, HQ Tau is a single-lined spectroscopic binary, and several factors indicate that the companion is a brown dwarf and that a third component is responsible for larger RV variation on a longer timescale.

 - **Abstract**
 In our previous study, we introduced a machine-learning technique, namely CMBFSCNN, for the removal of foreground contamination in cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization data. This method was successfully employed on actual observational data from the Planck mission. In this study, we extend our investigation by considering the CMB lensing effect in simulated data and utilizing the CMBFSCNN approach to recover the CMB lensing B-mode power spectrum from multi-frequency observational maps. Our method is first applied to simulated data with the performance of CMB-S4 experiment. We achieve reliable recovery of the noisy CMB Q (or U) maps with a mean absolute difference of $0.016\pm0.008\ \mu$K (or $0.021\pm0.002\ \mu$K) for the CMB-S4 experiment. To address the residual instrumental noise in the foreground-cleaned map, we employ a "half-split maps" approach, where the entire dataset is divided into two segments sharing the same sky signal but having uncorrelated noise. Using cross-correlation techniques between two recovered half-split maps, we effectively reduce instrumental noise effects at the power spectrum level. As a result, we achieve precise recovery of the CMB EE and lensing B-mode power spectra. Furthermore, we also extend our pipeline to full-sky simulated data with the performance of LiteBIRD experiment. As expected, various foregrounds are cleanly removed from the foreground contamination observational maps, and recovered EE and lensing B-mode power spectra exhibit excellent agreement with the true results. Finally, we discuss the dependency of our method on the foreground models.

 - **Abstract**
 The North-South asymmetry in the number density and bulk velocity of stars in the solar neighborhood provides valuable insights into the formation and evolution of the Milky Way disk. Our objective is to investigate the wave-like disk oscillations of mono-age stellar populations in the Solar neighbourhood using data from Gaia Data Release 3. We have selected a comprehensive sample of main sequence turn off stars. The ages of these stars can be accurately determined using isochrone fitting methods. Our findings indicate that the north-south density and mean vertical velocity asymmetries remain consistent across all age groups.The uniformity of perturbations across all subsamples suggests that all populations are responding to the same external influence, which likely affects them irrespective of their age. Moreover, the fact that these perturbations appear consistently implies they could be either ongoing or recent. Regarding vertical velocity dispersions, we observe that older stars exhibit larger dispersions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the design and validation of a variable temperature cryogenic blackbody source, hereinafter called a cold load, that will be used to characterize detectors to be deployed by CMB-S4, the next-generation ground-based cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment. Although cold loads have been used for detector characterization by previous CMB experiments, this cold load has three novel design features: (1) the ability to operate from the 1 K stage of a dilution refrigerator (DR), (2) a 3He gas-gap heat switch to reduce cooling time, and (3) the ability to couple small external optical signals to measure detector optical time constants under low optical loading. The efficacy of this design was validated using a 150 GHz detector array previously deployed by the Spider experiment. Thermal tests showed that the cold load can be heated to temperatures required for characterizing CMB-S4's detectors without significantly impacting the temperatures of other cryogenic stages when mounted to the DR's 1 K stage. Additionally, optical tests demonstrated that external signals can be coupled to a detector array through the cold load without imparting a significant optical load on the detectors, which will enable measurements of the CMB-S4 detectors' optical time constants.

 - **Abstract**
 The neutrino signal from the next galactic core-collapse supernova will provide an invaluable early warning of the explosion. By combining the burst trigger from several neutrino detectors, the location of the explosion can be triangulated minutes to hours before the optical emission becomes visible, while also reducing the rate of false-positive triggers. To enable multi-messenger follow-up of nearby supernovae, the SuperNova Early Warning System 2.0 (SNEWS 2.0) will produce a combined alert using a global network of neutrino detectors. This paper describes the trigger publishing and alert formation framework of the SNEWS 2.0 network. The framework is built on the HOPSKOTCH publish-subscribe system to easily incorporate new detectors into the network, and it implements a coincidence system to form alerts and estimate a false-positive rate for the combined triggers. The paper outlines the structure of the SNEWS 2.0 software and the initial testing of coincident signals.

          The compact circumstellar material of SN 2024ggi: Another supernova with a pre-explosion effervescent zone and jet-driven explosion

 - **Abstract**
 I examine recent theoretical studies and observations of the recent core-collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 20224ggi and find that the likely explanation for its dense, compact circumstellar material is an effervescent model, where parcels or streams of gas are uplifted by stellar convection and pulsation and fall back. The effervescent zone exists alongside the regular wind from the red supergiant (RSG) progenitor of SN 2024ggi. I find that an extended wind-acceleration zone encounters some difficulties in accounting for the required CSM mass. Recent modelling finds the explosion energy of SN 2024ggi to be >1e51 erg and up to 2e51 erg. I examine this explosion energy against a recent study of the delayed neutrino explosion mechanism and find that this mechanism has difficulties in accounting for the required energy. This suggests that the explosion was caused by the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM), adding to other recent pieces of evidence supporting the JJEM, particularly point-symmetric CCSN remnants.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, spectral, age, kinematic, and orbital dynamical analyses were conducted on metal-poor and high proper-motion (HPM) stars, HD 8724 and HD 195633, selected from the Solar neighborhood. This analysis combines detailed abundance measurements, kinematics, and orbital dynamics to determine their origin. Standard 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis provides a fresh determination of the atmospheric parameters: $T_{\rm eff}=$4700$\pm$115 K, $\log g=$ 1.65$\pm$0.32 cgs, [Fe/H]=-1.59$\pm$0.04 dex, and a microturbulent velocity $\xi=$ 1.58$\pm$0.50 km s$^{\rm -1}$ for HD 8724 and $T_{\rm eff}=$6100$\pm$205 K, $\log g=$3.95$\pm$0.35 cgs, [Fe/H]=-0.52$\pm$0.05 dex, and $\xi=$1.26$\pm$0.50 km s$^{\rm -1}$ for HD 195633. The ages were estimated using a Bayesian approach (12.25 Gyr for HD 8724 and 8.15 Gyr for HD 195633). The escape scenarios of these stars from 170 candidate globular clusters (GCs) in the Galaxy were also investigated because of their chemical and physical differences (HPM and metal-poor nature). Accordingly, the calculated probability of encounter ($59\%$) for HD 8724 at a distance of five tidal radius suggests that star HD 8724 may have escaped from NGC 5139 ($\omega$ Cen), supported by its highly flattened orbit and may belong to a sub-population of this GC. Conversely, HD 195633's kinematics, age, and metal abundances point towards an escape from the bulge GC NGC 6356.
