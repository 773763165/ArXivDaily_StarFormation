 - **Abstract**
 This paper provides a comprehensive guide to gravitational wave data processing, with a particular focus on signal generation, noise modeling, and optimization techniques. Beginning with an introduction to gravitational waves and the detection techniques used by LIGO and Virgo, the manual covers the essentials of signal processing, including Fourier analysis, filtering, and the generation of quadratic chirp signals. The analysis of colored Gaussian noise and its impact on interferometric detectors like LIGO is explored in detail, alongside signal detection methods such as the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT). The paper also delves into optimization techniques like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which can be applied to improve signal estimation accuracy. By providing MATLAB-based implementations, this manual serves as both a theoretical and practical resource for researchers in the field of gravitational wave astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 The hydrogen recombination lines H30$\alpha$, H40$\alpha$, H42$\alpha$, H50$\beta$ and H57$\gamma$ and the underlying bremsstrahlung continuum emission were detected with ALMA in the bipolar nebula Mz3. The source was not spatially resolved, but the velocity profile of the H30$\alpha$ line shows clear indication of maser amplification, confirming previous reports of laser amplification in the far infrared H recombination lines observed with Herschel Space Observatory. Comparison between the flux densities of the H50$\beta$, H40$\alpha$ and H42$\alpha$ lines show overcooling, or darkness amplification by stimulated absorption (dasar effect) at the LSR velocity of about $-25$ km s$^{-1}$, which constrains the density of the absorbing region to about 10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$. The H30$\alpha$ line, on the other hand, presents maser lines at LSR velocities of $-69$ and $-98$ km s$^{-1}$, which indicates ionized gas with densities close to 10$^7$ cm$^{-3}$. Although the source of emission was not resolved, it was possible to find the central position of the images for each velocity interval, which resulted in a well defined position-velocity distribution.

          Metal pollution in Sun-like stars from destruction of ultra-short-period planets

 - **Abstract**
 Chemical evidence indicates that an appreciable fraction of Sun-like stars have engulfed rocky planets during their main-sequence lifetimes. We investigate whether the tidal evolution and destruction of ultra-short-period planets (USPs) can explain this phenomenon. We develop a simple parameterized model for the formation and engulfment of USPs in a population of MS stars. With this model, it is possible to reproduce both the observed occurrence rate of USPs and the frequency of planet-engulfing Sun-like stars for a reasonable range of USP formation rates and tidal decay lifetimes. Our results support a theory of USP formation through gradual inward migration over many Gyr and suggest that engulfment occurs $\sim 0.1$-$1 \, {\rm Gyr}$ after formation. This lifetime is set by tidal dissipation in the USP itself instead of the host star, due to the perturbing influence of external companions. If USP engulfment is the main source of pollution among Sun-like stars, we predict a correlation between pollution and compact multi-planet systems; some $5$-$10\%$ of polluted stars should have a transiting planet of mass $\gtrsim 5 M_{\oplus}$ and period $\sim 4$-$12$ days.

          SCExAO/CHARIS Near-Infrared Scattered-Light Imaging and Integral Field Spectropolarimetry of the AB Aurigae Protoplanetary System

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze near-infrared integral field spectropolarimetry of the AB Aurigae protoplanetary disk and protoplanet (AB Aur b), obtained with SCExAO/CHARIS in 22 wavelength channels covering the J, H, and K passbands ($\lambda_{\rm o}$ = 1.1--2.4 $\mu m$) over angular separations of $\rho$ $\approx$ 0.13" to 1.1" ($\sim$20--175 au). Our images resolve spiral structures in the disk in each CHARIS channel. At the longest wavelengths, the data may reveal an extension of the western spiral seen in previous polarimetric data at $\rho$ $<$ 0.3" out to larger distances clockwise from the protoplanet AB Aur b, coincident with the ALMA-detected $CO$ gas spiral. While AB Aur b is detectable in complementary total intensity data, it is a non-detection in polarized light at $\lambda$ $>$ 1.3 $\mu $m. While the observed disk color is extremely red across $JHK$, the disk has a blue intrinsic scattering color consistent with small dust grains. The disk's polarization spectrum is redder than AB Aur b's total intensity spectrum. The polarization fraction peaks at $\sim$ 0.6 along the major disk axis. Radiative transfer modeling of the CHARIS data shows that small, porous dust grains with a porosity of $p$ = 0.6--0.8 better reproduce the scattered-light appearance of the disk than more compact spheres ($p$ = 0.3), especially the polarization fraction. This work demonstrates the utility of integral field spectropolarimetry to characterize structures in protoplanetary disks and elucidate the properties of the disks' dust.

          Inflationary and Gravitational Wave Signatures of Small Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter

 - **Abstract**
 Mounting evidence suggests that the semi-classical description of a black hole breaks down at the latest after losing an O(1) fraction of its mass. As a result, effects such as memory burden can slow down evaporation so that small primordial black holes (PBHs), in particular those in the mass range 10^6 g to 10^9 g, become viable dark matter candidates. In this paper, we investigate the production of PBHs from a prototype model of polynomial inflation with a non-minimal coupling to gravity. We show that a sufficiently small PBH mass alleviates any tension with CMB observations. Moreover, we develop efficient numerical procedures to identify model parameters and evolve Mukhanov-Sasaki modes to place bounds on the scalar-induced stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Whilst we identify some prospects for observation with future GW detectors, our results highlight the need to develop new experiments for high-frequency GW detection in the ~kHz to ~MHz range. Finally, we demonstrate that previously-used ansätze for modelling the power spectrum only yield a reliable approximation for the GW signal if some input from inflation is used.

          A semi-analytic estimate for the effective sound speed counterterm in the EFTofLSS

 - **Abstract**
 The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) has found tremendous success as a perturbative framework for the evolution of large scale structure, and it is now routinely used to compare theoretical predictions against cosmological observations. The model for the total matter field includes one nuisance parameter at 1-loop order, the effective sound speed, which can be extracted by matching the EFT to full N-body simulations. In this work we first leverage the Layzer-Irvine cosmic energy equation to show that the equation of state can be exactly computed with knowledge of the fully nonlinear power spectrum. When augmented with separate universe methods, we show one can estimate the effective sound speed. This estimate is in good agreement with simulation results, with errors at the few tens of percent level. We apply our method to investigate the cosmology dependence of the effective sound speed and to shed light on what cosmic structures shape its value.

          Cracking the relation between mass and 1P-star fraction of globular clusters: II. The masses in 1P and 2P stars as a second tool

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic globular clusters contain two main groups of stars, the pristine or 1P stars, and the polluted or 2P stars. The pristine-star fraction in clusters, $F_{1P}$, is a decreasing function of the cluster present-day mass, $m_{prst}$. Paper~I has introduced a model mapping the region of the $(m_{prst},F_{1P})$ space occupied by clusters, with the cluster mass threshold for 2P-star formation a key building-block. We now expand this model to the pristine-star fraction in dependence of the pristine- and polluted-population masses. Milone et al.(2020) found that $F_{1P}$ anticorrelates more tightly with the polluted-population present-day mass, $m_{2P,prst}$, than with the cluster total mass, $m_{prst}$. In contrast, $F_{1P}$ anticorrelates poorly with the pristine-population current mass, $m_{1P,prst}$. We show the loose anticorrelation between $F_{1P}$ and $m_{1P,prst}$ to result from a roughly constant pristine-population mass among clusters as they start their long-term evolution in the Galactic tidal field. As for the tight anticorrelation between $m_{2P,prst}$ and $F_{1P}$, it stems from the initially shallow relation between $m_{2P}$ and $F_{1P}$ (Fig.4). Clusters of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively) appear to behave unexpectedly with respect to each other. For a given $F_{1P}$, LMC clusters are more massive than SMC clusters despite their enduring a stronger tidal field (Fig.6). This is opposite to how the Galactic outer- and inner-halo clusters behave (bottom panels of Figs 1-3). The explanation may lie in cluster formation conditions. Finally, we wonder whether the single-population clusters NGC~419 and Rup~106 formed as multiple-populations clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Owing to their similarities with giant exoplanets, brown dwarf companions of stars provide insights into the fundamental processes of planet formation and evolution. From their orbits, several brown dwarf companions are found to be more massive than theoretical predictions given their luminosities and the ages of their host stars (e.g. Brandt et al. 2021, Cheetham et al. 2018, Li et al. 2023). Either the theory is incomplete or these objects are not single entities. For example, they could be two brown dwarfs each with a lower mass and intrinsic luminosity (Brandt et al. 2021, Howe et al. 2024). The most problematic example is Gliese 229 B (Nakajima et al. 1995, Oppenheimer et al. 1995), which is at least 2-6 times less luminous than model predictions given its dynamical mass of $71.4\pm0.6$ Jupiter masses ($M_{\rm Jup}$) (Brandt et al. 2021). We observed Gliese 229 B with the GRAVITY interferometer and, separately, the CRIRES+ spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. Both sets of observations independently resolve Gliese 229 B into two components, Gliese 229 Ba and Bb, settling the conflict between theory and observations. The two objects have a flux ratio of $0.47\pm0.03$ at a wavelength of 2 $\mu$m and masses of $38.1\pm1.0$ and $34.4\pm1.5$ $M_{\rm Jup}$, respectively. They orbit each other every 12.1 days with a semimajor axis of 0.042 astronomical units (AU). The discovery of Gliese 229 BaBb, each only a few times more massive than the most massive planets, and separated by 16 times the Earth-moon distance, raises new questions about the formation and prevalence of tight binary brown dwarfs around stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a new, open-source, Python module for the acquisition and processing of archival data from many X-ray telescopes - Democratising Archival X-ray Astronomy (hereafter referred to as DAXA). Our software is built to increase access to, and use of, large archives of X-ray astronomy data; providing a unified, easy-to-use, Python interface to the disparate archives and processing tools. We provide this interface for the majority of X-ray telescopes launched within the last 30 years. This module enables much greater access to X-ray data for non-specialists, while preserving low-level control of processing for X-ray experts. It is useful for identifying relevant observations of a single object of interest but it excels at creating multi-mission datasets for serendipitous or targeted studies of large samples of X-ray emitting objects. The management and organization of datasets is also made easier; DAXA archives can be version controlled and updated if new data become available. Once relevant observations are identified, the raw data can be downloaded (and optionally processed) through DAXA, or pre-processed event lists, images, and exposure maps can be downloaded if they are available. X-ray observations are perfectly suited to serendipitous discoveries and archival analyses, and with a decade-long `X-ray desert' potentially on the horizon archival data will take on even greater importance; enhanced access to those archives will be vital to the continuation of X-ray astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Asymptotic Safety is a promising framework towards the understanding, in a non-perturbative way, of Quantum Gravity. It treats the Newton's constant G_N and the cosmological constant \Lambda as running coupling of an effective action. At the phenomenological point of view the values of G_N and \Lambda depend on the energy density of the system under consideration. This fact has interesting astrophysical and cosmological consequences. The present work discusses the effects on the distance measurements from SNIa light curves and on the strong and weak gravitational lensing measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery and characterization of TOI-4364\,b, a young mini-Neptune in the tidal tails of the Hyades cluster, identified through TESS transit observations and ground-based follow-up photometry. The planet orbits a bright M dwarf ($K=9.1$\,mag) at a distance of 44\,pc, with an orbital period of 5.42\,days and an equilibrium temperature of $488^{+4}_{-4}$\,K. The host star's well-constrained age of 710\,Myr makes TOI-4364\,b an exceptional target for studying early planetary evolution around low-mass stars. We determined a planetary radius of $2.01^{+0.1}_{-0.08}$\,Earth radii, indicating that this planet is situated near the upper edge of the radius valley. This suggests that the planet retains a modest H/He envelope. As a result, TOI-4364\,b provides a unique opportunity to explore the transition between rocky super-Earths and gas-rich mini-Neptunes at the early stages of evolution. Its radius, which may still evolve as a result of ongoing atmospheric cooling, contraction, and photoevaporation, further enhances its significance for understanding planetary development. Furthermore, TOI-4364\,b possesses a moderately high Transmission Spectroscopy Metric of 44.2, positioning it as a viable candidate for atmospheric characterization with instruments such as JWST. This target has the potential to offer crucial insights into atmospheric retention and loss in young planetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We present two epochs of radial velocities of the first imaged T dwarf Gliese 229B obtained with Keck/NIRSPEC. The two radial velocities are discrepant with one another, and with the radial velocity of the host star, at $\approx$$11\sigma$ significance. This points to the existence of a previously postulated, but as-yet undetected, massive companion to Gl 229B; we denote the two components as Gl 229Ba and Gl 229Bb. We compute the joint likelihood of the radial velocities to constrain the period and mass of the secondary companion. Our radial velocities are consistent with an orbital period between a few days and $\approx$60 days, and a secondary mass of at least $\approx$15\,$M_{\rm Jup}$ and up to nearly half the total system mass of Gl 229B. With a significant fraction of the system mass in a faint companion, the strong tension between Gl 229B's dynamical mass and the predictions of evolutionary models is resolved.

 - **Abstract**
 The Wide Field Monitor (WFM) is one of the three instruments on the Spectroscopic Time-Resolving Observatory for Broadband Energy X-rays (STROBE-X) mission, which was proposed in response to the NASA 2023 call for a probe class mission. The WFM is a coded-mask camera system that would be the most scientifically capable wide-angle monitor ever flown. The field of view covers one third of the sky, to 50 percent mask coding, and the energy sensitivity is 2 to 50 keV. The WFM is designed to identify new X-ray transients and to capture spectral and timing changes in known sources with data of unprecedented quality. Science applications cover diverse classes, in including X-ray bursts that coincide with gravitational wave detections, gamma ray bursts and their transition from prompt emission to afterglow, subluminous GRBs that may signal shock breakout in supernovae, state transitions in accreting compact objects and their jets, bright flares in fast X-ray transients, accretion onset in transitional pulsars, and coronal flares from many types of active stars.

          Global Simulations of Gravitational Instability in Protostellar Disks with Full Radiation Transport. I. Stochastic Fragmentation with Optical-depth-dependent Rate and Universal Fragment Mass

 - **Abstract**
 Fragmentation in a gravitationally unstable accretion disk can be an important pathway for forming stellar/planetary companions. To characterize quantitatively the condition for and outcome of fragmentation under realistic thermodynamics, we perform global 3D simulations of gravitationally unstable disks at various cooling rates and cooling types, including the first global simulations of gravitational instability that employ full radiation transport. We find that fragmentation is a stochastic process, with the fragment generation rate per disk area $p_{\rm frag}$ showing an exponential dependence on the parameter $\beta\equiv\Omega_K t_{cool}$, where $\Omega_K$ is the Keplerian rotation frequency and $t_{cool}$ is the average cooling timescale. Compared to a prescribed constant $\beta$, radiative cooling in the optically thin/thick regime makes $p_{\rm frag}$ decrease slower/faster in $\beta$; the critical $\beta$ corresponding to $\sim 1$ fragment per orbit is $\approx$3, 5, 2 for constant $\beta$, optically thin, and optically thick cooling, respectively. The distribution function of the initial fragment mass is remarkably insensitive to disk thermodynamics. Regardless of cooling rate and optical depth, the typical initial fragment mass is $m_{frag} \approx 40 M_{tot}h^3$, with $M_{tot}$ being the total (star+disk) mass and $h=H/R$ being the disk aspect ratio. Applying this result to typical Class 0/I protostellar disks, we find $m_{frag}\sim 20 M_J$, suggesting that fragmentation more likely forms brown dwarfs. Given the finite width of the $m_{frag}$ distribution, forming massive planets is also possible.

 - **Abstract**
 Adaptive optics (AO) systems are crucial for high-resolution astronomical observations by compensating for atmospheric turbulence. While laser guide stars (LGS) address high-order wavefront aberrations, natural guide stars (NGS) remain vital for low-order wavefront sensing (LOWFS). Conventional NGS-based methods like Shack-Hartmann sensors have limitations in field of view, sensitivity, and complexity. Focal plane wavefront sensing (FPWFS) offers advantages, including a wider field of view and enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, but accurately estimating low-order modes from distorted point spread functions (PSFs) remains challenging. We propose an AI-powered FPWFS method specifically for low-order mode estimation in infrared wavelengths. Our approach is trained on simulated data and validated on on-telescope data collected from the Keck I adaptive optic (K1AO) bench calibration source in K-band. By leveraging the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio in the infrared and the power of AI, our method overcomes the limitations of traditional LOWFS techniques. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of AI-based FPWFS for low-order wavefront sensing, paving the way for more compact, efficient, and high-performing AO systems for astronomical observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We use a custom-made calibrator to measure individual detectors' polarization angles of BICEP3, a small aperture telescope observing the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at 95GHz from the South Pole. We describe our calibration strategy and the statistical and systematic uncertainties associated with the measurement. We reach an unprecedented precision for such measurement on a CMB experiment, with a repeatability for each detector pair of $0.02°$. We show that the relative angles measured using this method are in excellent agreement with those extracted from CMB data. Because the absolute measurement is currently limited by a systematic uncertainty, we do not derive cosmic birefringence constraints from BICEP3 data in this work. Rather, we forecast the sensitivity of BICEP3 sky maps for such analysis. We investigate the relative contributions of instrument noise, lensing, and dust, as well as astrophysical and instrumental systematics. We also explore the constraining power of different angle estimators, depending on analysis choices. We establish that the BICEP3 2-year dataset (2017--2018) has an on-sky sensitivity to the cosmic birefringence angle of $\sigma = 0.078°$, which could be improved to $\sigma = 0.055°$ by adding all of the existing BICEP3 data (through 2023). Furthermore, we emphasize the possibility of using the BICEP3 sky patch as a polarization calibration source for CMB experiments, which with the present data could reach a precision of $0.035°$. Finally, in the context of inflation searches, we investigate the impact of detector-to-detector variations in polarization angles as they may bias the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. We show that while the effect is expected to remain subdominant to other sources of systematic uncertainty, it can be reliably calibrated using polarization angle measurements such as the ones we present in this paper.

 - **Abstract**
 The Magellanic Stream, a tidal tail of diffuse gas falling onto the Milky Way, formed by interactions between the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, is primarily composed of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI). The deficiency of dust and the diffuse nature of the present gas make molecular formation rare and difficult, but if present, could lead to regions potentially suitable for star formation, thereby allowing us to probe conditions of star formation similar to those at high redshifts. We search for HCO$^+$, HCN, HNC, and C$_2$H using the highest sensitivity observations of molecular absorption data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array to trace these regions, comparing with HI archival data to compare these environments in the Magellanic Stream to the HI column density threshold for molecular formation in the Milky Way. We also compare the line of sight locations with confirmed locations of stars, molecular hydrogen, and OI detections, though at higher sensitivities than the observations presented here. We find no detections to a 3$\sigma$ significance, despite four sightlines having column densities surpassing the threshold for molecular formation in the diffuse regions of the Milky Way. Here we present our calculations for the upper limits of the column densities of each of these molecular absorption lines, ranging from $3 \times 10^{10}$ to $1 \times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. The non-detection of HCO$^+$ suggests that at least one of the following is true: (i) $X_{HCO^+, \mathrm{MS}}$ is significantly lower than the Milky Way value; (ii) that the widespread diffuse molecular gas observed in the Milky Way's diffuse ISM does not have a direct analog in the MS; (iii) the HI-to-H$_2$ transition occurs in the MS at a higher surface density in the MS than in the LMC or SMC; or (iv) molecular gas exists in the MS, but only in small, dense clumps.

 - **Abstract**
 Over a hundred gravitational-wave signals have now been detected from the mergers of black holes and neutron stars, but other sources of gravitational waves have not yet been discovered. Some of the most violent explosive events in the Universe are predicted to emit bursts of gravitational waves, and may result in the next big multi-messenger discovery. Gravitational-wave burst signals often have an unknown waveform shape, and unknown gravitational-wave energy, due to unknown or very complicated progenitor astrophysics. Potential sources of gravitational-wave bursts include core-collapse supernovae, cosmic strings, fast radio bursts, eccentric binary systems, and gravitational-wave memory. In this review, we discuss the astrophysical properties of the main predicted sources of gravitational-wave bursts, and the known features of their gravitational-wave emission. We summarise their future detection prospects, and discuss the challenges of searching for gravitational-wave burst signals and interpreting the astrophysics of the source.

 - **Abstract**
 MAVIS (the MCAO-Assisted Visible Imager and Spectrograph), planned for the VLT Adaptive Optics Facility, represents an innovative step in Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems, particularly in its operation at visible wavelengths and anticipated contributions to the field of astronomical astrometry. Recognizing the crucial role of high-precision astrometry in realizing science goals such as studying the dynamics of dense starfields, this study focuses on the challenges of advancing astrometry with MAVIS to its limits, as well as paving the way for further enhancement by incorporating telemetry data as part of the astrometric analysis. We employ MAVISIM, Superstar, and DAOPHOT to simulate both MAVIS imaging performance and provide a pathway to incorporate telemetry data for precise astrometry with MAVIS. Photometry analyses are conducted using the Superstar and DAOPHOT platforms, integrated into a specifically designed pipeline for astrometric analysis in MCAO settings. Combining these platforms, our research aims to elucidate the impact of utilizing telemetry data on improving astrometric precision, potentially establishing new methods for ground-based AO-assisted astrometric analysis. This endeavor not only sheds light on the capabilities of MAVIS but also paves the way for advancing astrometry in the era of next-generation MCAO-enabled giant telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 The Thirty Meter Telescope will use a sophisticated adaptive optics system called NFIRAOS. This system utilizes two deformable mirrors conjugate to 0 km and 11.2 km to apply a Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) correction over a 2 arcminute field of view. DM0 and DM11 have 63 and 75 actuators across their respective diameters. To study the behavior of these mirrors, we have developed a low-cost, very high-order Shack-Hartmann Wavefront Sensor (WFS). We will use our WFS to calibrate the flatness of the DMs and measure the influence functions of the actuators. NFIRAOS is cooled to reduce the thermal emissivity of optical surfaces visible to the science detectors, so we will also measure the behaviour of the DMs in both warm and cold environments. As the cold chamber is prone to vibrations, a WFS is preferred to a phase-shifting interferometer. Our design was driven by the need to be able to evaluate the DM surface between the actuators, which led to the requirement of at least 248 sub apertures across the diameter. The largest commercially available Shack-Hartmann WFS has only 128 sub-apertures across the diameter, which is not enough to properly sample these DMs. Furthermore, the designed sensor is able to record the wavefront at 50 FPS (50 times per second) at full resolution. To fabricate this WFS, we used a commercial off-the-shelf CMOS detector, camera lens, and lens let array, which kept the total cost less than 20K USD. Here we present the design and performance characteristics of this device.

 - **Abstract**
 We present significant upgrades to the VAMPIRES instrument, a visible-light (600 nm to 800 nm) high-contrast imaging polarimeter integrated within SCExAO on the Subaru telescope. Key enhancements include new qCMOS detectors, coronagraphs, polarization optics, and a multiband imaging mode, improving sensitivity, resolution, and efficiency. These upgrades position VAMPIRES as a powerful tool for studying sub-stellar companions, accreting protoplanets, circumstellar disks, stellar jets, stellar mass-loss shells, and solar system objects. The instrument achieves angular resolutions from 17 mas to 21 mas and Strehl ratios up to 60\%, with 5$\sigma$ contrast limits of $10^{\text{-}4}$ at 0.1'' to $10^{\text{-}6}$ beyond 0.5''. We demonstrate these capabilities through spectro-polarimetric coronagraphic imaging of the HD 169142 circumstellar disk, ADI+SDI imaging of the sub-stellar companion HD 1160B, narrowband H$\alpha$ imaging of the R Aqr emission nebula, and spectro-polarimetric imaging of Neptune.

 - **Abstract**
 Dense clumps distributed along filaments are the immediate medium for star formation. Kinematic properties of the clumps, such as velocity gradient and angular momentum, combined with filament orientation, provide important clues to the formation mechanism of filament-clump configurations and the role of filaments in star formation. By cross-matching the Milky Way atlas for linear filaments and the Structure, Excitation and Dynamics of the Inner Galactic Interstellar Medium (SEDIGISM) 13CO (2-1) data, we aim to derive the velocity gradient and its direction, the specific angular momentum (J/M), and the ratio (\beta) between the rotational energy and gravitational energy of clumps, as well as to investigate the alignment between clump rotation and filament orientation. We found a monotonic increase in J/M as a function of clump size (R), following a power-law relation J/M~\propto~R^{1.5\pm0.2}. The ratio \beta ranges from 1.1~\times~10^{-5} to 0.1, with a median value 1.0~\times~10^{-3}, suggesting that clump rotation provides insignificant support against gravitational collapse. The distribution of the angle between clump rotation and natal filament orientation is random, indicating that the clumps' rotational axes have no discernible correlation with the orientation of their hosting filaments. Counting only the most massive clump in each filament also finds no alignment between clump rotation and filament orientation.

 - **Abstract**
 Ethanolamine (NH$_2$CH$_2$CH$_2$OH, EA) has been identified in the gas phase of the ISM within molecular clouds. Although EA has not been directly observed in the molecular ice phase, a solid state formation mechanism has been proposed. However, the current literature lacks an estimation of the infrared band strengths of EA ices. We conducted an experimental investigation of solid EA ice at low temperatures to ascertain its infrared band strengths, phase transition temperature, and multilayer binding energy. The commonly used laser interferometry method was not applied. Infrared band strengths were determined using three distinct methods. The obtained lab spectrum of EA was compared with the publicly available MIRI MRS James Webb Space Telescope observations toward a low mass protostar. The phase transition temperature for EA ice falls within the range of 175 to 185 K. Among the discussed methods, the simple pressure gauge method provides a reasonable estimate of band strength. We derive a band strength value of about $1\times10^{-17}$ cm molecule$^{-1}$ for the NH$_2$ bending mode in the EA molecules. Additionally, temperature-programmed desorption analysis yielded a multilayer desorption energy of 0.61$\pm$0.01 eV. By comparing the laboratory data documented in this study with the JWST spectrum of the low mass protostar IRAS 2A, an upper-limit for the EA ice abundances was derived.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous research on Lorentz invariance violation in photons from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) suggested a scenario where multi-GeV photons could be emitted before lower-energy photons at the GRB source frame. This implies the existence of a new preburst phase in addition to the traditionally identified prompt and afterglow stages observed in earlier studies. In this study, we present direct evidence for this novel preburst phase in gamma-ray bursts based on recent observations of GRB 221009A. Our analysis leverages data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and Large Area Telescope (LAT) detectors of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST), as well as data from the KM2A detector of the Large High Altitude Air-shower Observatory (LHAASO).

 - **Abstract**
 Analysing stellar parameters and abundances from nearly one million Gaia DR3 Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) spectra poses challenges due to the limited spectral coverage (restricted to the infrared Ca II triplet) and variable signal-to-noise ratios of the data. To address this, we use The Cannon, a data-driven method, to transfer stellar parameters and abundances from the GALAH Data Release 4 (DR4; R ~ 28,000) catalogue to the lower resolution Gaia DR3 RVS spectra (R ~ 11,500). Our model, trained on 14,484 common targets, predicts parameters such as Teff, log g, and [Fe/H], along with several other elements across approximately 800,000 Gaia RVS spectra. We utilise stars from open and globular clusters present in the Gaia RVS catalogue to validate our predicted mean [Fe/H] with high precision (~0.02-0.10 dex). Additionally, we recover the bimodal distribution of [Ti/Fe] versus [Fe/H], reflecting the high and low alpha-components of Milky Way disk stars, demonstrating The Cannon's capability for accurate stellar abundance determination from medium-resolution Gaia RVS spectra. The methodologies and resultant catalogue presented in this work highlight the remarkable potential of the RVS dataset, which by the end of the Gaia mission will comprise spectra of over 200 million stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova blasts envelop many surrounding stellar systems, transferring kinetic energy to small bodies in the systems. Geologic evidence from $^{60}\rm Fe$ points to recent nearby supernova activity within the past several Myr. Here, we model the transfer of energy and resulting orbital changes from these supernova blasts to the Oort Cloud, the Kuiper belt, and Saturn's Phoebe ring. For the Oort Cloud, an impulse approximation shows that a 50 pc supernova can eject approximately half of all objects less than 1 cm while altering the trajectories of larger ones, depending on their orbital parameters. For stars closest to supernovae, objects up to $\sim$100 m can be ejected. Turning to the explored solar system, we find that supernovae closer than 50 pc may affect Saturn's Phoebe ring and can sweep away Kuiper belt dust. It is also possible that the passage of the solar system through a dense interstellar cloud could have a similar effect; a numerical trajectory simulation shows that the location of the dust grains and the direction of the wind (from a supernova or interstellar cloud) has a significant impact on whether or not the grains will become unbound from their orbit in the Kuiper belt. Overall, nearby supernovae sweep micron-sized dust from the solar system, though whether the grains are ultimately cast towards the Sun or altogether ejected depends on various factors. Evidence of supernova-modified dust grain trajectories may be observed by New Horizons, though further modeling efforts are required.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate strong gravitational lensing by two static black hole models (Model-1 and Model-2) within the Effective Quantum Gravity (EQG) framework, characterized by mass $M$ and parameter $\zeta$. For $\zeta = 0$, they reduce to the Schwarzschild solution, and depending on the parameters, they describe black holes with an event and Cauchy horizon (Model-1), a single horizon (Model-2), or no horizons. Using SMBHs Sgr A* and M87* as lenses and integrating theoretical predictions with recent EHT data, we identify significant differences in lensing signatures due to quantum corrections. For Model-1, the deviations of the lensing observables: $|\delta\theta_{\infty}|$ of black holes in EQG from Schwarzschild black hole, for SMBHs Sgr A* and M87, can reach as much as $1.75~\mu$as and $1.32~\mu$as, while $|\delta s|$ is about $30.12$~nas for Sgr A* and $22.63$~nas for M87*. The flux ratio of the first image to all subsequent packed images indicates that EQG black hole images are brighter than their Schwarzschild counterparts, with a deviation in the brightness ratio $|\delta r_{mag}|$ reaching up to 2.02. The time delays between the second and first images, denoted $|\delta T_{2,1}|$, exhibit substantial deviations from the GR counterpart, reaching up to 1.53 min for Sgr A* and 1159.9 min for M87*. The EHT constraints on $\theta_{sh}$ of Sgr A* and M87* within the $1\sigma$ region limit the parameters $\zeta$. Our analysis concludes that EQG black holes are consistent with the EHT observations within this finite space.

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), consisting of a massive black hole and a stellar compact object, are one of the most important sources for space-borne gravitational wave detectors like TianQin. Their population study can be used to constrain astrophysical models that interpret the EMRI formation mechanisms. In this paper, as a first step, we employ a parametrization method to describe the EMRI population model in the loss cone formation channel. This approach, however, can be extended to other models such as the accretion disc driven formation channel. We present the phenomenological characteristic of the MBH mass, spin, and redshift distributions. Then, we investigate the posterior distribution of the hyper-parameters that describe this population model. Our results show that TianQin could recover almost all the posterior of the hyper-parameters within $1\sigma$ confidence interval. With one hundred detectable EMRI events, the hyper-parameters $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, b$, which describe the MBH mass distribution, could be measured with an accuracy of $37\%$, $24\%$, and $3\%$, respectively. The hyper-parameters $\mu_z$, and $\sigma_z$, which describe the redshift distribution, have $\mu_z$ above the detectable range of TianQin, and $\sigma_z$ measured with an accuracy of $14.5\%$. With this estimation accuracy, the EMRI population characteristics can be effectively demonstrated, potentially serving as evidence for EMRI formation in the future studies. Furthermore, with an increasing number of detectable events, the parameter estimation for the hyper-parameters will improve and the confidence intervals will be narrowed.

          Mitigating baryon feedback bias in cosmic shear through a theoretical error covariance in the matter power spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 Forthcoming cosmic shear surveys will make precise measurements of the matter density field down to very small scales, scales which are dominated by baryon feedback. The modelling of baryon feedback is crucial to ensure unbiased cosmological parameter constraints; the most efficient approach is to use analytic models, but these are limited by how well they can capture the physics of baryon feedback. We investigate the fitting and residual errors of various baryon feedback models to a suite of hydrodynamic simulations, and propagate these to cosmological parameter constraints for cosmic shear. We present an alternative formalism to binary scale-cuts through the use of a theoretical error covariance, which is a well-motivated alternative using errors in the power spectrum modelling itself. We depart from previous works by modelling baryonic feedback errors directly in the matter power spectrum, which is the natural basis to do so and thus preserves information in the lensing kernels. When including angular multipoles up to $\ell_{\mathrm{max}} = 5000$, and assuming Euclid-like survey properties, we find that even multi-parameter models of baryon feedback can introduce significant levels of bias. In contrast, our theoretical error reduces the bias in $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $S_{8}$ to acceptable levels, with only a modest increase in parameter variances. The theoretical error approach bypasses the need to directly determine the per-bin $\ell_{\mathrm{max}}$ values, as it naturally suppresses the biassing small-scale information. We also present a detailed study of how flexible HMCode-2020, a widely-used non-linear and baryonic feedback model, is at fitting a range of hydrodynamical simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars can experience proton ingestion events (PIEs), leading to a rich nucleosynthesis. During a PIE, the intermediate neutron capture process (i-process) develops, leading to the production of trans-iron elements. It is also suggested that lithium is produced during these events. We investigate the production of lithium and trans-iron elements in AGB stars experiencing a PIE with $1<M_{\rm ini}/M_{\odot}< 3$ and $-3< \mathrm{[Fe/H]} <0$. We find that lithium is produced in all PIE models with surface abundances $3<$ A(Li) $<5$. The surface enrichment and overall AGB lithium yield increases with decreasing stellar mass. The lithium enrichment is accompanied by a production of $^{13}$C with $3<^{12}$C/$^{13}$C$<9$ at the surface just after the PIE. AGB stars experiencing PIE may be related to J-type carbon stars whose main features are excesses of lithium and $^{13}$C. In addition to Li and $^{13}$C, heavy elements (e.g., Sr, Ba, Eu, Pb) are significantly produced in low-metallicity stars up to [Fe/H]$\simeq-1$. The yields of our models are publicly available. Additionally, of interest to the Li nucleosynthesis, we provide an updated fitting formula for the $^{7}$Be($e^-,\nu_e$)$^{7}$Li electron capture rate.

          Most High-density Exoplanets Are Unlikely to Be Remnant Giant-planet Cores

 - **Abstract**
 Some exoplanets have much higher densities than expected from stellar abundances of planet-forming elements. There are two theories - metal-rich formation hypothesis and naked core hypothesis - that explain how formation and evolution can alter the compositions and structures of rocky planets to diverge from their primordial building blocks. Here, we revisit the naked core hypothesis, which states that high-density planets are remnant cores of giant planets that remain in a fossil-compressed state, even after envelope loss. Using a planetary interior model and assuming energy-limited atmospheric escape, we show that a large fraction, if not all, of the iron-silicate core of a giant planet is molten during the planet's early evolution. Upon envelope loss, molten part of the planets can rapidly rebound due to low viscosity, resulting in a decrease in radius by at most 0.06%, if they had hydrogen/helium envelopes, or by at most 7%, if they had H$_2$O envelopes, compared to self-compressed counterparts with the same core mass fraction. Based on our findings, we reject the hypothesis that all high-density exoplanets are naked cores with Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-value $\ll$ 0.05 for both envelope compositions. We find that some high-density exoplanets can still possibly be naked cores, but the probabilities are lower than $\sim$1/2 and $\sim$1/3 for the ice giant and gas giant scenario, respectively, in 95% of the cases. We conclude that most high-density exoplanets are unlikely to be remnant giant-planets cores.

 - **Abstract**
 We present evidence for $\gamma$-ray emission from a stacked population of 39 high-latitude globular clusters (GCs) not detected in the Fermi Point Source Catalog, likely attributable to populations of millisecond pulsars within them. In this work, we use 13 years of data collected by the Large Area Telescope aboard the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope to search for a cumulative signal from undetected GCs and compared them to control fields (CFs), selected to match the celestial distribution of the target clusters so as to distinguish the $\gamma$-ray signal from background emission. The joint likelihood distribution of the GCs has a significant separation ($\sim4\sigma$) from that of the CFs. We also investigate correlations between detected cluster luminosities and other cluster properties such as distance, the number of millisecond pulsars associated with each cluster, and stellar encounter rate but find no significant relationships.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive main-sequence stars have convective cores and radiative envelopes, and sub-surface convection zones. However, their properties strongly depend on a star's opacity and metallicity. Non-rotating 1D evolution models of main-sequence stars between $7 \leq M \leq 40$ M$_{\odot}$ and metallicity of the SMC suggest tenuous sub-surface convection zones when using the Rayleigh number as a criterion for convection. We test if massive stars of different metallicities inside and outside of stability windows for sub-surface convection exhibit similar properties in their observed SLF variability. We extract customised light curves from the ongoing TESS mission for a sample of massive stars using an effective point spread function (ePSF) method, and compare them using a Gaussian process (GP) regression methodology. We demonstrate that the properties of SLF variability observed in time-series photometry of massive stars are consistent across the metallicity range from the Milky Way down to the SMC galaxy, for stars both inside and outside of the sub-surface stability windows. We conclude that non-rotating 1D stellar structure models of sub-surface convection cannot alone be used to explain the mechanism giving rise to SLF variability in light curves of massive stars. Additionally, the similar properties of SLF variability across a large range in metallicity, which follow the same trends in mass and age in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram at both high and low metallicity, support a transition in the dominant mechanism causing SLF variability from younger to more evolved stars. Specifically, core-excited internal gravity waves (IGWs) are more favourable for younger stars that lack substantial sub-surface convection zones, especially at low-metallicity, and sub-surface convection zones are more favourable for the most massive and evolved stars.

The de Sitter equilibrium is the dynamical state of the Laplace resonance in which all resonant arguments are librating. The sequence of equilibria exists all along the possible states balancing resonance offsets and forced eccentricities. Possible additional new-de Sitter equilibria may exist when at least one of the forced eccentricities is large (the paradigmatic case is Gliese-876). In the present work, these families of equilibria are traced up to crossing exact commensurability, where approximate first-order solutions diverge. Explicit exact location of the equilibria are determined allowing us to verify the Lyapunov stability of the standard de Sitter equilibrium and of the stable branches of the additional ones.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the main open questions in the field of luminous ($L_{\rm bol}>10^{47}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$) quasars (QSOs) at $z \gtrsim 6$ is the rapid formation ($< 1\,$Gyr) of their supermassive black holes (SMBHs). For this work we analysed the relation between the X-ray properties and other properties describing the physics and growth of both the accretion disc and the SMBH in QSOs at the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The sample consists of 21 $z>6$ QSOs, which includes 16 sources from the rapidly grown QSOs from the HYPERION sample and five other luminous QSOs with available high-quality archival X-ray data. We discovered a strong and statistically significant ($>3\sigma$) relation between the X-ray continuum photon index ($\Gamma$) and the $\rm C\,IV$ disc wind velocity ($v_{\rm C\,IV}$) in $z>6$ luminous QSOs, whereby the higher the $v_{\rm C\,IV}$, the steeper the $\Gamma$. This relation suggests a link between the disc-corona configuration and the kinematics of disc winds. Furthermore, we find evidence at $>2-3\sigma$ level that $\Gamma$ and $v_{\rm C\,IV}$ are correlated to the growth rate history of the SMBH. Although additional data are needed to confirm it, this result may suggest that, in luminous $z>6$ QSOs, the SMBH predominantly grows via fast accretion rather than via initial high seed BH mass.
