          Picture Perfect: Photometric Transient Classification Using the ParSNIP Model with Roman Hourglass Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 The Roman Space Telescope, equipped with a 2.4 meter primary mirror and optical--NIR wide-field camera, promises to revolutionize our understanding of dark energy, exoplanets, and infrared astrophysics. One of the Roman Core Community Surveys is the High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS), which will measure more than 10,000 SN Ia light curves but obtain a fraction of this number with spectra. The remaining SNe will have to be photometrically classified to achieve the full potential of the Roman HLTDS. To investigate transient yields and classifications, Rose et al. (in prep.) updated the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) framework (originally developed for the Vera Rubin Observatory) for the Roman HLTDS. This study leverages this Roman Hourglass dataset to train and evaluate the ParSNIP (Parameterized Supernova Identification Pipeline) model. We employ this model to classify various transient types from photometric data, paying particular attention to the types most represented in the dataset: normal SNe Ia, 91bg-like SNe Ia, SNe Iax, and CC SNe. The ParSNIP model performance is assessed through confusion matrices and ROC curves across different redshift ranges. Our analysis reveals that while the model performs robustly at higher redshifts (with the AUC for classification varying between 0.9 and 0.95 in the range 0.5 < z < 2), its accuracy dips at the lowest redshifts of the survey, likely due to limited training data. These findings underscore the importance of ensuring adequate representation of classes in the training set. This work underscores the value of machine learning models for next-generation surveys, paving the way for future studies with the Roman Space Telescope for survey optimization, cosmological forecasts, and synergies with other surveys.

          Tracing cosmic gas in filaments and halos: Low-redshift insights from the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we leverage CMB data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and LSS data from the imaging survey conducted by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to study the distribution of gas around galaxy groups at low redshift, $z \approx 0.3$, via the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. In particular, we perform velocity-weighted stacking on the photometric Bright Galaxy Sample (BGS) to isolate the monopole and quadrupole of the kSZ signal, orienting the stacked images along 2D filaments identified using the Hessian of the projected gravitational potential. We find a 7.2$\sigma$ detection in the monopole of the signal (i.e., the gas density profile) and a 4$\sigma$ detection in the quadrupole ($m = 2$), constituting the first measurement of the alignment between gas distribution and the cosmic web through the kSZ effect. As it is a linear probe of the local gas density, the kSZ has heightened sensitivity to the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), which is believed to house the majority of the ``missing baryons.'' Mapping out the gas density at low redshifts, as enabled by our measurements, is crucial for weak lensing surveys, for which the impact of baryons on small scales is a major impediment. We compare the anisotropic signal against two hydrodynamical simulations, TNG300-1 and Illustris, which have very different baryonic feedback prescriptions. We find that the anisotropic signal measured in the data is comparable but slightly larger and more extended compared with the simulations. This suggests that there is excess accretion and feedback taking place through the filaments, hinting at the possible presence of spin-filament alignment of the BGS objects.

          Image-Constrained Modeling with Hubble and Keck Images Reveals that OGLE-2012-BLG-0563Lb is a Jupiter-Mass planet Orbiting a K Dwarf

 - **Abstract**
 We present high angular resolution imaging from the {\sl Hubble Space Telescope} combined with adaptive optics imaging results from the {\sl Keck}-II telescope to determine the mass of the OGLE-2012-BLG-0563L host star and planet to be $M_{\rm host} = 0.801\pm 0.033M_\odot$ and $M_{\rm planet} = 1.116 \pm 0.087 M_{\rm Jupiter}$, respectively, located at a distance of $D_L = 5.46\pm 0.56\,$kpc. There is a close-wide degeneracy in the light curve models that indicates star-planet projected separation of $1.50\pm 0.16\,$AU for the close model and $8.41\pm 0.87\,$AU for the wide model. We used the image-constrained modeling method to analyze the light curve data with constraints from this high angular resolution image analysis. This revealed systematic errors in some of the ground-based light curve photometry that led to an estimate of the angular Einstein Radius, $\theta_E$, that was too large by a factor of $\sim 2$. The host star mass is a factor of 2.4 larger than the value presented in the \citet{fukui15} discovery paper. Although most systematic photometry errors seen in ground-based microlensing light curve photometry will not be repeated in data from the {\sl Roman Space Telescope}'s Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey, we argue that image constrained modeling will be a valuable method to identify possible systematic errors in {\sl Roman} photometry.

          Exploring velocity dispersion anisotropy in a dark matter dominated ultra-diffuse galaxy with modified gravity models

 - **Abstract**
 The kinematics of the ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) NGC1052-DF44 is primarily influenced by the presence of dark matter (DM). In this paper, we conduct a contrasting kinematic study of DF44 within the alternative modified gravity framework. In comparison to NFW DM, we test three alternative gravity models viz Milgromian dynamics (MOND), characterized by a known acceleration scale, a generic $f(R)$ model, assuming an expansion of the Ricci scalar, and a quantum gravity-inspired Renormalization Group correction to General Relativity (RGGR), which involves the running of the gravitational coupling parameter $G$ with the Universe's energy scale. For each gravity model, we evaluate the velocity dispersion (VD) of the galaxy beyond the conventional radial isotropic assumption and extend to two anisotropy scenarios, i.e., constant and Osipkov-Merritt. Our results show that all three gravity models can provide consistent fits to the observed VD of DF44; however, only MOND and RGGR remain competitive with NFW DM. Interestingly, the constant anisotropy scenario in all the models is also found to be competitive with the complete isotropic assumption.

 - **Abstract**
 Water has proven to be ubiquitously detected in near-infrared (NIR) transmission spectroscopy observations of hot Jupiter atmospheres, including WASP-17b. However, previous analyses of WASP-17b's atmosphere based upon Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Spitzer data could not constrain the water abundance, finding that sub-solar, super-solar and bimodal posterior distributions were all statistically valid. In this work, we observe one transit of the hot Jupiter WASP-17b using JWST's Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph Single Object Slitless Spectroscopy (NIRISS SOSS) mode. We analyze our data using three independent data analysis pipelines, finding excellent agreement between results. Our transmission spectrum shows multiple H$_2$O absorption features and a flatter slope towards the optical than seen in previous HST observations. We analyze our spectrum using both PICASO+Virga forward models and free retrievals. POSEIDON retrievals provide a well-constrained super-solar $\log$(H$_2$O) abundance (-2.96$^{+0.31}_{-0.24}$), breaking the degeneracy from the previous HST/Spitzer analysis. We verify our POSEIDON results with petitRADTRANS retrievals. Additionally, we constrain the abundance of $\log$(H$^-$), -10.19$^{+0.30}_{-0.23}$, finding that our model including H$^-$ is preferred over our model without H$^-$ to 5.1 $\sigma$. Furthermore, we constrain the $\log$(K) abundance (-8.07$^{+0.58}_{-0.52}$) in WASP-17b's atmosphere for the first time using space-based observations. Our abundance constraints demonstrate the power of NIRISS SOSS's increased resolution, precision, and wavelength range to improve upon previous NIR space-based results. This work is part of a series of studies by our JWST Telescope Scientist Team (JWST-TST), in which we use Guaranteed Time Observations to perform Deep Reconnaissance of Exoplanet Atmospheres through Multi-instrument Spectroscopy (DREAMS).

          A deep Chandra study verifies diffuse non-thermal X-ray emission from the globular cluster Terzan 5

 - **Abstract**
 Diffuse X-ray emission has been detected from a few Galactic globular clusters (GCs), whereas its nature still remains largely unclear. The GC Terzan 5 was previously found to show a significant diffuse thermal X-ray excess from its field, likely contributed by the Galactic background, and a non-thermal component described by a power-law model with photon index $\Gamma \sim 1$. With over 16 times the accumulated Chandra exposure time as in the prior study, we are motivated to reexamine and verify the diffuse X-ray emission from the field of Terzan 5, enabling constraints on its nature. We verify a significant diffuse X-ray excess from the field of Terzan 5 in the band 0.8--3 keV. After constraining the contribution from local X-ray background, we find a diffuse X-ray component that is genuinely associated with Terzan 5, which can be well described by a power-law model. More interestingly, the fitted photon indices show a significant increase from $\Gamma = 1.96 \pm 0.18$ in the inner region to $\Gamma = 3.48 \pm 0.71$ in the outer region. The diffuse X-rays can also be well fitted by a thermal bremsstrahlung model, with plasma temperatures declining from $kT \sim 3$ keV to $kT \sim 1$ keV. We suggest that synchrotron radiation from the combined pulsar winds of Terzan 5's millisecond pulsar population is a possible origin of the observed diffuse X-ray emission, but the the large steepening in the spectra cannot be produced solely by synchrotron cooling. Other radiation processes, like thermal bremsstrahlung, may also contribute to the diffuse X-rays.

 - **Abstract**
 The O- and B-type (OB-type) pulsating stars are important objects to study the structure and evolution of massive stars through asteroseismology. A large amount of data from various sky surveys provide an unprecedented opportunity to search for and study this kind of variable star. We identify 155 OB-type pulsating stars or candidates, including 38 Oe/Be stars or candidates, from the data observed by TESS, LAMOST, and GAIA, which are almost new. Among the 155 objects, 87 samples are identified as SPB stars including 37 objects with pure low-frequency and 50 objects with both low- and high-frequency pulsation, and 14 samples are identified as BCEP stars with both low- and high-frequency pulsation. The H-R diagram shows that these SPB and BCEP stars are mainly located in their instability regions and in the evolutionary stage of the main-sequence with a mass range of 2.5-20 $M_{\odot}$ and 7-20 $M_{\odot}$. Two special objects show fourier spectra similar to BCEP stars but with different positions in H-R, Period-Temperature (P-T), and Period-Luminosity (P-L) diagrams. Meanwhile, 52 other targets are identified as candidates of OB-type pulsating stars. We also derive the preliminary results of the P-L relation for SPB and BCEP stars, respectively. This work also indicates that in addition to the H-R diagram, P-T and P-L diagrams are also very useful for the classification of SPB and BCEP. Further detailed analysis of these objects can dramatically increase our understanding of theories of evolution and structure for massive OB-type pulsating stars.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper reports the discovery of new slowly pulsating B-type stars. Based on the photometric, spectral, and astrometric data of TESS, LAMOST, and Gaia surveys, we have found 286 new slowly pulsating B-type stars (SPB stars) and 21 candidates. Among these, 20 are Be stars or candidates with emission line profiles. It is shown that these SPB stars have luminosities between 40 and 2850 $L_{\odot}$ and effective temperatures ranging from 10000K to 21000K. Their pulsation periods are from 0.14 to 6.5 days with amplitude ranges of 0.2-20 mmag in TESS band. It is indicated that these targets follow the distribution of the SPB stars in the period-luminosity (P-L) and the period-temperature (P-T) diagrams. Their positions on the H-R diagram reveal that most of these pulsators are distributed in the instability region of SPB stars, in the main-sequence evolutionary stage, and with mass ranges of 2.5-7 $M_{\odot}$. However, there are some targets beyond the red edge of the theoretical instability region, which should be caused by the rapid rotation reducing the measured effective temperature. The discovery of these new SPB stars increases the total number by over 60\%, which are significant samples for further investigating the structure and evolution of intermediate-mass and even massive stars by asteroseismology.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of radio-quiet, X-ray thermally emitting isolated neutron stars (XINSs) in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey revealed a previously overlooked component of the neutron star population. Advancements in X-ray instrumentation and the availability of deep, wide-area optical surveys now enable us to explore XINSs at fainter X-ray fluxes and greater distances. In this study, we investigated candidates selected from the 4XMM-DR9 catalogue using XMM-Newton, focusing on long-term flux stability, spectral characterisation, and astrometry. By leveraging resources from the XMM2ATHENA project -- including updated catalogues, multiwavelength characterisation and machine learning classification -- we refined our understanding of this sample of soft X-ray emitters. Our findings enhance the characterisation of XINS candidates, laying the groundwork for more targeted investigations and future catalogue searches.

          Predictions of Dust Continuum Emission from a Potential Circumplanetary Disk: A Case Study of the Planet Candidate AB Aurigae b

 - **Abstract**
 Gas accreting planets embedded in protoplanetary disks are expected to show dust thermal emission from their circumplanetary disks (CPDs). However, a recently reported gas accreting planet candidate, AB Aurigae b, has not been detected in (sub)millimeter continuum observations. We calculate the evolution of dust in the potential CPD of AB Aurigae b and predict its thermal emission at 1.3 mm wavelength as a case study, where the obtained features may also be applied to other gas accreting planets. We find that the expected flux density from the CPD is lower than the 3-sigma level of the previous continuum observation by ALMA with broad ranges of parameters, consistent with the non-detection. However, the expected planet mass and gas accretion rate are higher if the reduction of the observed near-infrared continuum and H-alpha line emission due to the extinction by small grains is considered, resulting in higher flux density of the dust emission from the CPD at (sub)millimeter wavelength. We find that the corrected predictions of the dust emission are stronger than the 3-sigma level of the previous observation with the typical dust-to-gas mass ratio of the inflow to the CPD. This result suggests that the dust supply to the vicinity of AB Aurigae b is small if the planet candidate is not the scattered light of the star but is a planet and has a CPD. Future continuum observations at shorter wavelength are preferable to obtain more robust clues to the question whether the candidate is a planet or not.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic ray (CR) flux, as well as the hydrogen flux into the atmosphere of an exoplanet, can change the composition of the atmosphere. Here, we present the CR and hydrogen flux on top of the atmosphere. To do so, we have to study the 3D multifluid MHD structure of astrospheres. We discuss the shock structure of the stellar wind of LHS 1140 using four different models: HD and MHD single-fluid models, as well as multifluid models for both cases, including a neutral hydrogen flow from the interstellar medium. The CR flux in a multifluid model as well as the ionization rate in an exoplanetary atmosphere are also presented. The astrosphere is modeled using the 3D Cronos code, while the CR flux at LHS 1140 b is calculated using both a 1D and a 3D stochastic galactic CR modulation code. Finally, the atmospheric ionization and radiation dose is estimated using the AtRIS code. Results. It is shown that the 3D multifluid positions of the termination shock differ remarkably from those found in the 3D ideal-single fluid hydrodynamic case. CR fluxes computed using a 1D approach are completely different from those calculated using the 3D modulation code and show an essentially unmodulated spectrum at the exoplanet in question. Utilizing these spectra, ionization rates and radiation exposure within the atmosphere of LHS 1140 b are derived. The termination shock, astropause, and bow shock distances must be taken from the 3D multifluid MHD model to determine the CR fluxes correctly. Moreover, because of the tiny astrosphere, the exoplanet is submerged in the neutral hydrogen flow of the interstellar medium, which will influence the exoplanetary atmosphere. A 3D approach to Galactic\0 cosmic ray (GCR) modulation in astrospheres is also necessary to avoid unrealistic estimates of GCR intensities.

          Restoring Missing Modes of 21cm Intensity Mapping with Deep Learning: Impact on BAO Reconstruction

 - **Abstract**
 In 21cm intensity mapping of the large-scale structure (LSS), regions in Fourier space could be compromised by foreground contamination. In interferometric observations, this contamination, known as the foreground wedge, is exacerbated by the chromatic response of antennas, leading to substantial data loss. Meanwhile, the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) reconstruction, which operates in configuration space to "linearize" the BAO signature, offers improved constraints on the sound horizon scale. However, missing modes within these contaminated regions can negatively impact the BAO reconstruction algorithm. To address this challenge, we employ the deep learning model U-Net to recover the lost modes before applying the BAO reconstruction algorithm. Despite hardware limitations, such as GPU memory, our results demonstrate that the AI-restored 21cm temperature map achieves a high correlation with the original signal, with a correlation ratio of approximately $0.9$ at $k \sim 1 h/Mpc$. Furthermore, subsequent BAO reconstruction indicates that the AI restoration has minimal impact on the performance of the `linearized' BAO signal, proving the effectiveness of the machine learning approach to mitigate the impact of foreground contamination. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the AI model trained on coarser fields can be effectively applied to finer fields, achieving even higher correlation. This success is likely attributable to the scale-invariance properties of non-linear mode coupling in large-scale structure and the hierarchical structure of the U-Net architecture.

 - **Abstract**
 During their thermally pulsing phase, Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars eject material that forms extended dusty envelopes. Visible polarimetric imaging found clumpy dust clouds within two stellar radii of several oxygen-rich stars. Inhomogeneous molecular gas has also been observed in multiple emission lines within several stellar radii of different oxygen rich stars, including W Hya and Mira. At the stellar surface level, infrared images have revealed intricate structures around the carbon semi-regular variable R Scl and in the S-type star $\pi^{\mathrm{1}}$ Gru. Infrared images have also shown clumpy dust structures within a few stellar radii of the prototypical carbon AGB star IRC+10216, and studies of the molecular gas distribution beyond the dust formation zone have also shown complex circumstellar structures. Because of the lack of sufficient spatial resolution, however, the distribution of molecular gas in the stellar atmosphere and the dust formation zone of AGB carbon stars is not known, nor is how it is subsequently expelled. Here we report observations with a resolution of one stellar radius of the recently formed dust and molecular gas in the atmosphere of IRC+10216. Lines of HCN, SiS, and SiC$_2$ appear at different radii and in different clumps, which we interpret as large convective cells in the photosphere, as seen in Betelgeuse. The convective cells coalesce with pulsation causing anisotropies that, together with companions, shape its circumstellar envelope.

 - **Abstract**
 The giant molecular cloud complex Sagittarius B2 (Sgr~B2) in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy hosts several high-mass star formation sites, with Sgr~B2(M) and Sgr~B2(N) being the main centers of activity. This analysis aims to comprehensively model each core spectrum, considering molecular lines, dust attenuation, and free-free emission interactions. We describe the molecular content analysis of each hot core and identify the chemical composition of detected sources. Using ALMA's high sensitivity, we aim to characterize the hot core population in Sgr~B2(M) and N, gaining a better understanding of the different evolutionary phases of star formation processes in this complex. We conducted an unbiased ALMA spectral line survey of 47 sources in band 6 (211-275 GHz). Chemical composition and column densities were derived using XCLASS, assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium. Quantitative descriptions for each molecule were determined, considering all emission and absorption features across the spectral range. Temperature and velocity distributions were analyzed, and derived abundances were compared with other spectral line surveys. We identified 65 isotopologs from 48 different molecules, ranging from light molecules to complex organic compounds, originating from various environments. Most sources in the Sgr~B2 complex were assigned different evolutionary phases of high-mass star formation. Sgr~B2(N) hot cores show more complex molecules such as CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$OCHO, and CH$_3$OCH$_3$, while M cores contain lighter molecules such as SO$_2$, SO, and NO. Some sulfur-bearing molecules are more abundant in N than in M. The derived molecular abundances can be used for comparison and to constrain astrochemical models. Inner sources in both regions were generally more developed than outer sources, with some exceptions.

 - **Abstract**
 The BL Lac object 3C 371 is one of the targets that are regularly monitored by the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) Collaboration to study blazar variability on both short and long timescales. We aim to evaluate the long-term multiwavelength (MWL) behaviour of 3C 371, comparing it with the results derived for its optical emission in our previous study. For this, we make use of the multi-band campaigns organized by the WEBT Collaboration in optical and radio between January 2018 and December 2020, and of public data from Swift and Fermi satellites and the MOJAVE Very Large Interferometry programme. We evaluate the variability shown by the source in each band with the amplitude variability quantification, as well as possible interband correlation using the z-Discrete Correlation Function. We also present a deep analysis of the optical-UV, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray spectral variability. With the MOJAVE data we perform a kinematics analysis, looking for components propagating along the jet, calculating its kinematics parameters. This set of parameters is later used for the interpretation of the source MWL behaviour, modelling the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the source with theoretical blazar emission scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurately determining neutrino masses is a main objective of contemporary cosmology. Since massive neutrinos affect structure formation and evolution, probes of large scale structure are sensitive to the sum of their masses. In this work, we explore future constraints on $\sum m_\nu$ utilizing line-intensity mapping (LIM) as a promising emerging probe of the density of our Universe, focusing on the fine-structure [CII] line as an example, and compare these constraints with those derived from traditional galaxy surveys. Additionally, we perform a multi-tracer analysis using velocity tomography via the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich and moving lens effects to reconstruct the three-dimensional velocity field. Our forecasts indicate that the next-generation AtLAST detector by itself can achieve $\sigma_{\Sigma m_\nu} \sim 50$ meV sensitivity. Velocity tomography will further improve these constraints by 4%. Incorporating forecasts for CMB-S4 and DESI-BAO in a comprehensive multi-tracer analysis, while setting a prior on the optical depth to reionization $\tau$ derived using 21-cm forecasted observations, to break degeneracies, we find that a $\gtrsim5\sigma$ detection of $\sum m_\nu\!\sim\! 60$ meV, under the normal hierarchy, is within reach with LIM. Even without a $\tau$ prior, our combined forecast reaches $\sigma_{\Sigma m_\nu} \!\sim\! 18$ meV.

 - **Abstract**
 Irradiation by energetic ions, electrons, and UV photons induces sputtering and chemical processes (radiolysis) in the surfaces of icy moons, comets, and icy grains. Laboratory experiments, both of ideal surfaces and of more complex and realistic analog samples, are crucial to understand the interaction of surfaces of icy moons and comets with their space environment. This study shows the first results of mass spectrometry measurements from porous water ice regolith samples irradiated with electrons as a representative analogy to water-ice rich surfaces in the solar system. Previous studies have shown that most electron-induced H2O radiolysis products leave the ice as H2 and O2 and that O2 can be trapped under certain conditions in the irradiated ice. Our new laboratory experiments confirm these findings. Moreover, they quantify residence times and saturation levels of O2 in originally pure water ice. H2O may also be released from the water ice by irradiation, but the quantification of the released H2O is more difficult and the total amount is sensitive to the electron flux and energy.

 - **Abstract**
 The three-dimensional velocity structure of the shock-heated Si-reach and S-reach ejecta were reconstructed in Tycho supernova remnant from Doppler-shifted lines. The vector components along the line of sight were restored from the spatially resolved spectral analysis of the Doppler shifts of Si XIII and S XV lines. The components in the plane of the sky were derived from analysis of the proper motion of the remnant's edge at different azimuths. This has been done by using the data of X-ray observations from Chandra observatory as well as the radio data from the Very Large Array. Differences in Doppler velocities over the Tycho's SNR are of the order of thousands of km/s. The speed of the ejecta on the opposite sides of the remnant as a three-dimensional object differs on 20-30%. There are asymmetries and differences in the spatial distributions between the Si-reach and S-reach ejecta components. Namely, the level of isotropy is higher in Si while the vector components directed outward of the observer are larger in S. This puts limitations on the level of deviation of the internal structure of the progenitor star from the ideal layered structure as well as on the level of asymmetries in supernova explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the first detection by the DASI experiment in 2002, measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have grown into an important role in testing our understanding of conditions in the early universe and cosmology. The field has seen rapid experimental progress, driven in large part by the desire to make increasingly precise measurements of CMB polarization. Precise measurements of the CMB polarization anisotropies contain as much information as the CMB temperature anisotropy, and promise to unlock new tests of physics and the standard cosmological model. In this chapter, we first discuss how polarization is produced through Thomson scattering, after which types of polarization patterns are connected to the cosmological sources. Finally, we briefly discuss the experimental hardware that enables these measurements.

          A $\Lambda$CDM Extension Explaining the Hubble Tension and the Spatial Curvature $\Omega_{k,0} = -0.012 \pm 0.010$ Measured by the Final PR4 of the Planck Mission

 - **Abstract**
 The measurements of the CMB have determined the cosmological parameters with high accuracy, and the observation of the flatness of space have contributed to the status of the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. However, the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, necessary to close the model to critical density, remains an open conundrum. We explore the observed late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe, where we consider that the Friedmann equation describes the expansion history of FLRW universes in the local reference frame of freely falling comoving observers, which perceive flat, homogeneous and isotropic space in their local inertial system, where, as a consequence of the equivalence principle, special relativity applies. We use this fact to propose an extension to $\Lambda$CDM, incorporating the initial conditions of the background universe, comprising the initial energy densities as well as the initial post big bang expansion rate. The observed late-time accelerated expansion is then attributed to a kinematic effect akin to a dark energy component. Choosing the same $\Omega_{m,0} \simeq 0.3$ as $\Lambda$CDM, its equation of state $w_{de} \simeq -0.8$. Furthermore, we include the impact on the expansion history caused by the cosmic web of the late Universe, once voids dominate its volume, and find that the initially constant $w_{de}$ becomes time-dependent, evolving to a value of $w_{de} \simeq -0.9$ at the present. While this impact by voids is minor, it is sufficient to provide a solution to the Hubble tension problem. We use CLASS to calculate the expansion history and power spectra of our extension and compare our results to concordance $\Lambda$CDM and to observations. We find that our model agrees well with current data, in particular with the final data release PR4 of the Planck mission, where it explains the reported spatial curvature of $\Omega_{k,0} = - 0.012 \pm 0.010$.

 - **Abstract**
 The combination of detection techniques enhances our ability to identify companions orbiting nearby stars. We employed high-contrast imaging to constrain mass and separation of possible companions responsible for the significant proper motion anomalies of the nearby stars HIP 11696, HIP 47110 and HIP 36277. These targets were observed using the LBT's high-contrast camera, SHARK-NIR, in H-band using a Gaussian coronagraph, and with the LMIRCam instrument in the L'-band and using a vAPP coronagraph. Both observations were conducted simultaneously. Additionally, constraints at short separations from the host star are derived analyzing the renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) values from the Gaia catalogue. We find that the companion responsible for the anomaly signal of HIP 11696 is likely positioned at a distance from 2.5 to 28 astronomical units from its host. Its mass is estimated to be between 4 and 16 Jupiter masses, with the greater mass possible only at the upper end of the separation range. Similar limits were obtained for HIP 47110 where the companion should reside between 3 and 30 au with a mass between 3 and 10 MJup. For HIP 36277, we identified a faint stellar companion at large separation, though it might be substellar depending on the assumed age for the star. Considering the older age, this object accounts for the absolute value of the PMa vector but not for its direction. Additionally, we found a substellar candidate companion at a closer separation that could explain the PMa signal, considering a younger age for the system.

 - **Abstract**
 We have obtained near-infrared ($0.80-2.45\mu$m) spectra of the recurrent nova LMCN 1968-12a on two occasions during its 2024 August eruption. This is the first near-infrared spectroscopy of an extragalactic nova. The initial spectrum, on day 8.48, caught the nova in the coronal phase, with the [SiX] $1.43\mu$m line being extremely strong. This line had a luminosity of $\sim95$L$_\odot$, and is clearly a very powerful coolant. Its presence, together with the absence of [SiIX] 1.56$\mu$m, implies a coronal temperature $\gtrsim3\times10^6$K, possibly amongst the highest recorded coronal temperature in a nova eruption. With the exception of the [SiX] line, the near-infrared spectra are remarkable for being devoid of metal lines. We suggest that this is due, in part, to the exceptionally high temperature of the coronal gas, causing ions, whose emission lines would normally appear in the near-infrared spectrum, to be collisionally ionised to higher stages.

          Investigating Kozai-Lidov Oscillations and Disc Tearing in Be Star Discs

 - **Abstract**
 Recent simulations of Be stars in misaligned binary systems have revealed that misalignment between the disc and binary orbit can cause the disc to undergo Kozai-Lidov (KL) oscillations or disc-tearing. We build on our previous suite of three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of equal-mass systems by simulating eight new misaligned Be star binary systems, with mass-ratios of 0.1 and 0.5, or equal-mass systems with varying viscosity. We find the same phenomena occur as previously for mass ratios of 0.5, while the mass ratio of 0.1 does not cause KL oscillations or disc-tearing for the parameters examined. With increased viscosity in our equal-mass simulations, we show that these phenomena and other oscillations are damped out and do not occur. We also briefly compare two viscosity prescriptions and find they can produce the same qualitative disc evolution. Next, we use the radiative transfer code HDUST to predict observable trends of a KL oscillation, and show how the observables oscillate in sync with disc inclination and cause large changes in the polarization position angle. Our models generate highly complex line profiles, including triple-peak profiles that are known to occur in Be stars. The mapping between the SPH simulations and these triple-peak features gives us hints as to where they originate. Finally, we construct interferometric predictions of how a gap in the disc, produced by KL oscillations or disc-tearing, perturbs the visibility versus baseline curve at multiple wavelengths, and can cause large changes to the differential phase profile across an emission line.

          Time-Frequency Correlation of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts: Correlated Aftershocks Tend to Exhibit Downward Frequency Drifts

 - **Abstract**
 The production mechanism of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains elusive, and potential correlations between burst occurrence times and various burst properties may offer important clues. Among them, the spectral peak frequency is particularly important because it may encode direct information about the physical conditions and environment at the emission site. Analyzing over 4,000 bursts from the three most active sources -- FRB 20121102A, FRB 20201124A, and FRB 20220912A -- we measure the two-point correlation function $\xi(\Delta t, \Delta\nu_{\:\rm peak}\:)$ in the two-dimensional space of time separation $\Delta t$ and peak frequency shift $\Delta\nu_{\:\rm peak}\:$ between burst pairs. We find a universal trend of asymmetry about $\Delta\nu_{\:\rm peak}\:$ at high statistical significance; $\xi(\Delta\nu_{\:\rm peak}\:)$ decreases as $\Delta\nu_{\:\rm peak}\:$ increases from negative to positive values in the region of short time separation ($\Delta t < 0.3$ s), where physically correlated aftershock events produce a strong time correlation signal. This indicates that aftershocks tend to exhibit systematically lower peak frequencies than mainshocks, with this tendency becoming stronger at shorter $\Delta t$. We argue that the "sad trombone effect" -- the downward frequency drift observed among sub-pulses within a single event -- is not confined within a single event but manifests as a statistical nature that extends continuously to independent yet physically correlated aftershocks with time separations up to $\Delta t \sim 0.3$ s. This discovery provides new insights into underlying physical processes of repeater FRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 A recent paper (ref. 1) used infrared images of Io acquired by the Juno/JIRAM instrument to derive a latitudinal dependence of the spectral radiance and conclude that such latitudinal dependence is consistent with a magma ocean model. We challenge their conclusions, and we draw attention to some potential issues with their analysis. In this letter, we will use three arguments to show that: (1) the (ref. 1) paper uses saturated data; (2) the M-filter of the JIRAM imager is only a weak and incomplete proxy for the total power output; and finally (3) even assuming that the radiance was correctly estimated, the latitudinal dependence of the 4.8-$\mu$m spectral radiance is not statistically significant. These facts, taken together, demonstrate that the results presented in (ref. 1) are not sufficient to confirm consistency with a magma ocean model on Io.

 - **Abstract**
 The neutral sodium resonance doublet (Na i D) has been detected in the upper atmosphere of several close-in gas giants, through high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. We aim to investigate whether its variability is linked to the planets' properties, the data quality, or the accuracy of the system parameters used. Using the public code SLOPpy, we extracted the transmission spectrum in the Na i D region of ten gas giants for which a large number of HARPS-N observations are available. We modelled the absorption signals found, performing an MCMC analysis, and converted the measured absorption depth to the corresponding atmospheric height over which most sodium absorption occurs. While two targets (GJ 436 b and KELT-7 b) show no Na i D feature, we found variability in the transmission spectrum of the other targets. Three of them (HD 209458 b, WASP-80 b, and WASP-127 b) present absorption on only some nights, while in the other five targets (HD 189733 b, KELT-9 b, KELT-20 b, WASP-69 b, and WASP-76 b), a significant absorption signal is present on most of the nights analysed. Except for WASP-69 b, the measured absorption depths lead to a ratio of the two Na I D depths that is compatible with or slightly larger than one. As was expected from literature, the relative atmospheric height follows an empirical exponential trend as a function of a scaled product of the planet's equilibrium temperature and surface gravity. We confirm the sodium detection on HD 189733 b, KELT-9 b, KELT-20 b, WASP-69 b, and WASP-76 b. The signal detected in WASP-127 b requires further observations for definitive confirmation. We exclude a planetary origin for the signals found on HD 209458 b and WASP-80 b. The sodium absorption variability does not appear to be related to planetary properties, but rather to data quality, sub-optimal data treatment, or stellar activity.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine images of the protoplanetary disk 114--426 with JWST/NIRCam in 12 bands. This large disk is oriented edge-on with a dark midplane flanked by lobes of scattered light. The outer edges of the midplane are seen in silhouette against the Orion Nebula, providing a unique opportunity to study planet-forming material in absorption. We discover a dip in the scattered light of the disk at 3\,$\micron$ -- compelling evidence for the presence of water ice. The 3\,$\micron$ dip is also seen in the silhouette of the disk, where we quantify the ice abundance with models of pure absorption and avoid the complications of disk scattering effects. We find grain ice-to-refractory mass ratios of up to $\sim$0.2, maximum grain sizes of 0.25 to 5\,$\micron$, and a total dust plus ice mass of 0.46\,$M_\oplus$ in the silhouette region. We also discover excess absorption in the NIRCam bands that include the Paschen $\alpha$ line, suggesting there may be excited atomic hydrogen in the disk. Examining the morphology of the scattered light lobes reveals that they are laterally offset from each other and exhibit a brightness asymmetry that flips with wavelength -- both evidence for a tilted inner disk in this system.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanet atmospheric modeling is advancing from chemically diverse one-dimensional (1D) models to three-dimensional (3D) global circulation models (GCMs), which are crucial for interpreting observations from facilities like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). However, maintaining chemical diversity in models, especially in GCMs, is computationally expensive, limiting their complexity. Optimizing the number of reactions and species can address this tradeoff, but transparent and efficient methods for such optimization are lacking in current exoplanet literature. We aim to develop a systematic approach for reducing chemical networks in exoplanetary atmospheres while balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. Our data-driven method selects optimal reduced chemical networks based on accuracy and computational efficiency metrics. This approach can optimize networks for similar planets simultaneously, assign weights to prioritize accuracy or efficiency, and is applicable when including photochemistry. We base our method on sensitivity analysis of a typical 1D chemical kinetics model, applying principal component analysis to the sensitivities. To achieve fast and reliable network reduction, we utilize a genetic algorithm, a machine-learning optimization method that mimics natural selection. We present three schemes tailored for different priorities (accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability to photochemistry) that demonstrate improved performance and reduced computational costs. Our genetic algorithm-based method, the first to reduce a chemical network including photochemistry in exoplanet research, offers a versatile and efficient approach to enhance both accuracy and computational efficiency.

          Investigating the role of nuclear parameters in Neutron Star oscillations: a model comparison

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies based on the relativistic mean field (RMF) model found certain nuclear empirical parameters, in particular the nucleon effective mass, to be strongly correlated with observable properties of Neutron Stars (NSs), such as the frequencies of $f-$mode oscillations. This shows the potential to constrain the values of effective mass from future observations of $f-$modes. One of our primary goals of this work is to investigate whether such correlations are physical or an artifact of the underlying nuclear model. To test this, we perform a comparative study of the correlations between NS astrophysical observables and nuclear physics parameters using two different equation of state models based on RMF theory and non-relativistic Meta-Modelling (MM) scheme. The nuclear meta-model does not assume any underlying nuclear model and therefore allows us to test the model dependence of the results. The calculations of the $f-$mode characteristics are performed within the relativistic Cowling approximation. We use state-of-the-art nuclear microscopic calculations at low density and multi-messenger astrophysical data at high-density within a Bayesian-inspired scheme to constrain the parameter space of the nuclear models. From the posterior distribution, we probe the underlying correlations among nuclear parameters and with NS observables. We find that the correlation between the symmetry energy and its slope is physical, while that of the nucleon effective mass with NS observables is model-dependent. The study shows that the effective mass governs the high density behaviour in RMF models, while in the MM it is controlled by the higher order saturation parameters, and hence the effective mass in the MM is not correlated with NS observables. The findings of this investigation are interesting both for astrophysics as well as nuclear physics communities.

 - **Abstract**
 The coldest metal-poor population made of T and Y dwarfs are archaeological tracers of our Galaxy because they are very old and have kept the pristine material. The optical properties of these objects are important to characterise their atmospheric properties. We aim at characterising further the optical properties of ultracool metal-poor population with deep far-red optical images and parallax determinations. We solve trigonometric parallaxes of five metal-poor T dwarf candidates using 2-year monitoring with Calar-Alto 3.5-m telescope. We obtain $z'$-band photometry for the other 12 metal-poor T dwarf candidates using the 10.4-m GTC, the 8.2-m VLT, and the DES, increasing the sample of T subdwarfs with optical photometry from 12 to 24. We report a 3-$\sigma$ limit for the Accident in five optical bands using the 10.4-m GTC. We confirm four T subdwarfs and the Accident as a Y subdwarf, and propose two more Y subdwarf candidates. We emphasise that the $z_{PS1}-W1$ colour combining with the $W1-W2$ colour could break the metallicity-temperature degeneracy for T and possibly for Y dwarfs. The $z_{PS1}-W1$ colour shifts redward when metallicity decreases for a certain temperature, which is not predicted by state-of-the-art ultracool models. The Accident has the reddest $z_{PS1}-W1$ colour among our sample. The $z_{PS1}-W1$ colour will be useful to search for other examples of this cold and old population in upcoming and existing deep optical and infrared large-area surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent results from Type Ia Supernovae (SNe), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) indicate 1) potentially discrepant measurements of the matter density $\Omega_m$ and Hubble constant $ H_0 $ in a $\Lambda$CDM model when data are analyzed individually, and 2) hints of dynamical dark energy in a $w_0w_a$CDM model when data are combined in a joint analysis. We examine whether underlying dynamical dark energy cosmologies favored by real data would result in biases in $\Omega_m$ and $ H_0 $ for each probe when analyzed individually in a $\Lambda$CDM framework. We generate mock datasets in $w_0w_a$CDM cosmologies, fit the individual probes under the $\Lambda$CDM model, and find that expected biases in $\Omega_m$ are $\sim 0.03$. Notably, the $\Omega_m$ differences between probes are consistent with the values observed in the real datasets. We also observe that mock DESI BAO datasets generated in the $ w_0w_a $CDM cosmologies will lead to a biased measurement of $ H_0 $ higher by ($\sim1.2$km/s/Mpc) when fitted under $\Lambda$CDM, appearing to mildly improve the Hubble tension, but as the true underlying $H_0$ is lower, the tension is in fact worsened. We find that the $\Omega_m$ discrepancies, the high BAO $ H_0 $ relative to CMB, and the joint dynamical dark energy signal itself are all related effects that could be explained simultaneously with either new physics or new systematics. While we find it is possible to unite many of the discrepancies seen in recent analyses along a single axis, our results underscore the importance of understanding systematic differences in datasets, as they have unique impacts in different cosmological parameter spaces.

          From Misaligned Sub-Saturns to Aligned Brown Dwarfs: The Highest $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ Systems Exhibit Low Obliquities, Even around Hot Stars

 - **Abstract**
 We present a pattern emerging from stellar obliquity measurements in single-star systems: planets with high planet-to-star mass ratios ($M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$$>$ $2\times10^{-3}$) -- such as super-Jupiters, brown dwarf companions, and M-dwarfs hosting Jupiter-like planets -- tend to be aligned, even around hot stars. This alignment represents a 3.7$\sigma$ deviation from the obliquity distribution observed in systems with lower mass ratios ($M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$$<$ $2\times10^{-3}$), which predominantly include Jupiters and sub-Saturns. The only known outlier system, XO-3, exhibits misalignment confirmed via our newly collected Rossiter-McLaughlin effect measurement ($\lambda=41.8^{+2.1}_{-2.0}$ degrees). However, the relatively large $\textit{Gaia}$ Renormalized Unit Weight Error (RUWE) of XO-3 suggests that it may harbor an undetected binary companion, potentially contributing to its misalignment. Given that tidal realignment mechanisms are weak for hot stars, the observed alignment in high $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems is likely $\textit{primordial}$ rather than resulting from tidal interactions. One possible explanation is that only dynamically isolated planets can continue accreting gas and evolve into super-Jupiters while maintaining their primordial alignment. Conversely, planets formed in compact configurations may be unable to grow beyond the gap-opening mass, for which our work suggests an empirical boundary $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$$=$ $2\times10^{-3}$, identified between aligned high $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems and misaligned low $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems, with dynamical instabilities contributing to the diverse spin-orbit misalignments observed in the latter.
