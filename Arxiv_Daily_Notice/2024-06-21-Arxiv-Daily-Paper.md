 - **Abstract**
 We select blue-horizontal branch stars (BHBs) from the internal data release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program to reveal the global structure of the Milky Way (MW) stellar halo. The data are distributed over $\sim 1,100$~deg$^2$ area in the range of $18.5<g<24.5$~mag, so that candidate BHBs are detectable over a Galactocentric radius of $r \simeq 36-575$~kpc. In order to select most likely BHBs by removing blue straggler stars and other contaminants in a statistically significant manner, we develop and apply an extensive Bayesian method, as described in \citet{Fukushima2019}. Our sample can be fitted to either a single power-law profile with an index of $\alpha=4.11^{+0.18}_{-0.18}$ or a broken power-law profile with an index of $\alpha_{\rm in}=3.90^{+0.24}_{-0.30}$ at $r$ below a broken radius of $r_{\rm b}=184^{+118}_{-66}$ kpc and a very steep slope of $\alpha_{\rm out}=9.1^{+6.8}_{-3.6}$ at $r>r_{\rm b}$; the statistical difference between these fitting profiles is small. Both profiles are found to show prolate shapes having axial ratios of $q=1.47^{+0.30}_{-0.33}$ and $1.56^{+0.34}_{-0.23}$, respectively. We also find a signature of the so-called "splashback radius" for the candidate BHBs, which can reach as large as $r \sim 575$~kpc, although it is still inconclusive owing to rather large distance errors in this faintest end of the sample. Our results suggest that the MW stellar halo consists of the two overlapping components: the {\it in situ} inner halo showing a relatively steep radial density profile and the {\it ex situ} outer halo with a shallower profile, being characteristic of a component formed from accretion of small stellar systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the role of primordial black holes (PBHs) as potential dark matter (DM) candidates, particularly focusing on light asteroid-mass PBHs. These PBHs are expected to emit particles through Hawking evaporation that can generate cosmic rays (CRs), eventually producing other secondary radiations through their propagation in the Milky Way, in addition to prompt emissions. Here, we perform a comprehensive analysis of CR signals resulting from PBH evaporation, incorporating the full CR transport to account for reacceleration and diffusion effects within the Milky Way. In particular, we revisit the $e^\pm$ flux produced by PBHs, using Voyager 1, and study for the first time the diffuse X-ray emission from the up-scattering of Galactic ambient photons due to PBH-produced $e^\pm$ via the inverse Compton effect using XMM-Newton data, as well as the morphological information of the diffuse 511 keV line measured by INTEGRAL/SPI. In doing so, we provide leading constraints on the fraction of DM that can be in form of PBHs in a conservative way, whilst also testing how different assumptions on spin and mass distributions affect our conclusions.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have made tremendous progress and are now showing strong evidence for the gravitational-wave background (GWB). Further probing the origin and characteristics of the GWB will require more generalized analysis techniques. Bayesian methods are most often used but can be computationally expensive. On the other hand, frequentist methods, like the PTA Optimal Statistic (OS), are more computationally efficient and can produce results that are complementary to Bayesian methods, allowing for stronger statistical cases to be built from a confluence of different approaches. In this work we expand the capabilities of the OS through a technique we call the Per-Frequency Optimal Statistic (PFOS). The PFOS removes the underlying power-law assumption inherent in previous implementations of the OS, and allows one to estimate the GWB spectrum in a frequency-by-frequency manner. We have also adapted a recent generalization from the OS pipeline into the PFOS, making it capable of accurately characterizing the spectrum in the intermediate and strong GW signal regimes using only a small fraction of the necessary computational resources when compared with fully-correlated Bayesian methods, while also empowering many new types of analyses not possible before. We find that even in the strong GW signal regime, where the GWB dominates over noise in all frequencies, the injected value of the signal lies within the 50th-percentile of the PFOS uncertainty distribution in 41-45% of simulations, remaining 3$\sigma$-consistent with unbiased estimation.

 - **Abstract**
 It is well established that maximizing the information extracted from upcoming and ongoing stage-IV weak-lensing surveys requires higher-order summary statistics that complement the standard two-point statistics. In this work, we focus on weak-lensing peak statistics to test two popular modified gravity models, $f(R)$ and nDGP, using the FORGE and BRIDGE weak-lensing simulations, respectively. From these simulations we measure the peak statistics as a function of both cosmological and modified gravity parameters simultaneously. Our findings indicate that the peak abundance is sensitive to the strength of modified gravity, while the peak two-point correlation function is sensitive to the nature of the screening mechanism in a modified gravity model. We combine these simulated statistics with a Gaussian Process Regression emulator and a Gaussian likelihood to generate stage-IV forecast posterior distributions for the modified gravity models. We demonstrate that, in a systematics-free case, peak statistics can constrain $\log_{10}(f_{R0}) = -6$ to 2% precision, and $\log_{10}(H_0 r_c) = 0.5$ to 25% precision. Finally, we find that our weakest models, $\log_{10}(f_{R0})$ < 6.17 and $\log_{10}(H_0 r_c)$ > 1, can be ruled out at the two sigma level with an area of $300 \rm{deg}^2$ and $1000 \rm{deg}^2$, respectively, with the upcoming stage-IV data.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the links between different phases of outflows from active galactic nuclei is a key goal in extragalactic astrophysics. Here we compare [OIII] $\lambda\lambda$4960,5008 outflow signatures in quasars with and without Broad Absorption Lines (BALs), aiming to test how the broad absorption troughs seen in the rest-frame ultraviolet are linked to the narrow line region outflows seen in the rest-frame optical. We present new near-infrared spectra from Magellan/FIRE which cover [OIII] in 12 quasars with 2.1 < z < 2.3, selected to have strong outflow signatures in CIV $\lambda$1550. Combining with data from the literature, we build a sample of 73 BAL, 115 miniBAL and 125 non-BAL QSOs with 1.5 < z < 2.6. The strength and velocity width of [OIII] correlate strongly with the CIV emission properties, but no significant difference is seen in the [OIII] emission-line properties between the BALs, non-BALs and miniBALs once the dependence on CIV emission is taken into account. A weak correlation is observed between the velocities of CIV BALs and [OIII] emission, which is accounted for by the fact that both outflow signatures correlate with the underlying CIV emission properties. Our results add to the growing evidence that BALs and non-BALs are drawn from the same parent population and are consistent with a scenario wherein BAL troughs are intermittent tracers of persistent quasar outflows, with a part of such outflow becoming optically thick along our line-of-sight for sporadic periods of time within which BALs are observed.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) are of unknown origin, even though they have traditionally been connected to supernovae due to energetic arguments. In the last decades, Galactic black holes in X-ray binaries (BHXBs) have been proposed as candidate sources of CRs revising the CR paradigm. BHXBs launch two relativistic jets during outbursts, but recent observations suggest that such jets may be launched even during quiescence. A0620-00 is such a well-studied object that shows hints of jet emission. In this work, we study the simultaneous radio-to-X-ray spectrum detected from this source while in quiescence to better constrain the jet dynamics. Given that the majority of BHXBs spend their lifetime in quiescence (qBHXBs), we use the jet dynamics of A0620-00 to study a population of 100000 such sources distributed throughout the Galactic disc, and a further 10000 located in the Boxy Bulge around the Galactic centre. While the contribution to the CR spectrum is suppressed, we find that the cumulative intrinsic emission of qBHXBs from both the Boxy Bulge and the Galactic disc adds to the diffuse emission that various facilities detect from radio to TeV gamma rays. We examine the contribution of qBHXBs to the Galactic diffuse emission and investigate the possibility of SKA, INTEGRAL and CTAO to detect individual sources in the future. Finally, we compare the predicted neutrino flux to the recently presented Galactic diffuse neutrino emission by IceCube.

          Advancing Stellar Streams as a Dark Matter Probe -- I: Evolution of the CDM subhalo population

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar streams, long thin streams of stars, have been used as sensitive probes of dark matter substructure for over two decades. Gravitational interactions between dark matter substructures and streams lead to the formation of low density "gaps" in streams, with any given stream typically containing no more than a few such gaps. Prior models for the statistics of such gaps have relied on several simplifying assumptions for the properties of the subhalo population in the cold dark matter scenario. With the expected forthcoming increase in the number of streams, and gaps, observed, in this work we develop a more detailed model for the statistics of subhalos interacting with streams, and test some of the assumptions made in prior works. Instead of using simple fits to N-body estimates of subhalo population statistics at z = 0 as in previous work, we make use of realizations of time-dependent subhalo populations generated from a fully physical model, incorporating structure formation, and subhalo orbital evolution, including tidal heating and stripping physics, which has been carefully calibrated to match results of cosmological N-body simulations. We find that this model predicts up to 60% more gaps on average in Pal-5-like streams than prior works.

 - **Abstract**
 We simulate a variety of optical systematics for Taurus, a balloon-borne cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarisation experiment, to assess their impact on large-scale E-mode polarisation measurements and constraints of the optical depth to reionisation {\tau}. We model a one-month flight of Taurus from Wanaka, New Zealand aboard a super-pressure balloon (SPB). We simulate night-time scans of both the CMB and dust foregrounds in the 150GHz band, one of Taurus's four observing bands. We consider a variety of possible systematics that may affect Taurus's observations, including non-gaussian beams, pointing reconstruction error, and half-wave plate (HWP) non-idealities. For each of these, we evaluate the residual power in the difference between maps simulated with and without the systematic, and compare this to the expected signal level corresponding to Taurus's science goals. Our results indicate that most of the HWP-related systematics can be mitigated to be smaller than sample variance by calibrating with Planck's TT spectrum and using an achromatic HWP model, with a preference for five layers of sapphire to ensure good systematic control. However, additional beam characterization will be required to mitigate far-sidelobe pickup from dust on larger scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first X-ray spectropolarimetric results for Cygnus X-1 in its soft state from a campaign of five IXPE observations conducted during 2023 May-June. Companion multiwavelength data during the campaign are likewise shown. The 2-8 keV X-rays exhibit a net polarization degree PD=1.99%+/-0.13% (68% confidence). The polarization signal is found to increase with energy across IXPE's 2-8 keV bandpass. The polarized X-rays exhibit an energy-independent polarization angle of PA=-25.7+/-1.8 deg. East of North (68% confidence). This is consistent with being aligned to Cyg X-1's AU-scale compact radio jet and its pc-scale radio lobes. In comparison to earlier hard-state observations, the soft state exhibits a factor of 2 lower polarization degree, but a similar trend with energy and a similar (also energy-independent) position angle. When scaling by the natural unit of the disk temperature, we find the appearance of a consistent trendline in the polarization degree between soft and hard states. Our favored polarimetric model indicates Cyg X-1's spin is likely high (a* above ~0.96). The substantial X-ray polarization in Cyg X-1's soft state is most readily explained as resulting from a large portion of X-rays emitted from the disk returning and reflecting off the disk surface, generating a high polarization degree and a polarization direction parallel to the black hole spin axis and radio jet. In IXPE's bandpass, the polarization signal is dominated by the returning reflection emission. This constitutes polarimetric evidence for strong gravitational lensing of X-rays close to the black hole.

          C/O Ratios and the formation of wide separation exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 The gas and solid-state C/O ratios provide context to potentially link the atmospheric composition of planets to that of the natal disk. We provide a synthesis of extant estimates of the gaseous C/O and C/H ratios in planet-forming disks obtained primarily through analysis of Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations. These estimates are compared to atmospheric abundances of wide separation (> 10 au) gas giants. The resolved disk gas C/O ratios, from seven systems, generally exhibit C/O > 1 with sub-solar, or depleted, carbon content. In contrast, wide separation gas giants have atmospheric C/O ratios that cluster near or slightly above the presumed stellar value with a range of elemental C/H. From the existing disk composition, we infer that the solid-state mm/cm-sized pebbles have a total C/O ratio (solid cores and ices) that is solar (stellar) in content. We explore simple models that reconstruct the exoplanet atmospheric composition from the disk, while accounting for silicate cloud formation in the planet atmosphere. If wide separate planets formed via the core-accretion mechanism, they must acquire their metals from pebble or planetesimal accretion. Further, the dispersion in giant planet C/H content is best matched by a disk composition with modest and variable factors of carbon depletion. An origin of the wide separation gas giants via gravitational instability cannot be ruled out as stellar C/O ratios should natively form in this scenario. However, the variation in planet metallicity with a stellar C/O ratio potentially presents challenges to these models.

          The XMM-Newton and NuSTAR view of IRASF11119+3257. I Detection of multiple UFO components and a very cold corona

 - **Abstract**
 IRASF11119 is an ultra-luminous IR galaxy with post-merger morphology, hosting a type-1 QSO at z=0.189. Its 2013 Suzaku spectrum shows a prominent Ultra Fast Outflow (UFO) absorption feature (v_out~0.25c). In 2021, we obtained the first XMM-Newton long look of the target, coordinated with a simultaneous NuSTAR observation. The new high-quality data allow us to detect at P>99.8% c.l. multiple absorption features associated with the known UFO. Furthermore, an emission plus absorption feature at 1.1-1.3 keV reveals the presence of a blueshifted P-Cygni profile in the soft band. We associate the hard band features with blends of FeXXV and FeXXVI He$\alpha$-Ly$\alpha$ and He$\beta$-Ly$\beta$ line pairs and infer a large column (N$_H$~$10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) of highly ionized (log$\xi$~5) gas outflowing at v_out=0.27c. The 1 keV feature can be associated with a blend of Fe and Ne transitions, produced by a lower column (N$_H$~$10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$) and ionization (log$\xi$~2.6) gas component outflowing at the same speed. Using a radiative-transfer disk wind model to fit the highly ionized UFO, we derive a large mass outflow rate, comparable with the mass accretion rate (M$_{out}$=4.25 M$_{Sun}$/yr, ~1.6 M$_{acc}$), and kinetic energy and momentum flux among the highest reported in the literature. We measure an extremely low high-energy cut-off (E$_c$~25 keV). Several other cases in the literature suggest that a steep X-ray continuum may be related to the formation of powerful winds. The lack of a significant momentum boost between the nuclear UFO and the different phases of the large-scale outflow, observed in IRASF11119 and in a growing number of sources with powerful UFOs, can be explained by (i) a momentum-driven expansion, (ii) an inefficient coupling of the UFO with the host ISM, or (iii) by repeated energy-driven expansion episodes with low duty-cycle, that average out on long time-scales.

          Precisely Measuring the Cosmic Reionization History from IGM Damping Wings Towards Quasars

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a new approach for analyzing the IGM damping wings imprinted on the proximity zones of quasars in the epoch of reionization (EoR). Whereas past work has typically forgone the additional constraining power afforded by the blue side continuum ($1216\,Å \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 1280\,Å$) and/or opted not to model the large correlated IGM transmission fluctuations in the proximity zone ($\lambda \lesssim 1216\,Å$), we construct a generative probabilistic model for the entire spectrum accounting for all sources of error - the stochasticity induced by patchy reionization, the impact of the quasar's ionizing radiation on the IGM, the unknown intrinsic spectrum of the quasar, and spectral noise. This principled Bayesian method allows us to marginalize out nuisance parameters associated with the quasar's radiation and its unknown intrinsic spectrum to precisely measure the IGM neutral fraction, $\langle x_{\rm HI}\rangle$. A key element of our analysis is the use of dimensionality reduction (DR) to describe the intrinsic quasar spectrum via a small number of nuisance parameters. Using a large sample of $15,559$ SDSS/BOSS quasars at $z \gtrsim 2.15$ we trained and quantified the performance of six distinct DR methods, and find that a six parameter PCA model (five coefficients plus a normalization) performs best, with complex machine learning approaches providing no advantage. By conducting statistical inference on 100 realistic mock EoR quasar spectra, we demonstrate the reliability of the credibility contours that we obtain on $\langle x_{\rm HI}\rangle$ and the quasar lifetime, $t_{\rm Q}$. The new method introduced here will transform IGM damping wings into a precision probe of reionization, on the same solid methodological and statistical footing as other precision cosmological measurements.

          Quantifying the Precision of IGM Damping Wing Measurements Towards Quasars

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the precision with which the Lyman-$\alpha$ damping wing signature imprinted on the spectra of high-redshift quasars (QSOs) by the foreground neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) can measure the history of cosmic reionization. We leverage a novel inference pipeline based on a generative probabilistic model for the entire spectrum (both red- and blueward of the Lyman-$\alpha$ line), accounting for all relevant sources of uncertainty - the stochasticity caused by patchy reionization, the impact of the quasar's ionizing radiation on the IGM, it's unknown intrinsic spectrum, and spectral noise. Performing fast JAX-based Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo (HMC) parameter inference, we precisely measure the underlying global IGM neutral fraction as well as the lifetime of the quasar. Running a battery of tests on over a thousand mocks, we find optimal precision when running the pipeline with a six parameter PCA continuum model (five coefficients and a normalization) on $\mathrm{S}/\mathrm{N} \sim 10$ spectra, binned to a $\sim 500\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ velocity pixel scale, and extending at least out to the C IV $\lambda\,1549\,\text{Å}$ emission line. After marginalizing out nuisance parameters associated with the quasar continuum, a single spectrum constrains the IGM neutral fraction to $28.0_{-8.8}^{+8.2}\,\%$ and the quasar lifetime to $0.80_{-0.55}^{+0.22}\,\mathrm{dex}$, improving notably towards spectra with a stronger IGM damping wing imprint. Higher precision can be achieved by averaging over statistical quasar samples. We identify two primary sources of uncertainty that contribute approximately equally to the total error budget: the uncertain quasar continuum model and the stochastic distribution of neutral regions arising from both the reionization topology and the location of the quasar's ionization front.

          Inversion for Inferring Solar Meridional Circulation: The Case with Constraints on Angular Momentum Transport inside the Sun

 - **Abstract**
 We have carried out inversions of travel times as measured by Gizon et al. (2020) to infer the internal profile of the solar meridional circulation (MC). A linear inverse problem has been solved by the regularized least-squares method with a constraint that the angular momentum (AM) transport by MC should be equatorward (HK21-type constraint). Our motivation for using this constraint is based on the result by Hotta and Kusano (2021) where the solar equator-fast rotation was reproduced successfully without any manipulation. The inversion result indicates that the MC profile is a double-cell structure if the so-called HK21 regime, in which AM transported by MC sustains the equator-fast rotation, correctly describes the physics inside the solar convective zone. The sum of the squared residuals computed with the inferred double-cell MC profile is comparable to that computed with the single-cell MC profile obtained when we exclude the HK21-type constraint, showing that both profiles can explain the data more or less at the same level. However, we also find that adding the HK21-type constraint degrades the resolution of the averaging kernels. Although it is difficult for us to determine the large-scale morphology of the solar MC at the moment, our attempt highlights the relevance of investigating the solar MC profile from both theoretical and observational perspectives.

 Observations of the cosmic microwave backgroundradiation are described to remarkable accuracy by the six-parameterLambda CDM cosmology. However, the key ingredients of this model, namely dark matter, dark energy and cosmic inflation are not understood at a fundamental level. It is therefore important to investigate tensions between the CMB and other cosmological probes. I will review aspects of tensions with direct measurements of the Hubble constant H_0, measurements of weak gravitational lensing, and the recent hints of evolving dark energy reported by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration.

 - **Abstract**
 We measure the high-mass stellar initial mass function (IMF) from resolved stars in M33 young stellar clusters. Leveraging \textit{Hubble Space Telescope's} high resolving power, we fully model the IMF probabilistically. We first model the optical CMD of each cluster to constrain its power-law slope $\Gamma$, marginalized over other cluster parameters in the fit (e.g., cluster age, mass, and radius). We then probabilistically model the distribution of MF slopes for a highly strict cluster sample of 9 clusters more massive than log(Mass/M$_{\odot}$)=3.6; above this mass, all clusters have well-populated main sequences of massive stars and should have accurate recovery of their MF slopes, based on extensive tests with artificial clusters. We find the ensemble IMF is best described by a mean high-mass slope of $\overline{\Gamma} = 1.49\pm0.18$, with an intrinsic scatter of $\sigma^{2}_{\Gamma} = 0.02^{+0.16}_{0.00}$, consistent with a universal IMF. We find no dependence of the IMF on environmental impacts such as the local star formation rate or galactocentric radius within M33, which serves as a proxy for metallicity. This $\overline{\Gamma}$ measurement is consistent with similar measurements in M31, despite M33 having a much higher star formation rate intensity. While this measurement is formally consistent with the canonical Kroupa ($\Gamma = 1.30$) IMF, as well as the Salpeter ($\Gamma = 1.35)$) value, it is the second Local Group cluster sample to show evidence for a somewhat steeper high-mass IMF slope. We explore the impacts a steeper IMF slope has on a number of astronomical sub-fields.

 - **Abstract**
 We estimate the absolute age of the globular cluster NGC 3201 using $10,000$ sets of theoretical isochrones constructed through Monte Carlo simulation using the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Program. These isochrones take into consideration of uncertainty introduced by the choice of stellar evolution parameters. We fit isochrones with 3 detached eclipsing binaries and obtained an age independent of distance. We also fit isochrones with differential reddening corrected HST photometry data utilizing two different Hess diagram based fitting methods. Results from 3 different methods analyzing 2 different types of data agree to within $1 \sigma$, and we find the absolute age of NGC 3201 $= 11.85 \pm 0.74$ Gyr. We also perform variable importance analysis to study the uncertainty contribution from individual parameters and we find the distance is the dominance source of uncertainty in photometry based analysis while total metallicity, Helium abundance, $\alpha$-element abundance, mixing length, and treatment of helium diffusion are important source of uncertainties for all 3 methods.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the scintillation velocity measurements of FRB~20201124A from the FAST observations, which reveal an annual variation. This annual variation is further supported by changes detected in the scintillation arc as observed from the secondary spectrum. We attribute the annual velocity variation to the presence of a moderately anisotropic scattering screen located at a distance of 0.4$\pm$0.1~kpc from Earth. Our results prove that the scintillation of this FRB is mainly caused by material close to Earth on a Galactic scale. However, scintillation observations of other FRBs may expose their surrounding environment or uncover possible orbital motion if scintillation is caused by materials in their host galaxy.

          The Distribution of Planet Radius in Kepler Multiplanet Systems Depends on Gap Complexity

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of small planet radius ($<$4 R$_\oplus$) is an indicator of the underlying processes governing planet formation and evolution. We investigate the correlation between the radius distribution of exoplanets in Kepler multiplanet systems and the system-level complexity in orbital period spacing. Utilizing a sample of 234 planetary systems with three or more candidate planets orbiting FGK main-sequence stars, we measure the gap complexity ($C$) to characterize the regularity of planetary spacing and compare it with other measures of period spacing and spacing uniformity. We find that systems with higher gap complexity exhibit a distinct radius distribution compared to systems with lower gap complexity. Specifically, we find that the radius valley, which separates super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, is more pronounced in systems with lower gap complexity ($C$$<$0.165). Planets in high complexity systems ($C$$>$0.35) exhibit a lower frequency of sub-Earths (2.5 times less) and sub-Neptunes (1.3 times less) and a higher frequency of super-Earths (1.4 times more) than planets in low complexity systems. This may suggest that planetary systems with more irregular spacings are more likely to undergo dynamic interactions that influence planet scattering, composition, and atmospheric retention. The gap complexity metric proves to be a valuable tool in linking the physical characteristics of planets to their orbital configurations.

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of state-of-the-art space-borne telescopes, high-resolution ground-based observation has emerged as a crucial method for characterizing exoplanets, providing essential insights into their atmospheric compositions. In the optical and NIR regions, high-resolution spectroscopy has been powerful for hot Jupiters (HJ) and ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJ) during their primary transits, as it can probe molecules with better sensitivity. Here, we focus on a comparative simulation study of WASP-76 b (UHJ) and WASP-77 A b (HJ) for different number of transits, utilizing three ground-based spectrographs (GIANO-B (TNG), CARMENES (CAHA), and ANDES (E-ELT)) with varying instrumental parameters, spectral coverages, and resolutions. We aim to evaluate the feasibility of the upcoming ground-based European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) in probing molecules from planet atmospheres and how it surpasses other ground-based observatories in terms of detectability. With the 1-D model, petitCODE, we have self-consistently simulated the atmospheric pressure-temperature profiles, which are subsequently integrated into the 1-D chemical kinetics model, VULCAN, to evolve the atmospheric chemistry. High-resolution spectra are obtained by performing line-by-line radiative transfer using petitRADTRANS. Finally, we use the resulting spectra to assess the detectability (sigma_det) of molecular bands, employing the ground-based noise simulator SPECTR. Utilizing cross-correlation spectroscopy, we have successfully demonstrated the robust consistency between our simulation study and real-time observations for both planets. ANDES excels overall in molecular detection due to its enhanced instrumental architecture, reinforcing E-ELT's importance for studying exoplanet atmospheres. Additionally, our theoretical simulations predict the detection of CO, NH3, and H2S on WASP-76 b atmosphere with a sigma_det> 3.

 - **Abstract**
 Planet formation models are necessary to understand the origins of diverse planetary systems. Circumstellar disc substructures have been proposed as preferred locations of planet formation but a complete formation scenario has not been covered by a single model so far. We aim to study the formation of giant planets facilitated by disc substructure and starting with sub-micron-sized dust. We connect dust coagulation and drift, planetesimal formation, $N$-body gravity, pebble accretion, planet migration, planetary gas accretion and gap opening in one consistent modelling framework. We find rapid formation of multiple gas giants from the initial disc substructure. The migration trap near the substructure allows the formation of cold gas giants. A new pressure maximum is created at the outer edge of the planetary gap, which triggers the next generation of planet formation resulting in a compact chain of giant planets. A high planet formation efficiency is achieved as the first gas giants are effective in preventing dust from drifting further inwards, which preserves materials for planet formation. Sequential planet formation is a promising framework to explain the formation of chains of gas and ice giants.

 - **Abstract**
 Several sources of repeating coherent bursts of radio emission with periods of many minutes have now been reported in the literature. These ``ultra-long period'' (ULP) sources have no clear multi-wavelength counterparts and challenge canonical pulsar emission models, leading to debate regarding their nature. In this work we report the discovery of a bright, highly-polarised burst of radio emission at low Galactic latitude as part of a wide-field survey for transient and variable radio sources. ASKAP\,J175534.9$-$252749.1 does not appear to repeat, with only a single intense two-minute $\sim 200$\,mJy burst detected from 60~hours of observations. The burst morphology and polarisation properties are comparable to those of classical pulsars but the duration is more than one hundred times longer, analogous to ULPs. No comparable bursts are detected in the rest of our widefield survey to date. Combined with the existing ULP population, this suggests that these sources have a strong Galactic latitude dependence and hints at an unexplored population of transient and variable radio sources in the thin disk of the Milky Way. The resemblance of this burst with both ULPs and pulsars calls for a unified coherent emission model for objects with spin periods from milliseconds to tens of minutes. However, whether or not these are all neutron stars or have the same underlying power source remains open for debate.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the ultimate goals of the ESA Ariel space mission is to shed light on the formation pathways and evolution of planetary systems in the Solar neighbourhood. Such an endeavour is only possible by performing a large chemical survey of not only the planets, but also their host stars, inasmuch as stellar elemental abundances are the cipher key to decode the planetary compositional signatures. This work aims at providing homogeneous abundances of C, N, and O of a sample of 181 stars belonging to the Tier 1 of the Ariel Mission Candidate Sample. We applied the spectral synthesis and the equivalent width methods to a variety of atomic and molecular indicators (C I lines at 5052 and 5380.3 A, [O I] forbidden line at 6300.3 A, C_2 bands at 5128 and 5165 A, and CN band at 4215 A) using high-resolution and high S/N spectra collected with several spectrographs. We provide carbon abundances for 180 stars, nitrogen abundances for 105 stars, and oxygen abundances for 89 stars. We analyse the results in the light of the Galactic chemical evolution, and in terms of the planetary companions properties. Our sample basically follows the typical trends with metallicity expected for the [C/Fe], [N/Fe], and [O/Fe] abundance ratios. The fraction between C and O abundances, both yields of primary production, is consistent with a constant ratio as [O/H] increases, whereas the abundance of N tends to increase with the increasing of the O abundance, supporting the theoretical assumption of a secondary production of nitrogen. The [C/N], [C/O], and [N/O] ratios are also correlated with [Fe/H], which might introduce biases in the interpretation of the planetary compositions and formation histories if host stars of different metallicity are compared. We provide relations that can be used to qualitatively estimate whether the atmospheric composition of planets is enriched or not with respect to the host stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary mass transfer can occur at high rates due to rapid expansion of the donor's envelope. In the case where mass transfer is unstable, the binary can rapidly shrink its orbit and lead to a merger. In this work we consider the appearance of the system preceding merger, specifically for the case of a low-mass ($\approx 2.5$-$3~M_\odot$) helium star with a neutron star (NS) companion. Modeling the mass transfer history as well as the wind launched by super-Eddington accretion onto the NS, we find that such systems can power slowly rising transients with timescales as long as years, and luminosities of $\sim 10^{40}$-$10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ from optical to UV. The final explosion following the merger (or core-collapse of the helium star in some cases) leads to an interaction-powered transient with properties resembling Type Ibn supernovae (SNe), possibly with a bright early peak powered by shock cooling emission for merger-powered explosions. We apply our model to the Type Ibn SN 2023fyq, that displayed a long-term precursor activity from years before the terminal explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the $Insight$-HXMT archival data, we have detected a new atypical low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (LFQPO) in the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348$-$630. The new LFQPO is detected in all the three instruments of $Insight$-HXMT with a combined significance of 3--5 $\sigma$, covering a wide energy range of 1--100 keV. The fractional root-mean-square (RMS) seems decrease with energy. It exclusively appears in the hard state during both the main and mini outburst, spanning an X-ray intensity range by a factor of 10, and a very narrow hardness range. The frequency of this new type of LFQPO is moderately stable, in the range of 0.08--0.15 Hz. We discussed different models for the LFQPO, and found none is able to explain the observed properties of this new type of LFQPO.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The current algorithms used for the calibration and analysis of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) networks that only use linear polarizers (as is the case of the VLBI Global Observing System, VGOS) do not properly account for instrumental and source-intrinsic polarimetry, which can cause errors in geodetic and astronomical products. Aims. We aim to develop a calibration pipeline for VLBI interferometers that observe in a basis of linear polarization, as is the case of VGOS. The products from this pipeline can be used to obtain valuable full-polarization astronomical information from the observed sources, and they can be used to potentially improve the geodetic results. Methods. We used the algorithm PolConvert to write the correlation products in a basis of circular polarization that is compatible with the standard VLBI calibration procedures. In addition to this, we implemented a wide-band global fringe-fitting algorithm that accounts for dispersive effects (ionospheric delay) and allows us to perform full-polarization imaging of all the observed sources, covering the whole frequency band of VGOS. Results. We present the outcome of our pipeline applied to a global IVS VGOS epoch of observations and show example imaging results in total intensity and polarization. We also discuss issues encountered during the analysis and suggest points of improvement in the VGOS system for an optimum geodetic and astronomical exploitation of this interferometer.

          Transformer models for astrophysical time series and the GRB prompt-afterglow relation

 - **Abstract**
 Transformer models have recently become very successful in the natural language domain. Their value as sequence-to-sequence translators there, also makes them a highly interesting technique for learning relationships between astrophysical time series. Our aim is investigate how well such a transformer neural network can establish causal temporal relations between different channels of a single-source signal. We thus apply a transformer model to the two phases of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), reconstructing one phase from the other. GRBs are unique instances where a single process and event produces two distinct time variable phenomena: the prompt emission and the afterglow. We here investigate if a transformer model can predict the afterglow flux from the prompt emission. If successful, such a predictive scheme might then be distilled to the most important underlying physics drivers in the future. We combine the transformer model with a novel dense neural network setup to directly estimate the starting value of the prediction. We find that the transformer model can, in some instances, successfully predict different phases of canonical afterglows, including the plateau phase. Hence it is a useful and promising new astrophysical analysis technique. For the GRB test case, the method marginally exceeds the baseline model overall, but still achieves accurate recovery of the prompt-afterglow fluence-fluence correlation in reconstructed light curves. Despite this progress, we conclude that consistent improvement over the baseline model is not yet achieved for the GRB case. We discuss the future improvements in data and modeling that are required to identify new physical-relation parameters or new insights into the single process driving both GRB phases.

 - **Abstract**
 We explored the impact that Doppler dimming and brightening effects from bulk motions of solar prominences have on the formation of Lya, Ha, and MgII h line profiles. We compared two schemes in which these effects manifest; when the prominence is moving radially away from the solar surface (radial case), and when the prominence is moving parallel to the solar surface (horizontal case). To do this, we analysed 13,332 model profiles generated through the use of the 1D NLTE (i.e. departures from Local Thermodynamic equilibrium) radiative transfer (RT) code Promweaver, built on the Lightweaver NLTE RT framework to mimic the behaviour and output of the 1D NLTE RT code PROM. We found that horizontal velocities are just as, or more important than radial velocities. This demonstrates that horizontal velocities need to be accounted for when attempting to do any sort of forward modelling.

 - **Abstract**
 We accurately identify and classify the variability of A-F stars in the southern continuous viewing zone of the TESS satellite. The brightness limit was set to 10 mag to ensure the utmost reliability of our results and allow for spectroscopic follow-up observations using small telescopes. We aim to compare our findings with existing catalogues of variable stars. The light curves from TESS and their Fourier transform were used to manually classify stars in our sample. Cross-matching with other catalogues was performed to identify contaminants and false positives. We have identified 1171 variable stars (51 % of the sample). Among these variable stars, 67 % have clear classifications, which includes $\delta$ Sct and $\gamma$ Dor pulsating stars and their hybrids, rotationally variables, and eclipsing binaries. We have provided examples of the typical representatives of variable stars and discussed the ambiguous cases. We found 20 pairs of stars with the same frequencies and identified the correct source of the variations. Additionally, we found that the variations in 12 other stars are caused by the contamination with the light of faint nearby large-amplitude variable stars. To compare our sample with other variable star catalogues, we have defined two parameters reflecting the agreement in identification of variable stars and their classification. This comparison reveals intriguing disagreements in classification ranging from 52 % to 100 %. However, if we assume that stars without specific types are only marked as variable, then the agreement is relatively good, ranging from 57 % to 85 % (disagreement 15-43 %). We have demonstrated that the TESS classification is superior to the classification based on other photometric surveys. The classification of stellar variability is complex and requires careful consideration. Caution should be exercised when using catalogue classifications.

          Formation of the Supersonic Stellar Wind: Parker's Theory Revisited

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the classical theory of stellar wind formation. The theory requires that to form a supersonic stellar wind, a subsonic flow speed must start at a specific initial speed from the coronal base, called eigenspeed, go along a continuous eigenfunction, and reach the sonic point, which is where the flow speed equals the sonic speed, while the critical condition, which is where the effective driving force is zero, is satisfied. Any mismatch between the sonic point and critical condition distances results in either subsonic winds when the initial speed is below the eigenspeed, or no stellar wind when the initial speed is above the eigenspeed. However, because the critical condition is determined by the stellar wind temperature profile, which depends on ionization process at the top of the chromosphere and the heating process around the coronal base but not by the processes at the sonic point, the requirement of sonic point satisfying the critical condition is generally not met and hence the momentum equation in the conventional theory encounters difficulty when the initial speed is above the eigenspeed. To resolve the difficulty, we propose a discontinuity between the sonic point and the critical condition to reach supersonic stellar wind solutions. As a result, supersonic stellar winds can be produced when the initial speed in the coronal base is greater than the eigenspeed. The critical solution or eigen function provided by the conventional stellar wind model describes the condition that separates the supersonic stellar winds from subsonic ones.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first spectroscopic estimates of the chemical abundance of M dwarf stars in a globular cluster (GC), namely 47 Tucanae. By exploiting NIRSpec on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) we gathered low-resolution spectra for 28 stars with masses in the range ~0.4-0.5 solar masses. The spectra are strongly affected by the H2O water vapour bands which can be used as indicators of the oxygen abundance. The spectral analysis reveals that the target stars feature a different O abundance, with a difference of ~0.40 dex between first and the most-polluted second population. The observed range is similar to that observed among red giant stars. This result reinforces previous findings based on the analysis of photometric diagrams, including the ``chromosome maps'', providing a first, and more direct, evidence of light element variations in the M dwarfs' mass regime. The observation that the multiple populations, with their variations in light elements, exhibit the same patterns from the lower main sequence all the way to the red giant branch further strengthens the notion that multiple stellar populations in globular clusters formed in a series of bursts of star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Octans is one of the most distant ($d\sim150$pc) young stellar associations of the solar neighbourhood. Its age is still poorly constrained in the literature and requires further investigation. We take advantage of the state-of-the-art astrometry delivered by the third data release of the Gaia space mission combined with radial velocity measurements obtained from high-resolution spectroscopy to compute the 3D positions and 3D spatial velocities of the stars and derive the dynamical traceback age of the association. We performed an extensive traceback analysis using different subsamples of stars, different metrics to define the size of the association, and different models for the Galactic potential to integrate the stellar orbits in the past. We derive a dynamical age of $34^{+2}_{-2}$Myr that is independent from stellar models and represents the most precise age estimate currently available for the Octans association. After correcting the radial velocity of the stars for the effect of gravitational redshift, we obtain a dynamical age of $33^{+3}_{-1}$Myr, which is in very good agreement with our first solution. This shows that the effect of gravitational redshift is small for such a distant young stellar association. Our result is also consistent with the less accurate age estimates obtained in previous studies from lithium depletion (30-40Myr) and isochrones (20-30Myr). By integrating the stellar orbits in time, we show that the members of Octans and Octans-Near had different locations in the past, which indicates that the two associations are unrelated despite the close proximity in the sky. Our results confirm that it is possible to derive precise dynamical ages via the traceback method for $\sim30$Myr old stellar clusters at about $\sim150$pc with the same precision level that has been achieved in other studies for young stellar groups within 50pc of the Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 Migration commonly occurs during the epoch of planet formation. For emerging gas giant planets, it proceeds concurrently with their growth through the accretion of gas from their natal protoplanetary disks. Similar migration process should also be applied to the stellar-mass black holes embedded in active galactic nucleus disks. In this work, we perform high resolution 3D and 2D numerical hydrodynamical simulations to study the migration dynamics for accreting embedded objects over the disk viscous timescales in a self-consistent manner. We find that an accreting planet embedded in a predominantly viscous disk has a tendency to migrate outward, in contrast to the inward orbital decay of non-accreting planets. 3D and 2D simulations find the consistent outward migration results for the accreting planets. Under this circumstance, the accreting planet's outward migration is mainly due to the asymmetric spiral arms feeding from the global disk into the Hill radius. This is analogous to the unsaturated corotation torque although the imbalance is due to material accretion within the libration timescale rather than diffusion onto the inner disk. In a disk with a relatively small viscosity, the accreting planets clear deep gaps near their orbits. The tendency of inward migration is recovered, albeit with suppressed rates. By performing a parameter survey with a range of disks' viscosity, we find that the transition from outward to inward migration occurs with the effective viscous efficiency factor $\alpha\sim 0.003$ for Jupiter-mass planets.

 - **Abstract**
 The need of real-time of monitoring and alerting systems for Space Weather hazards has grown significantly in the last two decades. One of the most important challenge for space mission operations and planning is the prediction of solar proton events (SPEs). In this context, artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have opened a new frontier, providing a new paradigm for statistical forecasting algorithms. The great majority of these models aim to predict the occurrence of a SPE, i.e., they are based on the classification approach. In this work we present a simple and efficient machine learning regression algorithm which is able to forecast the energetic proton flux up to 1 hour ahead by exploiting features derived from the electron flux only. This approach could be helpful to improve monitoring systems of the radiation risk in both deep space and near-Earth environments. The model is very relevant for mission operations and planning, especially when flare characteristics and source location are not available in real time, as at Mars distance.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric spectroscopy provides a window into the properties of exoplanets. However, the physical interpretation of retrieved data and its implications for the internal properties of exoplanets remains nebulous. This letter addresses three misconceptions held by some atmospheric spectroscopists regarding the connection between observed chemical abundances and theory: (1) Whether atmospheric spectroscopy can provide the bulk atmospheric chemistry, (2) whether it can identify if a planet is cloudless, and (3) whether atmospheric evaporation arguments can be used to dismiss certain compositions inferred through spectroscopy. This letter concludes by exploring applications of remote sensing in the quest for the search for life outside of our solar system.

 - **Abstract**
 The nearby oxygen-rich AGB star L2 Pup hosts a well-studied nearly edge-on disk. To date, disks around AGB stars have not been chemically studied in detail. By combining a parameterisation commonly used for protoplanetary disks and archival ALMA observations, we retrieved an updated density and temperature structure of this disk. This physical model was then used as input to the first chemical model of an AGB disk. The model shows that the physical structure of the disk has a large impact on its chemistry, with certain species showing large changes in column density relative to a radial outflow, indicating that chemistry could be used as a tracer of disks that cannot be directly imaged. Despite its oxygen-rich nature, the daughter species formed within the disk are surprisingly carbon-rich. Two chemical regimes can be distinguished: cosmic-ray induced chemistry in the midplane and photochemistry induced by the interstellar radiation field in the outer regions. Certain complex organic molecules are formed in the midplane. This occurs via gas-phase chemistry only, as the disk is too warm for dust-gas chemistry. The photochemistry in the outer regions leads to the efficient formation of (long) carbon-chains. The predictions of the model allow us to tentatively put the disk's age $\lesssim 10^5$ yr. Additional observations are necessary to better constrain the physical structure of L2 Pup's disk and are essential to test the predictions made by the chemical model. Our exploratory work paves the way for a more general study of the chemistry of AGB disks.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for habitable conditions and signs of life on exoplanets is a major frontier in modern astronomy. Detecting atmospheric signatures of Earth-like exoplanets is challenging due to their small sizes and relatively thin atmospheres. Recently, a new class of habitable sub-Neptune exoplanets, called Hycean worlds, has been theorized. Hycean worlds are planets with H2-rich atmospheres and planet-wide oceans with thermodynamic conditions similar to those in the Earth's oceans. Their large sizes and extended atmospheres, compared to rocky planets of similar mass, make Hycean worlds significantly more accessible to atmospheric observations. These planets open a new avenue in the search for planetary habitability and life elsewhere using spectroscopic observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We observed the transmission spectrum of a candidate Hycean world, K2-18 b, recently with JWST in its first year of operations. The spectrum reveals multiple spectral features of carbon bearing molecules in the planetary atmosphere, leading to the first detections of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in a habitable-zone exoplanet. We discuss inferences of the atmospheric chemical composition and its implications for the atmospheric, interior and surface conditions on the planet, along with the possibility of a habitable ocean underneath the atmosphere. We discuss new observational and theoretical developments in this emerging frontier and their implications for exoplanetary habitability and search for life elsewhere.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring the obliquities of stars hosting giant planets may shed light on the dynamical history of planetary systems. Significant efforts have been made to measure the obliquities of FGK stars with hot Jupiters, mainly based on observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. In contrast, M dwarfs with hot Jupiters have hardly been explored, because such systems are rare and often not favorable for such precise observations. Here, we report the first detection of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for an M dwarf with a hot Jupiter, TOI-4201, using the Gemini-North/MAROON-X spectrograph. We find TOI-4201 to be well-aligned with its giant planet, with a sky-projected obliquity of $\lambda=-3.0_{-3.2}^{+3.7}\ ^{\circ}$ and a true obliquity of $\psi=21.3_{-12.8}^{+12.5}\ ^{\circ}$ with an upper limit of $40^{\circ}$ at a 95% confidence level. The result agrees with dynamically quiet formation or tidal obliquity damping that realigned the system. As the first hot Jupiter around an M dwarf with its obliquity measured, TOI-4201b joins the group of aligned giant planets around cool stars ($T_{\rm eff}<6250\ K$), as well as the small but growing sample of planets with relatively high planet-to-star mass ratio ($M_p/M_\ast\gtrsim 3\times 10^{-3}$) that also appear to be mostly aligned.

 - **Abstract**
 Repeating fast radio bursts can exhibit a wide range of burst repetition rates, from none to hundreds of bursts per hour. Here, we report the detection and characteristics of 57 bursts from the recently discovered FRB 20240114A, observed with GMRT in the frequency ranges 300-500 MHz and 550-750 MHz. Majority of the bursts show narrow emission-bandwidth with $\Delta\nu/\nu \sim$ around 10 %. All of the bursts we detect are faint ($<$10 Jy ms), and thus probe the lower end of the energy distribution. We determine the rate function for FRB 20240114A at 400 MHz, and downward drift rates at 400 and 650 MHz, and discuss our measurements in the context of the repeating FRB population. We observe sudden variations in the burst activity of FRB 20240114A over time. Our data as well as the other publicly available information on other observations of FRB 20240114A so far, there is an indication that FRB 20240114A potentially exhibit a chromaticity in its burst activity. While the burst properties of FRB 20240114A are similar to ther repeating FRBs, the frequency-dependent activity, if established, could provide crucial clues to the origin of repeating FRBs. We also place the most stringent 5$\sigma$ upper limits of 600 $\mu$Jy and 89 $\mu$Jy on any persistent radio source (PRS) associated with FRB 20240114A at 400 MHz and 650 MHz, respectively, and compare these with the luminosity of the known PRSs associated with FRB121102A and FRB190520B.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the planetary migration of low-mass planets ($M_p\in[1,15]M_\oplus$, here $M_\oplus$ is the Earth mass) in a gaseous disc containing a previously formed gap. We perform high-resolution 3D simulations with the FARGO3D code. To create the gap in the surface density of the disc, we use a radial viscosity profile with a bump, which is maintained during the entire simulation time. We find that when the gap is sufficiently deep, the spiral waves excited by the planet trigger the Rossby wave instability, forming cyclonic (underdense) vortices at the edges of the gap. When the planet approaches the gap, it interacts with the vortices, which produce a complex flow structure around the planet. Remarkably, we find a widening of the horseshoe region of the planet produced by the vortex at the outer edge of the gap, which depending on the mass of the planet differs by at least a factor of two with respect to the standard horseshoe width. This inevitably leads to an increase in the corotation torque on the planet and produces an efficient trap to halt its inward migration. In some cases, the planet becomes locked in corotation with the outer vortex. Under this scenario, our results could explain why low-mass planets do not fall towards the central star within the lifetime of the protoplanetary disc. Lastly, the development of these vortices produces an asymmetric temporal evolution of the gap, which could explain the structures observed in some protoplanetary discs.

 - **Abstract**
 Rings and gaps are among the most widely observed forms of substructure in protoplanetary disks. A gap-ring pair may be formed when a planet carves a gap in the disk, which produces a local pressure maximum following the gap that traps inwardly drifting dust grains and appears as a bright ring due to the enhanced dust density. A dust-trapping ring would provide a promising environment for solid growth and possibly planetesimal production via the streaming instability. We present evidence of dust trapping in the bright ring of the planet-hosting disk Elias 2-24, from the analysis of 1.3 mm and 3 mm ALMA observations at high spatial resolution (0.029 arcsec, 4.0 au). We leverage the high spatial resolution to demonstrate that larger grains are more efficiently trapped and place constraints on the local turbulence ($8 \times 10^{-4} < \alpha_\mathrm{turb} < 0.03$) and the gas-to-dust ratio ($\Sigma_g / \Sigma_d < 30$) in the ring. Using a scattering-included marginal probability analysis we measure a total dust disk mass of $M_\mathrm{dust} = 13.8^{+0.7}_{-0.5} \times 10^{-4} \ M_\odot$. We also show that at the orbital radius of the proposed perturber, the gap is cleared of material down to a flux contrast of 10$^{-3}$ of the peak flux in the disk.
