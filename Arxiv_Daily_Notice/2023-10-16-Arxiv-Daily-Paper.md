 - **Abstract**
 The second generation of the Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon (EUSO-SPB2) is a balloon instrument that searched for ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with energies above 1 EeV and very high energy neutrinos with energies above 1 PeV. EUSO-SPB2 consists of two telescopes: a fluorescence telescope pointed downward for the detection of UHECRs and a Cherenkov telescope toward the limb for the detection of PeV-scale showers produced by neutrino-sourced tau decay (just below the limb) and by cosmic rays (just above the limb). Clouds inside the fields of view of these telescopes--particularly that of the fluorescence telescope--reduce EUSO-SPB2's geometric aperture. As such, cloud coverage and cloud-top altitude within the field of view of the fluorescence telescope must be monitored throughout data-taking. The University of Chicago Infrared Camera (UCIRC2) monitored these clouds using two infrared cameras centered at 10 and 12 $\mu$m. By capturing images at wavelengths spanning the cloud thermal emission peak, UCIRC2 measured cloud color-temperatures and thus cloud-top altitudes. In this contribution, we provide an overview of UCIRC2, including an update on its construction and performance. We also show first results from the flight.

 - **Abstract**
 The wind mission Aeolus of the European Space Agency was a groundbreaking achievement for Earth observation. Between 2018 and 2023, the space-borne lidar instrument ALADIN onboard the Aeolus satellite measured atmospheric wind profiles with global coverage which contributed to improving the accuracy of numerical weather prediction. The precision of the wind observations, however, declined over the course of the mission due to a progressive loss of the atmospheric backscatter signal. The analysis of the root cause was supported by the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina whose fluorescence detector registered the ultraviolet laser pulses emitted from the instrument in space, thereby offering an estimation of the laser energy at the exit of the instrument for several days in 2019, 2020 and 2021. The reconstruction of the laser beam not only allowed for an independent assessment of the Aeolus performance, but also helped to improve the accuracy in the determination of the laser beam's ground track on single pulse level. The results presented in this paper set a precedent for the monitoring of space lasers by ground-based telescopes and open new possibilities for the calibration of cosmic-ray observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 Clouds are prevalent in many of the exoplanet atmospheres that have been observed to date. For transiting exoplanets, we know if clouds are present because they mute spectral features and cause wavelength-dependent scattering. While the exact composition of these clouds is largely unknown, this information is vital to understanding the chemistry and energy budget of planetary atmospheres. In this work, we observe one transit of the hot Jupiter WASP-17b with JWST's MIRI LRS and generate a transmission spectrum from 5-12 $\rm{\mu}$m. These wavelengths allow us to probe absorption due to the vibrational modes of various predicted cloud species. Our transmission spectrum shows additional opacity centered at 8.6 $\rm{\mu}$m, and detailed atmospheric modeling and retrievals identify this feature as SiO$_2$(s) (quartz) clouds. The SiO$_2$(s) clouds model is preferred at 3.5-4.2$\sigma$ versus a cloud-free model and at 2.6$\sigma$ versus a generic aerosol prescription. We find the SiO$_2$(s) clouds are comprised of small ${\sim}0.01$ $\rm{\mu}$m particles, which extend to high altitudes in the atmosphere. The atmosphere also shows a depletion of H$_2$O, a finding consistent with the formation of high-temperature aerosols from oxygen-rich species. This work is part of a series of studies by our JWST Telescope Scientist Team (JWST-TST), in which we will use Guaranteed Time Observations to perform Deep Reconnaissance of Exoplanet Atmospheres through Multi-instrument Spectroscopy (DREAMS).

 - **Abstract**
 Thorne-\.{Z}ytkow objects (T\.{Z}Os), hypothetical merger products in which a central neutron star powers a stellar envelope, are traditionally considered steady-state configurations, though their assembly, especially through dynamical channels, is not well-understood. The predominant focus in the literature has been the observational signatures related to the long-term fate and evolution of T\.{Z}Os, with their initial formation often treated as a given. However, the foundational calculations supporting the existence of T\.{Z}Os assumed non-rotating, spherically symmetric initial conditions that are inconsistent with a merger scenario. In this work, we explore the implications of post-merger dynamics in T\.{Z}O formation scenarios with field binary progenitors, specifically the role that angular momentum transport during the common envelope phase plays in constraining possible merger products, using the tools of stellar evolution and three-dimensional hydrodynamics. We also propose an alternative steady-state outcome for these mergers: the thin-envelope T\.{Z}O. These potential X-ray sources would follow a series of bright transient events and may be of interest to upcoming time-domain surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The Standards of Fundamental Astronomy (SOFA) is a service provided by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) that offers algorithms and software for astronomical calculations, which was released in two versions by FORTRAN 77 and ANSI C, respectively. In this work, we implement the python package PyMsOfa for SOFA service by three ways: (1) a python wrapper package based on a foreign function library for Python (ctypes), (2) a python wrapper package with the foreign function interface for Python calling C code (cffi), and (3) a python package directly written in pure python codes from SOFA subroutines. The package PyMsOfa has fully implemented 247 functions of the original SOFA routines. In addition, PyMsOfa is also extensively examined, which is exactly consistent with those test examples given by the original SOFA. This python package can be suitable to not only the astrometric detection of habitable planets of the Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) mission (Ji et al. 2022), but also for the frontiers themes of black holes and dark matter related to astrometric calculations and other fields. The source codes are available via https://github.com/CHES2023/PyMsOfa.

 - **Abstract**
 We compare systems with single giant planets to systems with multiple giant planets using a catalog of planets from a high-precision radial velocity survey of FGKM stars. Our comparison focuses on orbital properties, planet masses, and host star properties. We use hierarchical methods to model the orbital eccentricity distributions of giant singles and giant multis, and find that the distributions are distinct. The multiple giant planets typically have moderate eccentricities and their eccentricity distribution extends to $e=0.47$ (90th percentile), while the single giant planets have a pile-up of nearly circular orbits and a long tail that extends to $e=0.77$. We determine that stellar hosts of multiple giants are distinctly more metal-rich than hosts of solitary giants, with respective mean metallicities $0.228\pm0.027$ vs. $0.129\pm0.019$ dex. We measure the distinct occurrence distributions of single and multiple giants with respect to orbital separation, and find that single gas giants have a $\sim$2.3$\sigma$ significant hot ($a<0.06$) Jupiter pile-up not seen among multi giant systems. We find that the median mass ($\msini$ ) of giants in multiples is nearly double that of single giants (1.71 $\mjup$ vs. 0.92 $\mjup$ ). We find that giant planets in the same system have correlated masses, analogous to the `peas in a pod' effect seen among less massive planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Optimal atmospheric conditions are beneficial for detecting exoplanets via high contrast imaging (HCI), as speckles from adaptive optics' (AO's) residuals can make it difficult to identify exoplanets. While AO systems greatly improve our image quality, having access to real-time estimates of atmospheric conditions could also help astronomers use their telescope time more efficiently in the search for exoplanets as well as aid in the data reduction process. The Shack-Hartmann Imaging Motion Monitor (SHIMM) is an atmospheric profiler that utilizes a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor to create spot images of a single star in order to reconstruct important atmospheric parameters such as the Fried parameter ($r_0$), $C_n^2$ profile and coherence time. Due to its simplicity, the SHIMM can be directly used on a telescope to get in situ measurements while observing. We present our implementation of the Nickel-SHIMM design for the one meter Nickel Telescope at Lick Observatory. We utilize an HCIPy simulation of turbulence propagating across a telescope aperture to verify the SHIMM data reduction pipeline as we begin on-sky testing. We also used on-sky data from the AO system on the Shane Telescope to further validate our analysis, finding that both our simulation and data reduction pipeline are consistent with previously determined results for the Fried parameter at the Lick Observatory. Finally, we present first light results from commissioning of the Nickel-SHIMM.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) We investigate the impact of radiative feedback from massive stars on their natal cloud and focus on the transition from the HII region to the atomic PDR (crossing the ionisation front (IF)), and the subsequent transition to the molecular PDR (crossing the dissociation front (DF)). We use high-resolution near-IR integral field spectroscopic data from NIRSpec on JWST to observe the Orion Bar PDR as part of the PDRs4All JWST Early Release Science Program. The NIRSpec data reveal a forest of lines including, but not limited to, HeI, HI, and CI recombination lines, ionic lines, OI and NI fluorescence lines, Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs including aromatic CH, aliphatic CH, and their CD counterparts), CO2 ice, pure rotational and ro-vibrational lines from H2, and ro-vibrational lines HD, CO, and CH+, most of them detected for the first time towards a PDR. Their spatial distribution resolves the H and He ionisation structure in the Huygens region, gives insight into the geometry of the Bar, and confirms the large-scale stratification of PDRs. We observe numerous smaller scale structures whose typical size decreases with distance from Ori C and IR lines from CI, if solely arising from radiative recombination and cascade, reveal very high gas temperatures consistent with the hot irradiated surface of small-scale dense clumps deep inside the PDR. The H2 lines reveal multiple, prominent filaments which exhibit different characteristics. This leaves the impression of a "terraced" transition from the predominantly atomic surface region to the CO-rich molecular zone deeper in. This study showcases the discovery space created by JWST to further our understanding of the impact radiation from young stars has on their natal molecular cloud and proto-planetary disk, which touches on star- and planet formation as well as galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The Arjuna asteroid belt is loosely defined as a diverse group of small asteroids that follow dynamically cold, Earth-like orbits. Most of them are not actively engaged in resonant, co-orbital behavior with Earth. Some of them experience temporary but recurrent horseshoe episodes. Objects in horseshoe paths tend to approach Earth at low velocity leading to captures as Earth's temporary satellites or mini-moons. Four such objects have already been identified: 1991 VG, 2006 RH120, 2020 CD3, and 2022 NX1. Here, we focus on 2023 FY3, a recent finding whose trajectory might have co-orbital status and perhaps lead to temporary captures. Aims. We want to determine the physical properties of 2023 FY3 and explore its dynamical evolution. Methods. We carried out an observational study of 2023 FY3 using the OSIRIS camera spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias, to derive its spectral class, and time-series photometry obtained with QHY411M cameras and two units of the Two-meter Twin Telescope to investigate its rotational state. N-body simulations were also performed to examine its possible resonant behavior. Results. The visible reflectance spectrum of 2023 FY3 is consistent with that of an S-type asteroid; its light curve gives a rotation period of 9.3$\pm$0.6 min with an amplitude of 0.48$\pm$0.13 mag. We confirm that 2023 FY3 roams the edge of Earth's co-orbital space. Conclusions. Arjuna 2023 FY3, an S-type asteroid and fast rotator, currently exhibits horseshoe-like resonant behavior and experienced mini-moon engagements of the temporarily captured flyby type in the past that may repeat in the future. The spectral type result further confirms that mini-moons are a diverse population in terms of surface composition.

 - **Abstract**
 SNe II show growing evidence of interaction with CSM surrounding their progenitor stars as a consequence of enhanced mass loss during the last years of the progenitor's life. We present an analysis of the progenitor mass-loss history of SN2023ixf, a nearby SN II showing signs of interaction. We calculate the early-time bolometric light curve (LC) for SN2023ixf based on the integration of the observed flux covering UV, optical and NIR bands, and black-body extrapolations for the unobserved flux. Our calculations spot the sudden increase to maximum luminosity and temperature, in addition to the subsequent fall, displaying an evident peak. This is the first time that this phase can be precisely estimated for a SN II showing interesting characteristics as: 1) slope changes during the rise to maximum luminosity; and 2) a very sharp peak with a maximum luminosity of $\sim$3$\times$10$^{45}$erg s$^{-1}$. We use the bolometric LC of SN2023ixf to test the calibrations of bolometric corrections against colours from the literature. In addition, we include SN2023ixf into some of the available calibrations to extend their use to earlier epochs. Comparison of the observed bolometric LC to SN II explosion models with CSM interaction suggests a progenitor mass-loss rate of 3$\times$10$^{-3}M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ confined to 12000$R_{\odot}$ and a wind acceleration parameter of $\beta$=5. This model reproduces the early bolometric LC, expansion velocities, and the epoch of disappearance of interacting lines in the spectra. This model indicates that the wind was launched $\sim$80yr before the explosion. If the effect of the wind acceleration is not taken into account, the enhanced wind must have developed over the final months to years prior to the SN, which may not be consistent with the lack of outburst detection in pre-explosion images over the last $\sim$20yr before explosion.
#### Very high energy gamma-ray emission beyond 10 TeV from GRB 221009A

 - **Abstract**
 The highest energy photons from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have important implications for the physics of particle acceleration and constraints on the extragalactic background light (EBL). Here we report for the first time the detection of photons beyond 10 TeV from the unprecedentedly brightest GRB 221009A by the Large High Altitude Air-shower Observatory (LHAASO). The LHAASO-KM2A detector registered more than 140 photons with energies above 3 TeV from GRB 221009A during 230$-$900s after the trigger. The intrinsic energy spectrum of gamma-rays can be described by a power-law after correcting for EBL absorption, with the highest energy photon of 13 TeV. Such a hard spectrum challenges the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) scenario of relativistic electrons for the afterglow emission above several TeV, because the Klein-Nishina effect and the internal $\gamma\gamma$ absorption within the GRB generally lead to a spectral softening towards high energies. Observations of photons up to 13 TeV from a source with a measured redshift of z=0.151 requires more transparency in intergalactic space than previously expected, in order to avoid an unusual pile-up at the end of the spectrum. Alternatively, one may invoke new physics such as Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) or assume an axion origin of very high energy (VHE) signals.
#### TOI-5126: A hot super-Neptune and warm Neptune pair discovered by  $\textit{TESS}$ and $\textit{CHEOPS}$

 - **Abstract**
 We present the confirmation of a hot super-Neptune with an exterior Neptune companion orbiting a bright (V = 10.1 mag) F-dwarf identified by the $\textit{Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite}$ ($\textit{TESS}$). The two planets, observed in sectors 45, 46 and 48 of the $\textit{TESS}$ extended mission, are $4.74^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ $R_{\oplus}$ and $3.86^{+0.17}_{-0.16}$ $R_{\oplus}$ with $5.4588385^{+0.0000070}_{-0.0000072}$ d and $17.8999^{+0.0018}_{-0.0013}$ d orbital periods, respectively. We also obtained precise space based photometric follow-up of the system with ESAs $\textit{CHaracterising ExOplanets Satellite}$ ($\textit{CHEOPS}$) to constrain the radius and ephemeris of TOI-5126 b. TOI 5126 b is located in the "hot Neptune Desert" and is an ideal candidate for follow-up transmission spectroscopy due to its high predicted equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq} = 1442^{+46}_{-40}$ K) implying a cloud-free atmosphere. TOI-5126 c is a warm Neptune ($T_{eq}= 971^{+31}_{-27}$ K) also suitable for follow-up. Tentative transit timing variations (TTVs) have also been identified in analysis, suggesting the presence of at least one additional planet, however this signal may be caused by spot-crossing events, necessitating further precise photometric follow-up to confirm these signals.
#### Detection of a ~ 0.1c radio knot in M81* associated with a moderate  X-ray flare

 - **Abstract**
 Through very long baseline interferometry observations of one of the closest low-luminosity active galactic nuclei M81* at multifrequencies of 8.8, 22 and 44GHz, a bright discrete knot with an unusual low apparent speed $\sim$0.1c was detected. Combining with the contemporary monitoring of X-rays data at 2-10keV, it indicates that a moderate X-ray flare happened when the knot launched from the core region. Three possible origins of the knot are proposed to explain our observational results. They are an episodic jet ejection, a low-speed shock wave, and a possible secondary black hole in a binary system, respectively. Future intensive multiwavelength monitoring can help to understand the discrete knot as well as the central black hole better.
#### Robust r-process Nucleosynthesis Beyond Lanthanides in the Common  Envelop Jet Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 The common envelop jet supernovae (CEJSN) r-process scenario has been proposed as an r-process nucleosynthesis site in the past decade. Jets launched by a neutron star that spirals-in inside the core of a red supergiant star in a common envelope evolution supply the proper conditions for the formation of elements heavier than iron through the rapid neutron capture process. The present work initially unveils the r-process abundance patterns that result from the density profile in the relatively long-lived jets. The results indicate that the CEJSN r-process scenario can produce the largest ratio of the third r-process peak elements to Lanthanides among current r-process scenarios, and in addition can form quite an amount of Lanthanides in a single event. The comparison of the ratio of the third peak elements to the Lanthanides with a number of observed r-enhanced metal-poor stars and with other r-process scenarios suggests that a high mass of third peak elements is anti-correlated with high fraction of Lanthanides, both in observations and theory. The CEJSN r-process scenario plays a significant role in this conclusion, since it reproduces the observational features of some particular r-enhanced metal-poor stars where other r-process scenarios encounter problems. Due to the formation of extremely heavy elements, the CEJSN also offers a credible estimation on the age of the most Actinide boosted star by cosmochronometry.

 - **Abstract**
 During the long term evolution of globular clusters (GCs), a part of member stars are lost to the field. The recently found nitrogen-rich (N-rich) metal-poor field stars are promising candidates of these GC escapees, since N enhancement is the fingerprint of chemically enhanced populations in GCs. In this work, we discuss the possibility of identifying N-rich metal-poor field stars with the upcoming China space station telescope (CSST). We focus on the main survey camera with NUV, u, g, r, i, z, y filters and slitless spectrograph with a resolution about 200. The combination of UV sensitive equipment and prominent N-related molecular lines in the UV band bodes well for the identification: the color-color diagram of (u-g) versus (g-r) is capable of separating N-rich field stars and normal halo stars, if metallicity can be estimated without using the information of u-band photometry. Besides, the synthetic spectra show that a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 is sufficient to identify N-rich field stars. In the near future, a large sample of N-rich field stars found by CSST, combined with state-of-the-art N-body simulations will be crucial to decipher the GC-Galaxy co-evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Models for gamma-ray burst afterglow dynamics and synchrotron spectra are known to exhibit various scale invariances, owing to the scale-free nature of fluid dynamics and the power-law shape of synchrotron spectra. Since the observations of a gamma-ray burst and afterglow directly associated with the detection of gravitational waves from a neutron star merger (GW170817), off-axis jet models including a lateral energy structure in the initial outflow geometry have gained in prominence. Here we demonstrate how scale-invariance carries over to arbitrary jet structure and dynamical stages. We provide afterglow flux expressions for arbitrary light curve slope and jet structure and demonstrate how these can be used to quickly assess the physical implications of afterglow observations. We show how the late Deep Newtonian afterglow stage remains scale-invariant but adds distinct spectral scaling regimes. Finally, we show that for given jet structure a universal curve can be constructed of the centroid offset (that can be measured using very-large baseline interferometry) versus observer angle, in a manner independent of explosion energy and circumburst density. Our results apply to any synchrotron transient characterized by a release of energy in an external medium, including supernova remnants, kilonova afterglows and soft gamma-repeater flares.

 - **Abstract**
 Transit observations have become an important technique to probe exoplanets. Therefore, there are many projects carrying on organized observations of transit events, which make a huge amount of light-curve and transit timing data available. We consider this as an excellent opportunity to search for possible orbital decays of exoplanets from this big number of mid-transit times through data-model fitting with both fixed-orbit and orbit-decay models. In order to perform this task, we collect mid-transit-time data from several sources and construct the most complete database up to date. Among 144 hot Jupiters in our study, HAT-P-51b, HAT-P-53b, TrES-5b, WASP-12b are classified as the orbit-decay cases. Thus, in addition to reconfirming WASP-12b as an orbit-decay planet, our results indicate that HAT-P-51b, HAT-P-53b, TrES-5b are potential orbit-decay candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 As evidenced by recent survey results, majority of asteroids are slow rotators (P>12 h), but lack spin and shape models due to selection bias. This bias is skewing our overall understanding of the spins, shapes, and sizes of asteroids, as well as of their other properties. Also, diameter determinations for large (>60km) and medium-sized asteroids (between 30 and 60 km) often vary by over 30% for multiple reasons. Our long-term project is focused on a few tens of slow rotators with periods of up to 60 hours. We aim to obtain their full light curves and reconstruct their spins and shapes. We also precisely scale the models, typically with an accuracy of a few percent. We used wide sets of dense light curves for spin and shape reconstructions via light-curve inversion. Precisely scaling them with thermal data was not possible here because of poor infrared data: large bodies are too bright for WISE mission. Therefore, we recently launched a campaign among stellar occultation observers, to scale these models and to verify the shape solutions, often allowing us to break the mirror pole ambiguity. The presented scheme resulted in shape models for 16 slow rotators, most of them for the first time. Fitting them to stellar occultations resolved previous inconsistencies in size determinations. For around half of the targets, this fitting also allowed us to identify a clearly preferred pole solution, thus removing the ambiguity inherent to light-curve inversion. We also address the influence of the uncertainty of the shape models on the derived diameters. Overall, our project has already provided reliable models for around 50 slow rotators. Such well-determined and scaled asteroid shapes will, e.g. constitute a solid basis for density determinations when coupled with mass information. Spin and shape models continue to fill the gaps caused by various biases.
#### Spectroscopic triples and a chance alignment. A solution for a problem  of suspicious mass ratios for SB2s from Wilson method

 - **Abstract**
 We selected three double-lined spectroscopic binary systems which have extreme mass ratios, if measured using the Wilson method. We analysed medium resolution spectroscopic observations and space-based photometry and find that all these systems are not SB2, but rather triple systems and a chance alignment of another star with SB1 that have an unseen component. Therefore suspicious mass ratios determined by the Wilson method for some double-lined spectroscopic binary systems aren't correct as these systems are more complex.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. Our goal is to study the long-term mass-loss rate characteristics of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars through wind-wind and wind-interstellar medium interaction. Methods. Far-ultraviolet (FUV) images from the Galex survey are used to investigate extended UV emission associated with AGB stars. Results. FUV emission was found towards eight objects. The emission displays different shapes and sizes; interaction regions were identified, often with infrared counterparts, but no equivalent near-ultraviolet (NUV) emission was found in most cases. Conclusions. The FUV emission is likely attributed to shock-excited molecular hydrogen, considering the lack of NUV emission and the large space velocities of the objects, and makes it possible to trace old structures that are too faint to be observed, for instance, in the infrared.

 - **Abstract**
 Aluminium-26 is a radioactive isotope which can be synthesized within asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, primarily through hot bottom burning. Studies exploring $^{26}$Al production within AGB stars typically focus on single-stars; however, observations show that low- and intermediate-mass stars commonly exist in binaries. We use the binary population synthesis code binary_c to explore the impact of binary evolution on $^{26}$Al yields at solar metallicity both within individual AGB stars and a low/intermediate-mass stellar population. We find the key stellar structural condition achieving most $^{26}$Al overproduction is for stars to enter the thermally-pulsing AGB (TP-AGB) phase with small cores relative to their total masses, allowing those stars to spend abnormally long times on the TP-AGB compared to single-stars of identical mass. Our population with a binary fraction of 0.75 has an $^{26}$Al weighted population yield increase of $25\%$ compared to our population of only single-stars. Stellar-models calculated from the Mt Stromlo/Monash Stellar Structure Program, which we use to test our results from binary_c and closely examine the interior structure of the overproducing stars, support our binary_c results only when the stellar envelope gains mass after core-He depletion. Stars which gain mass before core-He depletion still overproduce $^{26}$Al, but to a lesser extent. This introduces some physical uncertainty into our conclusions as $55\%$ of our $^{26}$Al overproducing stars gain envelope mass through stellar wind accretion onto pre-AGB objects. Our work highlights the need to consider binary influence on the production of $^{26}$Al.

 - **Abstract**
 The ideal spectral averaging method depends on one's science goals and the available information about one's data. Including low-quality data in the average can decrease the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which may necessitate an optimization method or a consideration of different weighting schemes. Here, we explore a variety of spectral averaging methods. We investigate the use of three weighting schemes during averaging: weighting by the signal divided by the variance ("intensity-noise weighting"), weighting by the inverse of the variance ("noise weighting"), and uniform weighting. Whereas for intensity-noise weighting the SNR is maximized when all spectra are averaged, for noise and uniform weighting we find that averaging the 35-45% of spectra with the highest SNR results in the highest SNR average spectrum. With this intensity cutoff, the average spectrum with noise or uniform weighting has ~95% of the intensity of the spectrum created from intensity-noise weighting. We apply our spectral averaging methods to GBT Diffuse Ionized Gas (GDIGS) hydrogen radio recombination line (RRL) data to determine the ionic abundance ratio, y+, and discuss future applications of the methodology.

 - **Abstract**
 Planet formation models rely on knowledge of the physical conditions and evolutionary processes in protoplanetary disks, in particular the grain size distribution and dust growth timescales. In theoretical models, several barriers exist that prevent grain growth to pebble sizes and beyond, such as the radial drift and fragmentation. Pressure bumps have been proposed to overcome such barriers. In the past decade ALMA has revealed observational evidence for the existence of such pressure bumps in the form of dust traps, such as dust rings, gaps, cavities and crescents through high-resolution millimeter continuum data originating from thermal dust emission of pebble-sized dust grains. These substructures may be related to young protoplanets, either as the starting point or the consequence of early planet formation. Furthermore, disk dust masses have been measured for complete samples of young stars in clusters, which provide initial conditions for the solid mass budget available for planet formation. However, observational biases exist in the selection of high-resolution ALMA observations and uncertainties exist in the derivation of the disk dust mass, which both may affect the observed trends. This chapter describes the latest insights in dust evolution and disk continuum observations. Specifically, disk populations and evolutionary trends are described, as well as the uncertainties therein, and compared with exoplanet demographics.

 - **Abstract**
 A new instrument was designed to take visible-light (VL) polarized brightness ($pB$) observations of the solar corona during the 14 December 2020 total solar eclipse. The instrument, called the Coronal Imaging Polarizer (CIP), consisted of a 16 MP CMOS detector, a linear polarizer housed within a piezoelectric rotation mount, and an f-5.6, 200 mm DSLR lens. Observations were successfully obtained, despite poor weather conditions, for five different exposure times (0.001 s, 0.01 s, 0.1 s, 1 s, and 3 s) at six different orientation angles of the linear polarizer (0\de, 30\de, 60\de, 90\de, 120\de, and 150\de). The images were manually aligned using the drift of background stars in the sky and images of different exposure times were combined using a simple signal-to-noise ratio cut. The polarization and brightness of the local sky is also estimated and the observations were subsequently corrected. The $pB$ of the K-corona was determined using least squares fitting and radiometric calibration was done relative to the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO) K-Cor $pB$ observations from the day of the eclipse. The $pB$ data was then inverted to acquire the coronal electron density, $n_e$, for an equatorial streamer and a polar coronal hole, which agreed very well with previous studies. The effect of changing the number of polarizer angles used to compute the $pB$ is also discussed and it is found that the results vary by up to $\sim$ 13\% when using all six polarizer angles versus only a select three angles.

 - **Abstract**
 Small-scale correlations measured in the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest encode information about the intergalactic medium and the primordial matter power spectrum. In this article, we present and implement a simple method to measure the 3-dimensional power spectrum, $P_{\rm 3D}$, of the Ly$\alpha$ forest at wavenumbers $k$ corresponding to small, $\sim$ Mpc scales. In order to estimate $P_{\rm 3D}$ from sparsely and unevenly distributed data samples, we rely on averaging 1-dimensional Fourier Transforms, as previously carried out to estimate the 1-dimensional power spectrum of the Ly$\alpha$ forest, $P_{\rm 1D}$. This methodology exhibits a very low computational cost. We confirm the validity of this approach through its application to Nyx cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Subsequently, we apply our method to the eBOSS DR16 Ly$\alpha$ forest sample, providing as a proof of principle, a first $P_{\rm 3D}$ measurement averaged over two redshift bins $z=2.2$ and $z=2.4$. This work highlights the potential for forthcoming $P_{\rm 3D}$ measurements, from upcoming large spectroscopic surveys, to untangle degeneracies in the cosmological interpretation of $P_{\rm 1D}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Characterizing the dust thermal structure in protoplanetary disks is a fundamental task as the dust surface temperature can affect both the planetary formation and the chemical evolution. Since the temperature is dependent on many parameters, including the grain size, properly modeling the grain temperature structure can be challenging. Many chemistry disk models usually employ a sophisticated single dust structure designed to reproduce the effect of a realistic population presumably composed of a large diversity of sizes. This generally represents a good approximation in most cases. Nonetheless, this dilutes the effects of the complex radiative interactions between the different grain populations on the resulting dust temperature, and thus the chemistry. We seek to show that the radiative interactions between dust grains of different sizes can induce a non-trivial dust temperature structure that cannot be reproduced by a single dust population and that can significantly affect the chemical outcome. The disk thermal structures are computed using the Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC-3D. The thermal structures are post-processed using the gas-grain code NAUTILUS to calculate the evolution of the chemical abundance. We find that simultaneously using at least two independent dust grain populations in disk models produces a complex temperature structure due to the starlight intercepted by the upper layers of the disk. In particular, we find that micron-sized dust grains are warmer than larger grains and can even show a radial temperature bump in some conditions. This dust temperature spread between the grains populations results in the segregation of the CO snowline and the presence of an unexpected CO gas hole along the midplane. We compare the results with observed close to edge-on class I/II disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Our earlier laboratory measurements showed that low-velocity sand impacts release fine <5 {\mu}m dust from a Martian simulant soil. This dust will become airborne in the Martian atmosphere. Here, we extend this study by measuring aerodynamic properties of ejecta and characterizing deviations from the behavior of spherical, monolithic grains. We observe the settling of particles emitted as part of an impact splash. The sizes (20 to 280 {\mu}m) and sedimentation velocities (0.1 to 0.8 ms^{-1} ) of the particles are deduced from high-speed videos while the particles sediment under low ambient pressure of about 1 mbar. The particles regularly settle slower than expected, down to a factor of about 0.3. Using optical microscopy, the shape of the captured particles is characterized by simple axis ratios (longest/smallest), which show that the vast majority of particles are irregular but typically not too elongated, with axis ratios below 2 on average. Electron microscopy further reveals that the particles are typically porous aggregates, which is the most likely reason for the reduction of the sedimentation velocity. Due to the reduced bulk density, aggregates up to 10 {\mu}m in diameter should regularly be a part of the dust in the Martian atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent analysis of the Planck 2018 polarization data shows a nonzero isotropic cosmic birefringence (ICB) that is not explained within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. We then explore the question of whether the nonzero ICB is interpreted by the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), or at the energy scales of the cosmic microwave background, the low-energy EFT (LEFT) whose dynamical degrees of freedom are five SM quarks and all neutral and charged leptons. Our systematic study reveals that any operator in the EFT on a cosmological background would not give the reported ICB angle, which is observationally consistent with frequency independence. In particular, we estimate the size of the ICB angle generated by the effect that the cosmic microwave background photons travel through the medium of the cosmic neutrino background with parity-violating neutrino-photon interactions and find that it would be too small to explain the data. If the reported ICB angle should be confirmed, then our result would indicate the existence of a new particle that is lighter than the electroweak scale and feebly interacting with the SM particles.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a JWST mid-infrared spectrum of the under-luminous Type Ia Supernova (SN Ia) 2022xkq. The spectrum was obtained with the medium-resolution spectrometer on the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) roughly 130 days after explosion. We identify the first MIR lines beyond 14 $\mu$m in SN Ia observations. We also find distinct features unique to under-luminous SNe Ia, including: isolated emission of stable Ni, strong blends of [Ti II], and large ratios of singly ionized to doubly ionized species in both [Ar] and [Co]. Comparisons to normal-luminosity SNe Ia spectra at similar phases show a tentative trend between the width of the [Co III] 11.888 $\mu$m feature and the SN light curve shape. Using non-LTE-multi-dimensional radiation hydro simulations and the observed electron capture elements we constrain the mass of the exploding white dwarf. The best-fitting model shows that SN 2022xkq is consistent with an off-center delayed-detonation explosion of a near-Chandrasekhar mass WD of high-central density ($\rho_{c} \geq 2.0 \times 10^{9}$ g cm$^{-3}$) seen equator on, and produced M($^{58}$Ni) $\geq 0.06$ M$_{\odot}$. The observed line width of various species are consistent with the overall abundance distribution; and the narrow stable Ni lines indicate little to no mixing in the central regions, favoring central ignition of sub-sonic carbon burning followed by an off-center DDT which begins at a single point. Observations at later epochs may further constrain the physics revealing the presence of additional species including Cr and Mn. Our work demonstrates the power of using the full coverage of MIRI in combination with detailed modeling to elucidate the physics of SNe Ia at a level not previously possible.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmology faces a pressing challenge with the Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension, where the locally measured rate of the Universe's expansion does not align with predictions from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) calibrated with $\Lambda$CDM model. Simultaneously, there is a growing tension involving the weighted amplitude of matter fluctuations, known as $S_{8,0}$ tension. Resolving both tensions within one framework would boost confidence in any one particular model. In this work, we analyse constraints in $f(T)$ gravity, a framework that shows promise in shedding light on cosmic evolution. We thoroughly examine prominent $f(T)$ gravity models using a combination of data sources, including Pantheon+ (SN), cosmic chronometers (CC), baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and redshift space distortion (RSD) data. We use these models to derive a spectrum of $H_0$ and $S_{8,0}$ values, aiming to gauge their ability to provide insights into, and potentially address, the challenges posed by the $H_0$ and $S_{8,0}$ tensions.

 - **Abstract**
 Axion inflation, i.e. an axion-like inflaton coupled to an Abelian gauge field through a Chern-Simons interaction, comes with a rich and testable phenomenology. This is particularly true in the strong backreaction regime, where the gauge field production heavily impacts the axion dynamics. Lattice simulations have recently demonstrated the importance of accounting for inhomogeneities of the axion field in this regime. We propose a perturbative scheme to account for these inhomogeneities while maintaining high computational efficiency. Our goal is to accurately capture deviations from the homogeneous axion field approximation within the perturbative regime as well as self-consistently determine the onset of the non-perturbative regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Most stars are in multiple systems, with the majority of those being binaries. A large number of planets have been confirmed in binary stars and therefore it is important to understand their formation and dynamical evolution. We perform simulations to investigate the migration of wide-orbit giant planets (semi-major axis 100 AU) in massive circumbinary discs (mass 0.1 M$_{\odot}$) that are marginally gravitationally unstable, using the three-dimensional Smooth Particle Hydrodynamic code SEREN. We vary the binary parameters to explore their effect on planet migration. We find that a planet in a massive circumbinary disc initially undergoes a period of rapid inward migration before switching to a slow outward migration, as it does in a circumstellar disc. However, the presence of the binary enhances planet migration and mass growth. We find that a high binary mass ratio (binary with equal mass stars) results in more enhanced outward planet migration. Additionally, larger binary separation and/or higher binary eccentricity results to a faster outward planet migration and stronger planet growth. We conclude that wide-orbit giant planets attain wider final orbits due to migration around binary stars than around single stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The Bluebild algorithm is a new technique for image synthesis in radio astronomy which forms a least-squares estimate of the sky intensity function using the theory of sampling and interpolation operators. We present an HPC implementation of the Bluebild algorithm for radio-interferometric imaging: Bluebild Imaging++ (BIPP). BIPP is a spherical imager that leverages functional PCA to decompose the sky into distinct energy levels. The library features interfaces to C++, C and Python and is designed with seamless GPU acceleration in mind. We evaluate the accuracy and performance of BIPP on simulated observations of the upcoming Square Kilometer Array Observatory and real data from the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) telescope. We find that BIPP offers accurate wide-field imaging with no need for a w-term approximation and has comparable execution time with respect to the interferometric imaging libraries CASA and WSClean. Futhermore, due to the energy level decomposition, images produced with BIPP can reveal information about faint and diffuse structures before any cleaning iterations. The source code of BIPP is publicly released.

 The star forming processes strongly influence the ISM chemistry. Nowadays, there are available many high-quality databases at millimeter wavelengths. Using them, it is possible to carry out studies that review and deepen previous results. If these studies involve large samples of sources, it is preferred to use direct tools to study the molecular gas. With the aim of testing these tools such as the use of the HCN/HNC ratio as a thermometer, and the use of H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$, HC$_{3}$N, N$_{2}$H$^{+}$, and C$_{2}$H as "chemical clocks", we present a molecular line study towards 55 sources representing massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) at different evolutive stages: infrared dark clouds (IRDCs), high-mass protostellar objects (HMPOs), hot molecular cores (HMCs) and ultracompact HII regions (UCHII). We found that the use of HCN/HNC ratio as an universal thermometer in the ISM should be taken with care because the HCN optical depth is a big issue that can affect the method. Hence, this tool should be used only after a careful analysis of the HCN spectrum, checking that no line, neither the main nor the hyperfine ones, present absorption features. We point out that the analysis of the emission of H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$, HC$_{3}$N, N$_{2}$H$^{+}$, and C$_{2}$H could be useful to trace and distinguish regions among IRDCs, HMPOs and HMCs. The molecular line widths of these four species increase from the IRDC to the HMC stage, which can be a consequence of the gas dynamics related to the star-forming processes taking place in the molecular clumps. Our results do not only contribute with more statistics regarding to probe such chemical tools, useful to obtain information in large samples of sources, but also complement previous works through the analysis on other types of sources.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analytical model for cosmological Lyman-limit systems (LLSs) that successfully reproduces the observed evolution of the mean free path (L) of ionizing photons. The evolution of the co-moving mean free path is predominantly a consequence of the changing meta galactic photo-ionization rate and the increase with cosmic time of the minimum mass below which halos lose their gas due to photo-heating. In the model, Lyman-limit absorption is caused by highly ionized gas in the outskirt of dark matter halos. We exploit the association with halos to compute statistical properties of LLSs and of their bias, b. The latter increases from 1.5 to 2.6 from redshifts 2 to 6. Combined with the rapid increase with redshift of the bias of the halos that host a quasar, the model predicts a rapid drop in the value of L when measured in quasar spectra from z=5 to 6, whereas the actual value of L falls more smoothly. We derive an expression for the effective optical depth due to Lyman limit absorption as a function of wavelength and show that it depends sensitively on the poorly constrained number density of LLSs as a function of column density. The optical depth drops below unity for all wavelengths below a redshift of 2.5, which is therefore the epoch when the Universe first became transparent to ionizing photons.
