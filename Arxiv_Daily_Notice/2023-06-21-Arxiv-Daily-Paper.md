 - **Abstract**
 A large fraction of white dwarfs (WDs) have metal-polluted atmospheres, which are produced by accreting material from remnant planetary systems. The composition of the accreted debris broadly resembles that of rocky Solar System objects. Volatile-enriched debris with compositions similar to long-period comets (LPCs) is rarely observed. We attempt to reconcile this dearth of volatiles with the premise that exo-Oort clouds (XOCs) occur around a large fraction of planet-hosting stars. We estimate the comet accretion rate from an XOC analytically, adapting the 'loss cone' theory of LPC delivery in the Solar System. We investigate the dynamical evolution of an XOC during late stellar evolution. Using numerical simulations, we show that 1 to 30 per cent of XOC objects remain bound after anisotropic stellar mass loss imparting a WD natal kick of $\sim$1 km/s. We also characterize the surviving comets' distribution function. Surviving planets orbiting a WD can prevent the accretion of XOC comets by the star. A planet's 'dynamical barrier' is effective at preventing comet accretion if the energy kick imparted by the planet exceeds the comet's orbital binding energy. By modifying the loss cone theory, we calculate the amount by which a planet reduces the WD's accretion rate. We suggest that the scarcity of volatile-enriched debris in polluted WDs is caused by an unseen population of 10-100 AU scale giant planets acting as barriers to incoming LPCs. Finally, we constrain the amount of volatiles delivered to a planet in the habitable zone of an old, cool WD.
#### Long-Term Evolution of Massive-Star Post-Common Envelope Circumbinary  Disks and the Environments of Fast Luminous Transients

 - **Abstract**
 If the envelope of a massive star is not entirely removed during common envelope (CE) interaction with an orbiting compact (e.g., black hole [BH] or neutron star [NS]) companion, the residual bound material eventually cools, forming a centrifugally-supported disk around the binary containing the stripped He core. We present a time-dependent height-integrated model for the long-term evolution of post-CE circumbinary disks (CBD), accounting for mass and angular momentum exchange with the binary and irradiation heating by the He core and photoevaporation wind mass-loss. A large fraction of the CBD's mass is accreted prior to its outwards viscous spreading and wind-dispersal on a timescale ~10^{4}-10^{5} yr, driving significant changes in the binary separation, even for disks containing ~ 10% of the original envelope mass. Insofar that the CBD lifetime is comparable to the thermal (and, potentially, nuclear) timescale of the He core, over which a second mass-transfer episode onto the companion can occur, the presence of the CBD could impact the stability of this key phase. Disruption of the He core by the BH/NS would result in a jetted energetic explosion into the dense gaseous CBD (<~10^{15} cm) and its wind (>~ 10^{16} cm), consistent with the environments of luminous fast blue optical transients like AT2018cow. Evolved He cores which undergo core-collapse still embedded in their CBD could generate Type Ibn/Icn supernovae. Thousands of dusty wind-shrouded massive-star CBD may be detectable as extragalactic luminous infrared sources with the Roman Space Telescope; synchrotron radio nebulae powered by the CBD-fed BH/NS may accompany these systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Seven rocky planets orbit the nearby dwarf star TRAPPIST-1, providing a unique opportunity to search for atmospheres on small planets outside the Solar System (Gillon et al., 2017). Thanks to the recent launch of JWST, possible atmospheric constituents such as carbon dioxide (CO2) are now detectable (Morley et al., 2017, Lincowski et al., 2018}. Recent JWST observations of the innermost planet TRAPPIST-1 b showed that it is most probably a bare rock without any CO2 in its atmosphere (Greene et al., 2023). Here we report the detection of thermal emission from the dayside of TRAPPIST-1 c with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on JWST at 15 micron. We measure a planet-to-star flux ratio of fp/fs = 421 +/- 94 parts per million (ppm) which corresponds to an inferred dayside brightness temperature of 380 +/- 31 K. This high dayside temperature disfavours a thick, CO2-rich atmosphere on the planet. The data rule out cloud-free O2/CO2 mixtures with surface pressures ranging from 10 bar (with 10 ppm CO2) to 0.1 bar (pure CO2). A Venus-analogue atmosphere with sulfuric acid clouds is also disfavoured at 2.6 sigma confidence. Thinner atmospheres or bare-rock surfaces are consistent with our measured planet-to-star flux ratio. The absence of a thick, CO2-rich atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1 c suggests a relatively volatile-poor formation history, with less than 9.5 +7.5 -2.3 Earth oceans of water. If all planets in the system formed in the same way, this would indicate a limited reservoir of volatiles for the potentially habitable planets in the system.
#### Multi-wavelength temporal variability of the blazar PKS 1510-089

 - **Abstract**
 We perform correlation and periodicity search analyses on long-term multi-band light curves of the FSRQ 1510-089 observed by the space-based Fermi--Large Area Telescope in gamma-rays, the SMARTS and Steward Observatory telescopes in optical and near-infrared (NIR) and the 13.7 m radio telescope in Metsahovi Radio Observatory between 2008 and 2018. The z-transform discrete correlation function method is applied to study the correlation and possible time lags among these multi band light curves. Among all pairs of wavelengths, the gamma-ray vs. optical/NIR and optical vs. NIR correlations show zero time lags; however, both the gamma-ray and optical/NIR emissions precede the radio radiation. The Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram, Weighted Wavelet Z-transform, and REDFIT techniques are employed to investigate the unresolved-core-emission dominated 37 GHz light curve and yield evidence for a quasi-period around 1540 days, although given the length of the whole data set it cannot be claimed to be significant. We also investigate the optical/NIR color variability and find that this source shows a simple redder-when-brighter behavior over time, even in the low flux state.
#### Properties of star formation of the Large Magellanic Cloud as probed by  young stellar objects

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a systematic study of evolutionary stages and stellar masses of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to investigate properties of star formation of the galaxy. There are 4825 sources in our YSO sample, which are constructed by combining the previous studies identifying YSOs in the LMC. Spectral energy distributions of the YSOs from optical to infrared wavelengths were fitted with a model consisting of stellar, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and dust emissions. We utilize the stellar-to-dust luminosity ratios thus derived to study the evolutionary stages of the sources; younger YSOs are expected to show lower stellar-to-dust luminosity ratios. We find that most of the YSOs are associated with the interstellar gas across the galaxy, which are younger with more gases, suggesting that more recent star formation is associated with larger amounts of the interstellar medium (ISM). N157 shows a hint of higher stellar-to-dust luminosity ratios between active star-forming regions in the LMC, suggesting that recent star formation in N157 is possibly in later evolutionary stages. We also find that the stellar mass function tends to be bottom-heavy in supergiant shells (SGSs), indicating that gas compression by SGSs may be ineffective in compressing the ISM enough to trigger massive star formation. There is no significant difference in the stellar mass function between YSOs likely associated with the interface between colliding SGSs and those with a single SGS, suggesting that gas compression by collisions between SGSs may also be ineffective for massive star formation.
#### Far-Ultraviolet to Near-Infrared Observations of SN 2023ixf: A high  energy explosion engulfed in complex circumstellar material

 - **Abstract**
 We present early-phase panchromatic photometric and spectroscopic coverage spanning far-ultraviolet (FUV) to the near-infrared (NIR) regime of the nearest hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernova in the last 25 years, SN~2023ixf. We observe early `flash' features in the optical spectra due to a confined dense circumstellar material (CSM). We observe high-ionization absorption lines Fe II, Mg II in the ultraviolet spectra from very early on. We also observe a multi-peaked emission profile of H-alpha in the spectrum beginning ~16 d, which indicates ongoing interaction of the SN ejecta with a pre-existing shell-shaped CSM having an inner radius of ~ 75 AU and an outer radius of ~140 AU. The shell-shaped CSM is likely a result of enhanced mass loss ~ 35 - 65 years before the explosion assuming a standard Red-Supergiant wind. Spectral modeling of the FUV, NUV, and the optical spectra during 9-12 d, using the radiative transfer spectrum synthesis code TARDIS indicates that the supernova ejecta could be well represented by a progenitor elemental composition greater than solar abundances. Based on early light curve models of Type II SNe, we infer that the nearby dense CSM confined to ~7+-3e14~cm(~45 AU) is a result of enhanced mass loss ~1e-(3.0+-0.5) Msol/yr two decades before the explosion.
#### Collapsing molecular clouds with tracer particles: Part II, Collapse  Histories

 - **Abstract**
 In order to develop a complete theory of star formation, one essentially needs to know two things: what collapses, and how long it takes. This is the second paper in a series, where we query how long a parcel of gas takes to collapse and the process it undergoes. We embed pseudo-Lagrangian tracer particles in simulations of collapsing molecular clouds, identify the particles that end in dense knots, and then examine the collapse history of the gas. We find a nearly universal behavior of cruise-then-collapse. We identify gas the moment before it collapses, $t_{\rm{sing}}$, and examine how it transitions to high density. We find that the time to collapse is uniformly distributed between $0.25 t_{\rm{ff}}$ and the end of the simulation at $\sim 1 t_{\rm{ff}}$, and that the collapse duration is universally short, $\Delta t \sim 0.1 t_{\rm{ff}}$. We find that the collapse of each core happens by a process akin to violent relaxation, wherein a fast reordering of the potential and kinetic energies occurs, in $0.1 t_{\rm{ff}}$, after which a virialized object remains. We describe the collapse in four stages; collection, hardening, singularity, and mosh. Collection sweeps low density gas into moderate density. Hardening brings kinetic and gravitational energies into quasi-equipartition. Singularity is the free-fall collapse, forming a virialized object in $\sim 0.1 t_{\rm{ff}}$. Mosh encompasses tidal dynamics of sub clumps and nearby cores during the collapse. In this work we focus primarily on isolated clumps. With this novel lens we can observe the details of collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 There is growing evidence that high-mass star formation and hub-filament systems (HFS) are intricately linked. The gas kinematics along the filaments and the forming high-mass star(s) in the central hub are in excellent agreement with the new generation of global hierarchical high-mass star formation models. In this paper, we present an observational investigation of a typical HFS cloud, G310.142+0.758 (G310 hereafter) which reveals unambiguous evidence of mass inflow from the cloud scale via the filaments onto the forming protostar(s) at the hub conforming with the model predictions. Continuum and molecular line data from the ATOMS and MALT90 surveys are used that cover different spatial scales. Three filaments (with total mass $5.7\pm1.1\times 10^3~M_{\odot}$) are identified converging toward the central hub region where several signposts of high-mass star formation have been observed. The hub region contains a massive clump ($1280\pm260~M_{\odot}$) harbouring a central massive core. Additionally, five outflow lobes are associated with the central massive core implying a forming cluster. The observed large-scale, smooth and coherent velocity gradients from the cloud down to the core scale, and the signatures of infall motion seen in the central massive clump and core, clearly unveil a nearly-continuous, multi-scale mass accretion/transfer process at a similar mass infall rate of $\sim 10^{-3}~M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$ over all scales, feeding the central forming high-mass protostar(s) in the G310 HFS cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Adaptive optics (AO) is now a tool commonly deployed in astronomy. The real time correction of the atmospheric turbulence that AO enables allows telescopes to perform close to the diffraction limit at the core of their point spread function (PSF). Among other factors, AO-corrected PSFs depend on the ability of the wavefront corrector (WFC), generally a deformable mirror, to fit the incident wavefront corrugations. Aims. In this work, we focus on this error introduced by the WFC, the so-called fitting error. To date, analytical models only depend on the WFC cut-off frequency, and Monte Carlo simulations are the only solution for studying the impact of the WFC influence function shape on the AO-corrected PSF. We aim to develop an analytical model accounting for the influence function shape. Methods. We first obtain a general analytical model of the fitting error structure function. With additional hypotheses, we then derive an analytical model of the AO-corrected power spectral density. These two analytical solutions are compared with Monte Carlo simulations on different ideal profiles (piston, pyramid, Gaussian) as well as with real hardware (DM192 from ALPAO). Results. Our analytical predictions show a very good agreement with the Monte Carlo simulations. We show that in the image plane, the depth of the correction as well as the transition profile between the AO-corrected area and the remaining turbulent halo depend on the influence functions of the WFC. We also show that the generally assumed hypothesis of stationarity of the AO correction is actually not met. Conclusions. As the fitting error is the intrinsic optimal limit of an AO system, our analytical model allows for the assessment of the theoretical limits of extreme AO systems limited by the WFC in high-contrast imaging through a context where other errors become comparable.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying chemistry and chemical composition is fundamental to go back to formation history of planetary systems. We propose here to have another look at five targets to better determine their composition and the chemical mechanisms that take place in their atmospheres. We present a re-analysis of five Hot Jupiters, combining multiple instruments and using Bayesian retrieval methods. We compare different combinations of molecules present in the simulated atmosphere, different chemistry types as well as different clouds parametrization. As a consequence of recent studies questioning the detection of Na and K in the atmosphere of HD 209458b as being potentially contaminated by stellar lines when present, we study the impact on other retrieval parameters of misinterpreting the presence of these alkali species. We use spatially scanned observations from the grisms G102 and G141 of the WFC3 on HST, with a wavelength coverage of $\sim$0.8 to $\sim$1.7 microns. We analyse these data with the publicly available Iraclis pipeline. We added to our datasets STIS observations to increase our wavelength coverage from $\sim$0.4 to $\sim$1.7 microns. We then performed a Bayesian retrieval analysis with the open-source TauREx using a nested sampling algorithm. We explore the influence of including Na and K on the retrieval of the molecules from the atmosphere. Our data re-analysis and Bayesian retrieval are consistent with previous studies but we find small differences in the retrieved parameters. After all, Na and K has no significant impact on the properties of the planet atmospheres. Therefore, we present here our new best-fit models, taking into account molecular abundances varying freely and equilibrium chemistry. This work is a preparation for a future addition of more sophisticated representation of chemistry taking into account disequilibrium effects such as vertical mixing and photochemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars expel large amounts of mass during their late evolutionary phases. We aim to unveil the physical conditions within the warm molecular environments of B[e] supergiants (B[e]SGs) and yellow hypergiants (YHGs), which are known to be embedded in circumstellar shells and disks. We present K-band spectra of two B[e]SGs from the Large Magellanic Cloud and four Galactic YHGs. The CO band emission detected from the B[e]SGs LHA 120-S 12 and LHA 120-S 134 suggests that these stars are surrounded by stable rotating molecular rings. The spectra of the YHGs display a rather diverse appearance. The objects 6 Cas and V509 Cas lack any molecular features. The star [FMR2006] 15 displays blue-shifted CO bands in emission, which might be explained by a possible close to pole-on oriented bipolar outflow. In contrast, HD 179821 shows blue-shifted CO bands in absorption. While the star itself is too hot to form molecules in its outer atmosphere, we propose that it might have experienced a recent outburst. We speculate that we currently can only see the approaching part of the expelled matter because the star itself might still block the receding parts of a (possibly) expanding gas shell.
#### The effect of tidal forces on the Jeans instability criterion in  star-forming regions

 - **Abstract**
 Recent works have proposed the idea of a tidal screening scenario, in which tidal forces determine the mass that a protostar can accrete to explain the IMF. In this scenario, gravitationally unstable fragments will compete for the gas reservoir in a star-forming clump. In this contribution, we propose to properly include the action of an external gravitational potential in the Jeans linear instability analysis as previously proposed by Jog. We have found that an external gravitational potential can reduce the critical mass required for the perturbation to collapse if the tidal force produced is compressive or increase it if it is disruptive. Our analytical treatment provides (a) new mass and length collapse conditions; (b) a simple equation for observers to check whether their observed fragments can collapse; and (c) a simple equation to compute whether collapse-induced turbulence can produce the levels of observed fragmentation. Our results suggest that, given envelopes with similar mass and density, the flatter ones should produce more stars than the steeper ones. If the density profile is a power-law, the corresponding power-law index separating these two regimes should be about 1.5. We finally applied our formalism to 160 fragments identified within 18 massive star-forming cores of previous works. We found that considering tides, 49% of the sample may be gravitationally unstable and that it is unlikely that turbulence acting at the moment of collapse has produced the fragmentation of these cores. Instead, these fragments should have formed earlier when the parent core was substantially flatter.

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamical instabilities among giant planets are thought to be nearly ubiquitous, and culminate in the ejection of one or more planets into interstellar space. Here we perform N-body simulations of dynamical instabilities while accounting for torques from the galactic tidal field. We find that a fraction of planets that would otherwise have been ejected are instead trapped on very wide orbits analogous to those of Oort cloud comets. The fraction of ejected planets that are trapped ranges from 1-10%, depending on the initial planetary mass distribution. The local galactic density has a modest effect on the trapping efficiency and the orbital radii of trapped planets. The majority of Oort cloud planets survive for Gyr timescales. Taking into account the demographics of exoplanets, we estimate that one in every 200-3000 stars could host an Oort cloud planet. This value is likely an overestimate, as we do not account for instabilities that take place at early enough times to be affected by their host stars' birth cluster, or planet stripping from passing stars. If the Solar System's dynamical instability happened after birth cluster dissolution, there is a ~7% chance that an ice giant was captured in the Sun's Oort cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we present the development of a dataset consisting of 91 Multi-band Cloud and Moisture Product Full-Disk (MCMIPF) from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on board GOES-16 geostationary satellite with 91 temporally and spatially corresponding CLDCLASS products from the CloudSat polar satellite. The products are diurnal, corresponding to the months of January and February 2019 and were chosen such that the products from both satellites can be co-located over South America. The CLDCLASS product provides the cloud type observed for each of the orbit's steps and the GOES-16 multiband images contain pixels that can be co-located with these data. We develop an algorithm that returns a product in the form of a table that provides pixels from multiband images labelled with the type of cloud observed in them. These labelled data conformed in this particular structure are very useful to perform supervised learning. This was corroborated by training a simple linear artificial neural network based on the work of Gorooh et al. (2020), which gave good results, especially for the classification of deep convective clouds.
#### On the Evolution of, and Hot Gas in, Wind-Blown Bubbles around Massive  Stars -- Wind Bubbles Are Not Energy-Conserving

 - **Abstract**
 The structure and evolution of wind-blown bubbles (WBBs) around massive stars has primarily been investigated using an energy-conserving model of wind-blown bubbles. While this model is useful in explaining the general properties of the evolution, several problems remain, including inconsistencies between observed wind luminosities and those derived using this formulation. Major difficulties include the low X-ray temperature and X-ray luminosity, compared to the model. In this paper, we re-examine the evolution, dynamics, and kinematics of WBBs around massive stars, using published ionization gasdynamic simulations of wind-blown bubbles. We show that WBBs can cool efficiently due to the presence of various instabilities and turbulence within the bubble. The expansion of WBBs is more consistent with a momentum-conserving solution, rather than an energy-conserving solution. This compares well with the dynamics and kinematics of observed wind bubbles. Despite the cooling of the bubble, the shocked wind temperature is not reduced to the observed values. We argue that the X-ray emission arise mainly from clumps and filaments within the hot shocked wind region, with temperatures just above 10$^6$ K. The remainder of the plasma can contribute to a lesser extent.
#### Exoplanet Interior Retrievals: core masses and metallicities from  atmospheric abundances

 - **Abstract**
 The mass and distribution of metals in the interiors of exoplanets are essential for constraining their formation and evolution processes. Nevertheless, with only masses and radii measured, the determination of exoplanet interior structures is degenerate, and so far simplified assumptions have mostly been used to derive planetary metallicities. In this work, we present a method based on a state-of-the-art interior code, recently used for Jupiter, and a Bayesian framework, to explore the possibility of retrieving the interior structure of exoplanets. We use masses, radii, equilibrium temperatures, and measured atmospheric metallicities to retrieve planetary bulk metallicities and core masses. Following results on the giant planets in the solar system and recent development in planet formation, we implement two interior structure models: one with a homogeneous envelope and one with an inhomogeneous one. Our method is first evaluated using a test planet and then applied to a sample of 37 giant exoplanets with observed atmospheric metallicities from the pre-JWST era. Although neither internal structure model is preferred with the current data, it is possible to obtain information on the interior properties of the planets, such as the core mass, through atmospheric measurements in both cases. We present updated metal mass fractions, in agreement with recent results on giant planets in the solar system.
#### The $γ$-process nucleosynthesis in core-collapse supernovae. I. A  novel analysis of $γ$-process yields in massive stars

 - **Abstract**
 The $\gamma$-process nucleosynthesis in core-collapse supernovae is generally accepted as a feasible process for the synthesis of neutron-deficient isotopes beyond iron. However, crucial discrepancies between theory and observations still exist: the average production of $\gamma$-process yields from massive stars are too low to reproduce the solar distribution in galactic chemical evolution calculations, and the yields of the Mo and Ru isotopes are by a further factor of 10 lower than the yields of the other $\gamma$-process nuclei. We investigate the $\gamma$-process in 5 sets of core-collapse supernova models published in literature with initial masses 15, 20, and 25 M$_{\odot}$ at solar metallicity. We compared the $\gamma$-process overproduction factors from the different models. To highlight the possible effect of nuclear physics input, we also considered 23 ratios of two isotopes close to each other in mass, relative to their solar values. Further, we investigated the contribution of C-O shell mergers in the supernova progenitors as an additional site of the $\gamma$-process. Our analysis shows that a large scatter among the different models exists for both the $\gamma$-process integrated yields and the isotopic ratios. We found only 10 ratios that agree with their solar values, all the others differ by at least a factor of 3 from the solar values in all the considered sets of models. The $\gamma$-process within C-O shell mergers mostly influence the isotopic ratios that involve intermediate and heavy proton-rich isotopes with $\rm A>100$.

 Planetesimal formation is still mysterious. One of the ways to form planetesimals is to invoke a gas pressure bump in a protoplanetary disc. In our previous paper, we propose a new scenario in which the piled-up dust at a gas pressure bump created by a migrating planet form planetesimals by streaming instability in a wide region of the disc as the planet migrates inward. In this work, we consider the global time evolution of dust and investigate the detailed conditions and results of the planetesimal formation in our scenario. We use a 1D grid single-sized dust evolution model, which can follow the growth of the particles by their mutual collision and their radial drift and diffusion. We calculate the time-evolution of the radial distribution of the peak mass and surface density of the dust in a gas disc perturbed by an embedded migrating planet and investigate if the dust satisfies the condition for planetesimal formation. We find that planetesimals form in a belt-like region between the snowline and the position where the planet reaches its pebble-isolation mass when the strength of turbulence is $10^{-4}\leq\alpha\leq10^{-3}$, which is broadly consistent with observed value. The mechanism of the formation, streaming instability or mutual collision, depends on the timescale of the streaming instability. The total mass of planetesimals also depends on $\alpha$ and is about $30-100~M_{\rm E}$ if the planetary core has already existed at the beginning and grows by gas accretion, but it decreases as the timing of the formation of the planetary core is later. We also provide simple approximate expressions of the surface density and total mass of the planetesimals and find that the total mass strongly depends on the dust mass. We show that planetesimals form in a belt-like region by the combination of the dust pile-up at the gas pressure bump formed by a planet and its inward migration.

 - **Abstract**
 The bulk kinematics and thermodynamics of hot supernovae-driven galactic winds is critically dependent on both the amount of swept up cool clouds and non-spherical collimated flow geometry. However, accurately parameterizing these physics is difficult because their functional forms are often unknown, and because the coupled non-linear flow equations contain singularities. We show that deep neural networks embedded as individual terms in the governing coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can robustly discover both of these physics, without any prior knowledge of the true function structure, as a supervised learning task. We optimize a loss function based on the Mach number, rather than the explicitly solved-for 3 conserved variables, and apply a penalty term towards near-diverging solutions. The same neural network architecture is used for learning both the hidden mass-loading and surface area expansion rates. This work further highlights the feasibility of neural ODEs as a promising discovery tool with mechanistic interpretability for non-linear inverse problems.
