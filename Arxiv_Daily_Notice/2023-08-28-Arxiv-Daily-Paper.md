 - **Abstract**
 We present the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN 2022oqm, a nearby multi-peaked hydrogen- and helium-weak calcium-rich transient (CaRT). SN 2022oqm was detected 19.9 kpc from its host galaxy, the face-on spiral galaxy NGC 5875. Extensive spectroscopic coverage reveals a hot (T >= 40,000 K) continuum and carbon features observed ~1 day after discovery, SN Ic-like photospheric-phase spectra, and strong forbidden calcium emission starting 38 days after discovery. SN 2022oqm has a relatively high peak luminosity (MB = -17 mag) for CaRTs, making it an outlier in the population. We determine that three power sources are necessary to explain SN 2022oqm's light curve, with each power source corresponding to a distinct peak in its light curve. The first peak of the light curve is powered by an expanding blackbody with a power law luminosity, consistent with shock cooling by circumstellar material. Subsequent peaks are powered by a double radioactive decay model, consistent with two separate sources of photons diffusing through an optically thick ejecta. From the optical light curve, we derive an ejecta mass and 56Ni mass of ~0.89 solar masses and ~0.09 solar masses, respectively. Detailed spectroscopic modeling reveals ejecta that is dominated by intermediate-mass elements, with signs that Fe-peak elements have been well-mixed. We discuss several physical origins for SN 2022oqm and favor a white dwarf progenitor model. The inferred ejecta mass points to a surprisingly massive white dwarf, challenging models of CaRT progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results obtained from follow-up observations of the MUSE Ultra Deep Field (MUDF) at X-ray energies with XMM-Newton. The MUDF is centred on a unique field with two bright, physically associated quasars at $z\simeq3.23$, separated by $\sim$500 kpc in projection. Both quasars are embedded within extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae ($\gtrsim 100~\rm kpc$ at a surface brightness flux level of $\approx 6\times 10^{-19} \rm erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}~arcsec^{-2}$), whose elongated morphology is suggestive of an extended filament connecting the quasar haloes. The new X-ray observations presented here allow us to characterise the physical properties (e.g. X-ray slope, luminosities, gas column densities) in the innermost region of the MUDF quasars. We find that both quasars are X-ray underluminous compared to objects at similar ultraviolet luminosities. Based on our X-ray spectral analysis, absorbing columns of $N_H(z)\gtrsim$ 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ appear unlikely, therefore such a weakness is possibly intrinsic. When also including literature data, we do not observe any detectable trend between the area of the nebulae and nuclear luminosities at both the rest-frame 2 keV and 2500 $\rm \mathring{A}$. The area is also not correlated with the X-ray photon index nor with the integrated band flux in the hard band (2$-$10 keV). We also do not find any trend between the extended Ly$\alpha$ emission of the nebulae and the nuclear X-ray luminosity. Finally, the properties of the MUDF quasars' nebulae are consistent with the observed relation between the Ly$\alpha$ integrated luminosity of the nebulae and their area. Our results suggest that the quasar ionization power is not a strong driver of the morphology and size of the nebulae.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic analysis of the X-ray emission of a sample of 17 optically selected, X-ray-detected tidal disruption events (TDEs) discovered between 2014 and 2021. The X-ray light curves show a diverse range of temporal behaviors, with most sources not following the expected power-law decline. The X-ray spectra are mostly extremely soft and consistent with thermal emission from the inner region of an accretion disk that cools as the accretion rate decreases. Three sources show the formation of a hard X-ray corona around 200 days after the UV/optical peak. The shape of the spectral energy distribution, traced by the ratio ($L_{\rm BB}/L_{\rm X}$) between the UV/optical and X-ray luminosities, shows a wide range $L_{\rm BB}/L_{\rm X} \in (0.5, 3000)$ at early-times, and converges to disk-like values $L_{\rm BB}/L_{\rm X} \in (0.5, 10)$ at late-times. The evolution of the derived physical parameters favors a decrease in the optical depth of a reprocessing layer instead of delayed disk formation to explain the late-time X-ray brightening found in several sources. We estimate the fraction of optically discovered TDEs with $L_{\rm X}\geq 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to be at least $40\%$, and find that the X-ray loudness is independent of black hole mass. We combine our sample with those from X-ray surveys to construct an X-ray luminosity function, best fitted by a broken power-law with a brake at $\sim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We show that there is no dichotomy between optically and X-ray selected TDEs; instead, there is a continuum of early time $L_{\rm BB}/L_{\rm X}$, at least as wide as $L_{\rm BB}/L_{\rm X} \in (0.1, 3000)$, with optical/X-ray surveys selecting preferentially, but not exclusively, from the higher/lower end of the distribution. Our findings are consistent with an orientation-dependent and time-evolving reprocessing layer, and support viewing-angle unification models.

 - **Abstract**
 Populations of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in globular clusters (GCs) influence their dynamical evolution and have important implications on one of the main formation channels for gravitational wave sources. Inferring the size of these populations remains difficult, however. In this work, multimass models of 34 Milky Way GCs, first presented in Dickson et al., are used to explore the present-day BH populations of a large sample of clusters. Direct constraints on both the total and visible mass components provided by several observables allow these models to accurately determine the distribution of the dark mass (including BHs) within clusters, as we demonstrate in a proof-of-concept fitting of the models to mock observations extracted from Monte Carlo cluster models. New constraints on the BH population retained to the present-day in each cluster are inferred from our models. We find that BH mass fractions ranging from 0 to 1 per cent of the total mass are typically required to explain the observations, except for Omega Cen, for which we infer a mass fraction of 5 per cent, in agreement with previous works. Relationships between the dark remnant populations and other cluster parameters are examined, demonstrating a clear anti-correlation between the amount of BHs and mass segregation between visible stars, as well as a correlation between remnant mass fractions and the dynamical age of clusters. Our inferred BH populations are in good agreement overall with other recent studies using different methodologies, but with notable discrepancies for individual clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 The demographics of young exoplanets can shed light onto their formation and evolution processes. Exoplanet properties are derived from the properties of their host stars. As such, it is important to accurately characterize the host stars since any systematic biases in their derivation can negatively impact the derivation of planetary properties. Here, we present a uniform catalog of photometrically-derived stellar effective temperatures, luminosities, radii, and masses for 4,865 young (<1 Gyr) stars in 31 nearby clusters and moving groups within 200 pc. We compared our photometrically-derived properties to a subset of those derived from spectra, and found them to be in good agreement. We also investigated the effect of stellar properties on the detection efficiency of transiting short-period young planets with TESS as calculated in Fernandes et al. 2022, and found an overall increase in the detection efficiency when the new photometrically derived properties were taken into account. Most notably, there is a 1.5 times increase in the detection efficiencies for sub-Neptunes/Neptunes (1.8-6 Re) implying that, for our sample of young stars, better characterization of host star properties can lead to the recovery of more small transiting planets. Our homogeneously derived catalog of updated stellar properties, along with a larger unbiased stellar sample and more detections of young planets, will be a crucial input to the accurate estimation of the occurrence rates of young short-period planets.

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming Comet Interceptor mission involves a parking phase around the Sun-Earth L2 point before transferring to intercept the orbit of a long period comet, interstellar object or a back-up target in the form of a short-period comet. The target is not certain to be known before the launch in 2029. During the parking phase there may thus arise a scenario wherein a decision needs to be taken of whether to go for a particular comet or whether to discard that option in the hope that a better target will appear within a reasonable time frame later on. We present an expectation value-based formalism that could aid in the associated decision making provided that outlined requirements for its implementation exist.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of nearly two decades of optical/UV and X-ray data to study the multi-wavelength pre-explosion properties and post-explosion X-ray properties of nearby SN2023ixf located in M101. We find no evidence of precursor activity in the optical to UV down to a luminosity of $\lesssim 7\times10^{4}\, \rm L_{\odot}$, while X-ray observations covering nearly 18 years prior to explosion show no evidence of luminous precursor X-ray emission down to an absorbed 0.3 - 10.0 keV X-ray luminosity of $\sim6\times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Extensive Swift observations taken post-explosion did not detect soft X-ray emission from SN2023ixf within the first $\sim$3.3 days after first light, which suggests a mass-loss rate for the progenitor of $\lesssim5\times10^{-4}\,\rm M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ or a radius of $\lesssim4\times10^{15}$ cm for the circumstellar material. Our analysis also suggests that if the progenitor underwent a mass-loss episode, this had to occur $>$ 0.5 - 1.5 years prior to explosion, consistent with previous estimates. Swift detected soft X-rays from SN2023ixf $\sim4.25$ days after first light, and it rose to a peak luminosity of $\sim10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ after 10 days and has maintained this luminosity for nearly 50 days post first light. This peak luminosity is lower than expected, given the evidence that SN2023ixf is interacting with dense material. However, this might be a natural consequence of an asymmetric circumstellar medium. X-ray spectra derived from merging all Swift observations over the first 50 days are best described by a two-component bremsstrahlung model consisting of a heavily absorbed and hotter component similar to that found using NuSTAR, and a less-absorbed, cooler component. We suggest that this soft component arises from cooling of the forward shock similar to that found in Type IIn SN2010jl.
#### Nonthermal hydrogen loss at Mars: Contributions of photochemical  mechanisms to escape and identification of key processes

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrogen loss to space is a key control on the evolution of the Martian atmosphere and the desiccation of the red planet. Thermal escape is thought to be the dominant loss process, but both forward modeling studies and remote sensing observations have indicated the presence of a second, higher-temperature "nonthermal" or "hot" hydrogen component, some fraction of which also escapes. Exothermic reactions and charge/momentum exchange processes produce hydrogen atoms with energy above the escape energy, but H loss via many of these mechanisms has never been studied, and the relative importance of thermal and nonthermal escape at Mars remains uncertain. Here we estimate hydrogen escape fluxes via 47 mechanisms, using newly-developed escape probability profiles. We find that HCO$^+$ dissociative recombination is the most important of the mechanisms, accounting for 30-50% of the nonthermal escape. The reaction CO$_2^+$ + H$_2$ is also important, producing roughly as much escaping H as momentum exchange between hot O and H. Total nonthermal escape from the mechanisms considered amounts to 39% (27%) of thermal escape, for low (high) solar activity. Our escape probability profiles are applicable to any thermospheric hot H production mechanism and can be used to explore seasonal and longer-term variations, allowing for a deeper understanding of desiccation drivers over various timescales. We highlight the most important mechanisms and suggest that some may be important at Venus, where nonthermal escape dominates and much of the literature centers on charge exchange reactions, which do not result in significant escape in this study.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent numerical simulations have revealed that dust clumping and planetesimal formation likely proceed in ring-like disc substructures, where dust gets trapped in weakly turbulent pressure maxima. The streaming instability has difficulty operating in such rings with external turbulence and no pressure gradient. To explore potential paths to planetesimal formation in this context, we analyse the stability of turbulent dust-trapping ring under the shearing sheet framework. We self-consistently establish the pressure maximum and the dust ring in equilibrium, the former via a balance of external forcing versus viscosity and the latter via dust drift versus turbulent diffusion. We find two types of $\gtrsim H$-scale instabilities ($H$ being the pressure scale height), which we term the dusty Rossby wave instability (DRWI). Type I is generalised from the standard RWI, which is stationary at the pressure maximum and dominates in relatively sharp pressure bumps. Type II is a newly identified travelling mode that requires the presence of dust. It can operate in relatively mild bumps, including many that are stable to the standard RWI, and its growth rate is largely determined by the equilibrium gas and dust density gradients. We further conduct two-fluid simulations that verify the two types of the DRWI. While Type I leads strong to dust concentration into a large gas vortex similar to the standard RWI, the dust ring is preserved in Type II, and meanwhile exhibiting additional clumping within the ring. The DRWI suggests a promising path towards formation of planetesimals/planetary embryos and azimuthally asymmetric dust structure from turbulent dust-trapping rings.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) is a field that has long been within the domain of traditional signal processing techniques. However, with the advent of powerful generative AI models, such as GPT-3, we are now able to explore new ways of analyzing SETI data and potentially uncover previously hidden signals. In this work, we present a novel approach for using generative AI to analyze SETI data, with focus on data processing and machine learning techniques. Our proposed method uses a combination of deep learning and generative models to analyze radio telescope data, with the goal of identifying potential signals from extraterrestrial civilizations. We also discuss the challenges and limitations of using generative AI in SETI, as well as potential future directions for this research. Our findings suggest that generative AI has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and we encourage further exploration of this approach in the SETI community.

#### Angular Momentum Loss During Stable Mass Transfer onto a Compact object:  the Effect of Mass Loss via Accretion Disk Winds

 - **Abstract**
 We use an analytic framework to calculate the evolution of binary orbits under a physically-motivated model that accounts for angular momentum loss associated with winds from an accretion disk around the compact objected accretor. Our prescription considers wind mass ejection from the surface of an accretion disk, accounting for a radial mass-loss dependence across the disk surface. We compare this to the standard prescription of angular momentum loss associated with isotropic mass loss from the vicinity of the accretor. The angular momentum loss from a disk-wind is always larger. For mass ratios, $q$, between $2$--$10$, angular momentum loss via a disk wind is $\simeq3$--$40$ times greater than the standard prescription. For the majority of mass ratios and disk properties, accounting for the disk wind can result in considerably smaller orbital separations compared to the standard formalism; the differences being $\simeq 60\%$ depending on how long the effect is integrated for. We conclude that it is important to consider the effects of angular momentum loss from a disk wind when evolving binary orbits.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the Seventh Data Release (DR7) quasar catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we investigate the variability of optical quasars in W1, W2, W3 and W4 bands of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE). Adopting the structure function method, we calculate the structure function ($\rm\delta t$=1 yr) which shows no obvious correlations with the bolometric luminosity, the black hole mass and the Eddington ratio. The ensemble structure functions in W1 and W2 bands show that the SF slopes are steeper than those in previous studies which may be caused by different cadence and observational epoch number. We further investigate the relation of variability amplitude $\sigma_m$ between mid-infrared band and optical band, but no obvious correlation is found. No correlation is found between W1-W2 and g-r color. We think the mid-infrared emission of quasars may be smoothed out by the extended dust distribution, thus leading to no obvious correlation. For the radio-loud quasar sub-sample, we further analyze the relation between the variability amplitude in the mid-infrared band and the radio luminosity at 6 cm, but no obvious correlations are found, which indicate the mid-infrared emission contributed from the synchrotron radiation of the relativistic jet is very weak.

 - **Abstract**
 We have studied the evolution of HuBi 1-like planetary nebulae, considering several stages of mass injection. We have carried out numerical ionization+1D hydrodynamics+atomic/ionic rate models with our code Coral 1D to reproduce planetary nebulae that present multiple shells produced by different ejection events around the ionizing source. Furthermore, we are interested in comparing numerical simulations with H$\alpha$ and [NII]$\lambda$6584 emission structures and the position-velocity diagrams observed in HuBi 1. This object also has a phase where it has drastically decreased the injection of ionized photons ejected from the source. The result of these different stages of ejection is a nebula with intense [NII] line emission in the inner part of the planetary nebula and an extended HII recombination line emission around the central zone. The model for HuBi 1 shows the capability of our code to explain the hydrodynamical and photoionization evolution in ionization nebulae. This is our first step with a 1D code to study these two physical phenomena at the same time.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the spectrum of gravitational waves arising from primordial inflation in the presence of a string-theoretical higher curvature correction, specifically, the Gauss-Bonnet coupling term for the inflaton (modulus) field. We show that if the modulus field exhibits a wall-crossing like behavior in the moduli space, there can be a period of Gauss-Bonnet coupling term domination during the usual slow-roll. This phenomenon is potentially detectable as the gravitational wave spectrum exhibits a characteristic peak caused by the brief domination of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling term. We explore the possibility of measuring such gravitational waves with pulsar timing array experiments such as NANOGrav, and future space-borne interferometers such as LISA, DECIGO, and Taiji.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) is a telescope array that observes the cosmic microwave background (CMB) over ~75% of the sky from the Atacama Desert, Chile, at frequency bands centered near 40, 90, 150, and 220 GHz. CLASS measures the large angular scale CMB polarization to constrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the optical depth to last scattering. This paper presents the optical characterization of the 90GHz telescope, which has been observing since July 2018. Observations of the Moon establish the pointing while dedicated observations of Jupiter are used for beam calibration. The standard deviations of the pointing error in azimuth, elevation, and boresight angle are 1.3, 2.1, and 2.0 arcminutes, respectively, over the first 3 years of observations. This corresponds to a pointing uncertainty ~7% of the beam's full width at half maximum (FWHM). The effective azimuthally-symmetrized 1D beam estimated at 90 GHz from per detector intensity beam maps has a FWHM of 0.614+/-0.003 deg and a solid angle of 136.3+/-0.6(stats.)+/-1.1(sys.) usr integrated to a radius of 4 deg. The corresponding beam window function drops to b_ell^2 = 0.92, 0.70, 0.14 at ell = 30, 100, 300, respectively, with relative uncertainties < 2% for ell < 200. Far-sidelobes are studied using detector-centered intensity maps of the Moon and measured to be at a level of 10^-3 or below relative to the peak. The polarization angle of Tau A estimated from preliminary survey maps is 149.6+/-0.2(stats.) deg in equatorial coordinates consistent with prior measurements. Instrumental temperature-to-polarization (T-to-P) leakage is measured at a 95% confidence upper limit of (1.7+/-0.1) x 10^-3 in single detector demodulated data using observations of Jupiter and the Moon. Using pair-differenced demodulated data, a 95% confidence upper limit of 3.6 x 10^-4 is obtained on the T-to-P leakage.

 We followed-up with ESPRESSO the K0V star HIP 29442 (TOI-469), already known to host a validated sub-Neptune companion TOI-469.01. We aim to verify the planetary nature of TOI-469.01. We modelled radial velocity and photometric time series to measure the dynamical mass, radius, and ephemeris, and to characterise the internal structure and composition of TOI-469.01. We confirmed the planetary nature of TOI-469.01. Thanks to ESPRESSO we discovered two additional close-in companions. We also detected their low signal-to-noise transit signals in the TESS light curve. HIP 29442 is a compact multi-planet system, and the three planets have orbital periods $P_{\rm orb, b}=13.63083\pm0.00003$, $P_{\rm orb, c}=3.53796\pm0.00003$, and $P_{\rm orb, d}=6.42975^{+0.00009}_{-0.00010}$ days, and we measured their masses with high precision: $m_{\rm p, b}=9.6\pm0.8~M_{\oplus}$, $m_{\rm p, c}=4.5\pm0.3~M_{\oplus}$, and $m_{\rm p, d}=5.1\pm0.4~M_{\oplus}$. We measured radii and bulk densities of all the planets (the 3$\sigma$ confidence intervals are shown in parenthesis): $R_{\rm p, b}=3.48^{+0.07 (+0.19)}_{-0.08 (-0.28)} ~R_{\oplus}$ and $\rho_{\rm p, b}=1.3\pm0.2 (0.3) g~cm^{-3}$; $R_{\rm p, c}=1.58^{+0.10 (+0.30)}_{-0.11 (-0.34)}~R_{\oplus}$ and $\rho_{\rm p, c}=6.3^{+1.7 (+6.0)}_{-1.3 (-2.7)} g~cm^{-3}$; $R_{\rm p, d}=1.37\pm0.11^{(+0.32)}_{(-0.43)}~R_{\oplus}$ and $\rho_{\rm p, d}=11.0^{+3.4 (+21.0)}_{-2.4 (-6.3)} g~cm^{-3}$. We used the more conservative 3$\sigma$ confidence intervals for the radii as input to the interior structure modelling. We find that HIP 29442 $b$ appears as a typical sub-Neptune, likely surrounded by a gas layer of pure H-He with a mass of $0.27^{+0.24}_{-0.17} M_{\oplus}$ and a thickness of $1.4\pm0.5 R_{\oplus}$. For the innermost companions HIP 29442 $c$ HIP 29442 $d$, the model supports an Earth-like composition.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The metal mass fraction of the Sun Z is a key constraint in solar modelling, but its value is still under debate. The standard solar chemical composition of the late 2000s have the ratio of metals to hydrogen Z/X = 0.0181, with a small increase to 0.0187 in 2021, as inferred from 3D non-LTE spectroscopy. However, more recent work on a horizontally and temporally averaged <3D> model claim Z/X = 0.0225, consistent with the high values of twenty-five years ago based on 1D LTE spectroscopy. Aims. We aim to determine a precise and robust value of the solar metal mass fraction from helioseismic inversions, thus providing independent constraints from spectroscopic methods. Methods. We devise a detailed seismic reconstruction technique of the solar envelope, combining multiple inversions and equations of state to accurately and precisely determine the metal mass fraction value. Results. We show that a low value of the solar metal mass fraction corresponding to Z/X = 0.0187 is favoured by helioseismic constraints and that a higher metal mass fraction corresponding to Z/X = 0.0225 are strongly rejected by helioseismic data. Conclusions. We conclude that direct measurement of the metal mass fraction in the solar envelope favours a low metallicity, in line with the 3D non-LTE spectroscopic determination of 2021. A high metal mass fraction as measured using a <3D> model in 2022 is disfavoured by helioseismology for all modern equations of state used to model the solar convective envelope.

 - **Abstract**
 In very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray astronomy, the community is converging towards the use of a common open data format, called "Data formats for Gamma-ray Astronomy", for the high-level data products. This format is in use for ground-based TeV observatories like H.E.S.S., MAGIC or HAWC, some of whom plan to openly release high-level data products. These efforts are parallel to the development and use of open analysis software such as the Gammapy package. This open initiative has shown that it is possible to define common standards even without governance. With the advent of open VHE observatories (e.g. CTAO, KM3NeT) and an increase in both multi-wavelength and multi-messenger studies, such standards should evolve to support all of VHE multi-messenger astrophysics. For these reasons, a new initiative has been created to specify formats of high-level data from very and ultra high energy gamma-ray facilities and from VHE neutrino detectors. It also aims to better respect the FAIR principles and the IVOA recommendations.This communication will present the Very-high-energy Open Data Format (VODF) project that has been established by eleven VHE astroparticle facilities. Its structure, its organisation and its goal will be presented. Anchored in Open Science, our goal is to solicit comments and future contributions from the VHE astrophysics community.

 - **Abstract**
 Since its start in 2014, the lightweight open source Python library Gammapy has come a long way to become a popular data analysis package for high-energy astrophysics. Selected as the official CTAO Science Analysis tool, it is also an approved analysis software within the H.E.S.S. and MAGIC collaborations. The first long-term version, Gammapy v1.0 was released on late 2022. It is compliant with several well-established data conventions in high-energy astrophysics, and provides serialised data products that are interoperable with other software. Event lists and instrument response functions curated within the same format from various instruments can be reduced to data binned in energy, time or spatial coordinates. Thereafter, the flux and morphology of one or more gamma-ray sources can be estimated using Poisson maximum likelihood fitting and assuming a variety of spectral, temporal and spatial models. Flux points, likelihood profiles and light curves extractions are supported. Complex user defined likelihoods and models can also be implemented. In this contribution, we will highlight the main features of Gammapy v1.0, including data reduction and analysis examples from different space and ground-based instruments, applications of various background rejection techniques, and a simultaneous fitting across multiple instruments with astrophysical models. We will also present our plans for the future, showcasing new features such as the support of different event types, unbinned likelihood analysis, spectral unfolding and transient source detections. In addition to an improved API with distributed computing for scalable analysis, enhanced support for all-sky instruments like Fermi-LAT and HAWC is foreseen.
#### Unraveling the Effects of Dense Medium on a Near to Bohm-Limit  Acceleration in Kepler's SNR

 - **Abstract**
 The maximum energy of electrons accelerated by supernova remnants (SNR) is typically limited by radiative losses. In this scenario, the synchrotron cooling time scale is equal to the acceleration time scale. On the other hand, the low propagation speed of a shock in a dense medium is expected to result in an extended acceleration time scale, thus inducing a decrease in the maximum electron energy for a given SNR age and in the X-ray nonthermal flux. The young Kepler's SNR shows an enhanced efficiency of the acceleration process, which is close to the Bohm limit in the north of its shell, where the shock is slowed down by a dense circumstellar medium. Conversely, in the south, where no interaction with a dense medium is evident and the shock speed is high, the acceleration proceeds with a higher Bohm factor. To investigate this scenario, we studied the temporal evolution of the non-thermal emission, taking advantage of two Chandra X-ray observations of Kepler's SNR (performed in 2006 and 2014). We analyzed the spectra of different filaments both in the north and south of the shell, and measured their proper motion. We found a region with low shock velocity where we measured a significant decrease in flux from 2006 to 2014. This could be the first evidence of fading synchrotron emission in Kepler's SNR. This result suggests that under a certain threshold of shock speed the acceleration process could exit the loss-limited regime.
#### Cluster halo shapes in CDM and SIDM models: Unveiling the DM particle  nature using a weak lensing approach

 - **Abstract**
 Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) is an alternative to the standard collisionless cold dark matter model (CDM), allowing for interactions between the dark matter particles through the introduction of a self-scattering cross-section. However, the observable effects between these two scenarios are hard to detect. In this work we present a detailed analysis of an application of galaxy-galaxy lensing to measure with high precision the shapes of cluster halos and how this approach can be used to obtain information regarding the nature of the dark matter particle. Using two sets of simulated data, SIDM and CDM simulations, we compute stacked shear maps centred on several subsets of halos with masses $\gtrsim 10^{13.5} M_\odot$. From these maps, we obtain the quadrupole profiles related to the mean elongation of the particle distribution from which the shape parameters are derived. Accounting for a radial shape variation, this technique provides an enhancement of the observed differences between the simulated data-sets which successfully differentiate between the two cosmological scenarios. In particular, we obtain a larger slope of the shape-radial relation for the halos identified in the SIDM simulation, which are rounder towards the centre. Also, as approaching to the mean virial radius, the projected semi-axis ratios converge to similar values than in the CDM simulation. Moreover, we account for the impact of the neighbouring mass, where a more strongly elongated distributions is found for the halos in the SIDM simulation, indicating that under dark matter self interaction, the large scale structure imprints a more coherent accretion process.
#### EUSO-SPB2 Fluorescence Telescope in-flight performance and preliminary  results

 - **Abstract**
 The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon II (EUSO-SPB2) launched from Wanaka, New Zealand on May 13th 2023. Consisting of two optical telescopes, EUSO-SPB2 aimed to search for very high energy neutrinos (E>PeV) via Cherenkov radiation, and ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, E>EeV) via ultraviolet fluorescence. Building on the EUSO-Balloon (2014) and EUSO-SPB1 (2017) missions, the Fluorescence Telescope (FT) comprises 108 multi-anode photomultiplier tubes at the focus of a one meter entrance diameter Schmidt telescope. The FT pointed down at the atmosphere below the SPB's altitude of 33 km. The mission duration was planned to reach up to 100 days. Prior to flight, the instrument was extensively tested in the laboratory and in the field. These measurements, combined with simulations led to an expected peak energy sensitivity around 3 EeV. Combined with a three-times-larger field-of-view than previous EUSO balloon missions, this resulted in an expected observation rate of one UHECR shower per ten hours of observation. The FT was expected to perform the first measurement of UHECRs via fluorescence from sub-orbital space, but was unable to, due to a shortened flight. Nonetheless, these observations of EUSO-SPB2 serve as a stepping stone to future satellite-based missions, such as the Probe of Extreme MultiMessenger Astrophysics (POEMMA), with enormous exposure to the highest energy cosmic rays with all sky coverage. In this contribution we will discuss the performance of the FT in flight as well as preliminary results.

 - **Abstract**
 The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) is the most advanced balloon mission undertaken by the JEM-EUSO collaboration. EUSO-SPB2 is built on the experience of previous stratosphere missions, EUSO-Balloon and EUSO-SPB, and of the Mini-EUSO space mission currently active onboard the International Space Station. EUSO- SPB2 is equipped with two instruments: a fluorescence telescope aimed at registering ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with an energy above 2 EeV and a Cherenkov telescope built to measure direct Cherenkov emission from cosmic rays with energies above 1 PeV. The EUSO-SPB2 mission will provide pioneering observations on the path towards a space-based multi-messenger observatory. As such, a special attention was paid to the development of triggers and other software aimed at comprehensive data analysis. A whole number of methods based on machine learning (ML) and neural networks was developed during the construction of the experiment and a few others are under active development. Here we provide a brief review of the ML-based methods already implemented in the instrument and the ground software and report preliminary results on the ML-based reconstruction of UHECR parameters for the fluorescence telescope.
