 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies have proposed that the nuclear millimeter continuum emission observed in nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN) could be created by the same population of electrons that gives rise to the X-ray emission that is ubiquitously observed in accreting black holes. We present the results of a dedicated high spatial resolution ($\sim$60-100 milliarcsecond) ALMA campaign on a volume-limited ($<50$ Mpc) sample of 26 hard X-ray ($>10$ keV) selected radio-quiet AGN. We find an extremely high detection rate (25/26 or $94^{+3}_{-6}\%$), which shows that nuclear emission at mm-wavelenghts is nearly ubiquitous in accreting SMBHs. Our high-resolution observations show a tight correlation between the nuclear (1-23 pc) 100GHz and the intrinsic X-ray emission (1$\sigma$ scatter of $0.22$ dex). The ratio between the 100GHz continuum and the X-ray emission does not show any correlation with column density, black hole mass, Eddington ratio or star formation rate, which suggests that the 100GHz emission can be used as a proxy of SMBH accretion over a very broad range of these parameters. The strong correlation between 100GHz and X-ray emission in radio-quiet AGN could be used to estimate the column density based on the ratio between the observed 2-10keV ($F^{\rm obs}_{2-10\rm\,keV}$) and 100GHz ($F_{100\rm\,GHz}$) fluxes. Specifically, a ratio $\log (F^{\rm obs}_{2-10\rm\,keV}/F_{100\rm\,GHz})\leq 3.5$ strongly suggests that a source is heavily obscured [$\log (N_{\rm H}/\rm cm^{-2})\gtrsim 23.8$]. Our work shows the potential of ALMA continuum observations to detect heavily obscured AGN (up to an optical depth of one at 100GHz, i.e. $N_{\rm H}\simeq 10^{27}\rm\,cm^{-2}$), and to identify binary SMBHs with separations $<100$ pc, which cannot be probed by current X-ray facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 We present initial results from our JWST NIRSpec program to study the $\alpha$-abundances in the M31 disk. The Milky Way has two chemically-defined disks, the low-$\alpha$ and high-$\alpha$ disks, which are closely related to the thin and thick disks, respectively. The origin of the two populations and the $\alpha$-bimodality between them is not entirely clear, although there are now several models that can reproduce the observed features. To help constrain the models and discern the origin, we have undertaken a study of the chemical abundances of the M31 disk using JWST NIRSpec, in order to determine whether stars in M31's disk also show an $\alpha$-abundance bimodality. Approximately 100 stars were observed in our single NIRSpec field at a projected distance of 18 kpc from the M31 center. The 1-D extracted spectra have an average signal-to-noise ratio of 85 leading to statistical metallicity precision of 0.016 dex, $\alpha$-abundance precision of 0.012 dex, and a radial velocity precision 8 km/s. The initial results indicate that, in contrast to the Milky Way, there is no $\alpha$-bimodality in the M31 disk, and no low-$\alpha$ sequence. The entire stellar population falls along a single chemical sequence very similar to the MW's high-alpha component which had a high star formation rate. While this is somewhat unexpected, the result is not that surprising based on other studies that found the M31 disk has a larger velocity dispersion than the MW and is dominated by a thick component. M31 has had a more active accretion and merger history than the MW which might explain the chemical differences.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of DELVE 6, an ultra-faint stellar system identified in the second data release of the DECam Local Volume Exploration (DELVE) survey. Based on a maximum-likelihood fit to its structure and stellar population, we find that DELVE 6 is an old ($\tau > 9.8$ Gyr, at 95% confidence) and metal-poor ($\rm [Fe/H] < -1.17$ dex, at 95% confidence) stellar system with an absolute magnitude of $M_V = -1.5^{+0.4}_{-0.6}$ mag and an azimuthally-averaged half-light radius of $r_{1/2} =10^{+4}_{-3}$ pc. These properties are consistent with the population of ultra-faint star clusters uncovered by recent surveys. Interestingly, DELVE 6 is located at an angular separation of $\sim 10\deg$ from the center of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), corresponding to a three-dimensional physical separation of $\sim 20$ kpc given the system's observed distance ($D_{\odot} = 80$ kpc). This also places the system $\sim 35$ kpc from the center of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), lying within recent constraints on the size of the LMC's dark matter halo. We tentatively measure the proper motion of DELVE 6 using data from $\textit{Gaia}$, which we find supports a potential association between the system and the LMC/SMC. Although future kinematic measurements will be necessary to determine its origins, we highlight that DELVE 6 may represent only the second or third ancient ($\tau > 9$ Gyr) star cluster associated with the SMC, or one of fewer than two dozen ancient clusters associated with the LMC. Nonetheless, we cannot currently rule out the possibility that the system is a distant Milky Way halo star cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Whereas X-ray clusters are extensively used for cosmology, their idealistic modelling, through the hypotheses of spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium, are more and more being questioned. Along these lines, the soft X-ray emission detected in tens of clusters with ROSAT was found to be higher than what expected from the idealistic hot gas modelling, pointing to our incomplete understanding of these objects. Aims. Given that cluster environments are at the interface between the hot intra-cluster medium (ICM), warm circum-galactic medium (WCGM) and warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), we aim to explore the relative soft X-ray emission of different gas phases in circum-cluster environments. Method. By using the most massive halos in IllustrisTNG at z=0, we have predicted the hydrodynamical properties of the gas from cluster centers to their outskirts (5 R200), and modelled their X-ray radiation for various plasma phases. Results. First, we found that the radial profile of temperature, density, metallicity and clumpiness of the ICM are in good agreement with recent X-ray observations of clusters. Secondly, we have developed a method to predict the radial profile of soft X-ray emission in different bands, the column density of ions and the X-ray absorption lines (O VIII, O VII, Ne IX, and Ne IX) of warm-hot gas inside and around clusters. Conclusion. The warm gas (in the form of both WCGM and WHIM gas) is a strong emitter in soft X-ray bands, and is qualitatively consistent with the observational measurements. Our results suggest that the cluster soft excess is induced by the thermal emission of warm gas in the circum-cluster environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present fully general-relativistic three-dimensional numerical simulations of accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs (WDs). We evolve three different WD models (nonrotating, rotating at 80% and 99% of the Keplerian mass shedding limit) that collapse due to electron capture. For each of these models, we provide a detailed analysis of their gravitational waves (GWs), neutrinos and electromagnetic counterpart and discuss their detectability. Our results suggest that fast rotating AICs could be detectable up to a distance of 8 Mpc with third-generation GW observatories, and up to 1 Mpc with LIGO. AIC progenitors are expected to have large angular momentum due to their accretion history, which is a determining factor for their stronger GW emission compared to core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Regarding neutrino emission, we found no significant difference between AICs and CCSNe. In the electromagnetic spectrum, we find that AICs are two orders of magnitude fainter than type Ia supernovae. Our work places AICs as realistic targets for future multimessenger searches with third generation ground-based GW detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 We present UV/optical observations and models of supernova (SN) 2023ixf, a type II SN located in Messier 101 at 6.9 Mpc. Early-time ("flash") spectroscopy of SN 2023ixf, obtained primarily at Lick Observatory, reveals emission lines of H I, He I/II, C IV, and N III/IV/V with a narrow core and broad, symmetric wings arising from the photo-ionization of dense, close-in circumstellar material (CSM) located around the progenitor star prior to shock breakout. These electron-scattering broadened line profiles persist for $\sim$8 days with respect to first light, at which time Doppler broadened features from the fastest SN ejecta form, suggesting a reduction in CSM density at $r \gtrsim 10^{15}$ cm. The early-time light curve of SN2023ixf shows peak absolute magnitudes (e.g., $M_{u} = -18.6$ mag, $M_{g} = -18.4$ mag) that are $\gtrsim 2$ mag brighter than typical type II supernovae, this photometric boost also being consistent with the shock power supplied from CSM interaction. Comparison of SN 2023ixf to a grid of light curve and multi-epoch spectral models from the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN and the radiation-hydrodynamics code HERACLES suggests dense, solar-metallicity, CSM confined to $r = (0.5-1) \times 10^{15}$ cm and a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} = 10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. For the assumed progenitor wind velocity of $v_w = 50$ km s$^{-1}$, this corresponds to enhanced mass-loss (i.e., ``super-wind'' phase) during the last $\sim$3-6 years before explosion.
#### 2021 occultations and transits of Linus orbiting (22) Kalliope: I.  Polygonal and `cliptracing' algorithm

 - **Abstract**
 The satellite Linus orbiting the main-belt asteroid (22) Kalliope exhibited occultation and transit events in late 2021. A photometric campaign was organized and observations were taken by the TRAPPIST-South, SPECULOOS-Artemis, OWL-Net, and BOAO telescopes, with the goal to constrain models of this system. Our dynamical model is complex, with multipoles (up to the order $\ell = 2$), internal tides, and external tides. The model was constrained by astrometry (spanning 2001--2021), occultations, adaptive-optics imaging, calibrated photometry, as well as relative photometry. Our photometric model was substantially improved. A new precise (${<}\,0.1\,{\rm mmag}$) light curve algorithm was implemented, based on polygon intersections, which are computed exactly -- by including partial eclipses and partial visibility of polygons. Moreover, we implemented a `cliptracing' algorithm, based again on polygon intersections, in which partial contributions to individual pixels are computed exactly. Both synthetic light curves and synthetic images are then very smooth. Based on our combined solution, we confirmed the size of Linus, $(28\pm 1)\,{\rm km}$. However, this solution exhibits some tension between the light curves and the PISCO speckle-interferometry dataset. In most solutions, Linus is darker than Kalliope, with the albedos $A_{\rm w} = 0.40$ vs. $0.44$. This is confirmed on deconvolved images. A~detailed revision of astrometric data allowed us to revise also the $J_2 \equiv -C_{20}$ value of Kalliope. Most importantly, a~homogeneous body is excluded. For a differentiated body, two solutions exist: low-oblateness ($C_{20} \simeq -0.12$), with a~spherical iron core, and alternatively, high-oblateness ($C_{20} \simeq -0.22$) with an elongated iron core. These correspond to the low- and high-energy collisions, respectively, studied by means of SPH simulations in our previous work.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a radio multi-frequency ($\rm 3-340~GHz$) study of the blazar 3C~454.3. After subtracting the quiescent spectrum corresponding to optically thin emission, we found two individual synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) features in the wide-band spectrum. The one SSA had a relatively low turnover frequency ($\nu_{\rm m}$) in the range of $\rm 3-37~GHz$ (lower $\nu_{\rm m}$ SSA spectrum, LSS), and the other one had a relatively high $\nu_{\rm m}$ of $\rm 55-124~GHz$ (higher $\nu_{\rm m}$ SSA spectrum, HSS). Using the SSA parameters, we estimated magnetic field strengths at the surface where optical depth $\tau=1$. The estimated magnetic field strengths were $\rm >7~mG$ and $\rm >0.2~mG$ for the LSS and HSS, respectively. The LSS emitting region was magnetically dominated before the June 2014 $\gamma$-ray flare. The quasi-stationary component (C), $\sim 0.6~{\rm mas}$ apart from the 43 GHz radio core, became brighter than the core with decreasing observing frequency, and we found that component C was related to the LSS. A decrease in jet width was found near component C. As a moving component, K14 approached component C, and the flux density of the component was enhanced while the angular size decreased. The high intrinsic brightness temperature in the fluid frame was obtained as $T_{\rm B, int} \approx (7.0\pm1.0) \times 10^{11}~{\rm K}$ from the jet component after the 2015 August $\gamma$-ray flare, suggesting that component C is a high-energy emitting region. The observed local minimum of jet width and re-brightening behavior suggest a possible recollimation shock in component C.
#### Investigating the OH-H2 relation in diffuse Galactic clouds

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the correlation between OH and H2 column densities in diffuse Galactic clouds, in order to identify potential molecular tracers of interstellar H2. For this, we analyse near-UV spectra extracted from the ESO/VLT archives towards seventeen sightlines (five of them new) with known N(H2), along with nine sightlines with no H2 information. N(OH) shows only marginal correlation with N(H2) (10$^{20}$ to 2 x 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$), at the 95 per cent confidence level. We use orthogonal distance regression analysis to obtain N(OH)/N(H2) = (1.32+/-0.15) x 10$^{-7}$, which is ~ 33 per cent higher than the previous estimates based on near-UV data. We also obtain N(CH)/N(H2) = (3.83+/-0.23) x 10$^{-8}$ and a significant correlation between N(OH) and N(CH), with N(OH) = (2.61+/-0.19) x N(CH), both of which are consistent with previous results. Comparison with predictions of numerical models indicate that OH absorption arises from diffuse gas (nH ~ 50 cm$^{-3}$) illuminated by radiation fields ~ 0.5-5 G0, while CH is associated with higher density of 500 cm$^{-3}$. We posit that the apparent dichotomy in the properties of the diffuse clouds giving rise to OH and CH absorption could be due to either (a) the presence of multiple spectroscopically unresolved clouds along the line-of-sight, or, (b) density gradients along the line-of-sight within a single cloud.
