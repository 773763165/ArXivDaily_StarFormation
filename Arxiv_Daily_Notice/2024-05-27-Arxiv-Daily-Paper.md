#### Title:
          TOI-1685 b is a Hot Rocky Super-Earth: Updates to the Stellar and Planet Parameters of a Popular JWST Cycle 2 Target

 - **Abstract**
 We present an updated characterization of the TOI-1685 planetary system, which consists of a P$_{\rm{b}}$ = 0.69\,day USP super-Earth planet orbiting a nearby ($d$ = 37.6\,pc) M2.5V star (TIC 28900646, 2MASS J04342248+4302148). This planet was previously featured in two contemporaneous discovery papers, but the best-fit planet mass, radius, and bulk density values were discrepant allowing it to be interpreted either as a hot, bare rock or a 50\% H$_{2}$O / 50\% MgSiO$_{3}$ water world. TOI-1685 b will be observed in three independent JWST cycle two programs, two of which assume the planet is a water world while the third assumes that it is a hot rocky planet. Here we include a refined stellar classification with a focus on addressing the host star's metallicity, an updated planet radius measurement that includes two sectors of TESS data and multi-color photometry from a variety of ground-based facilities, and a more accurate dynamical mass measurement from a combined CARMENES, IRD, and MAROON-X radial velocity data set. We find that the star is very metal-rich ([Fe/H] $\simeq$ +0.3) and that the planet is systematically smaller, lower mass, and higher density than initially reported, with new best-fit parameters of \Rpl = 1.468 $^{+0.050}_{-0.051}$ \Rearth\ and \Mpl = 3.03$^{+0.33}_{-0.32}$ \Mearth. These results fall in between the previously derived values and suggest that TOI-1685 b is a hot, rocky, planet with an Earth-like density (\Rhopl = 5.3 $\pm$ 0.8 g cm$^{-3}$, or 0.96 \rhoearth), high equilibrium temperature (T$_{\rm{eq}}$ = 1062 $\pm$ 27 K) and negligible volatiles, rather than a water world.

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents AstroPT, an autoregressive pretrained transformer developed with astronomical use-cases in mind. The AstroPT models presented here have been pretrained on 8.6 million $512 \times 512$ pixel $grz$-band galaxy postage stamp observations from the DESI Legacy Survey DR8. We train a selection of foundation models of increasing size from 1 million to 2.1 billion parameters, and find that AstroPT follows a similar saturating log-log scaling law to textual models. We also find that the models' performances on downstream tasks as measured by linear probing improves with model size up to the model parameter saturation point. We believe that collaborative community development paves the best route towards realising an open source `Large Observation Model' -- a model trained on data taken from the observational sciences at the scale seen in natural language processing. To this end, we release the source code, weights, and dataset for AstroPT under the MIT license, and invite potential collaborators to join us in collectively building and researching these models.
#### Title:
          Is the low-energy tail of shock-accelerated protons responsible for over-ionized plasma in supernova remnants?

 - **Abstract**
 Over-ionized, recombining plasma is an emerging class of X-ray bright supernova remnants (SNRs). This unique thermal state where the ionization temperature ($T_{\rm z}$) is significantly higher than the electron temperature ($T_{\rm e}$) is not expected from the standard evolution model assuming a point explosion in a uniform interstellar medium, requiring a new scenario for the dynamical and thermal evolution. A recently proposed idea attributes the over-ionization state to additional ionization contribution from the low-energy tail of shock-accelerated protons. However, this new scenario has been left untested, especially from the atomic physics point of view. We report calculation results of the proton impact ionization rates of heavy-element ions in ejecta of SNRs. We conservatively estimate the requirement for accelerated protons, and find that their relative number density to thermal electrons needs to be higher than $5~(T_{\rm e}/{\rm 1~keV})\%$ in order to explain the observed over-ionization degree at $T_{\rm z}/T_{\rm e} \ge 2$ for K-shell emission. We conclude that the proton ionization scenario is not feasible because such a high abundance of accelerated protons is prohibited by the injection fraction from thermal to non-thermal energies, which is expected to be $\sim 1\%$ at largest.

 - **Abstract**
 At high redshifts ($z\gtrsim12$), the relative velocity between baryons and dark matter (the so-called streaming velocity) significantly affects star formation in low-mass objects. Streaming substantially reduces the abundance of low-mass gas objects while simultaneously allowing for the formation of supersonically-induced gas objects (SIGOs) and their associated star clusters outside of dark matter halos. Here, we present a study of the population-level effects of streaming on star formation within both halos and SIGOs in a set of simulations with and without streaming. Notably, we find that streaming actually enhances star formation within individual halos of all masses at redshifts between $z=12$ and $z=20$. This is demonstrated both as an increased star formation rate per object as well as an enhancement of the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation for objects with streaming. We find that our simulations are consistent with some observations at high redshift, but on a population level, they continue to under-predict star formation relative to the majority of observations. However, simulations of overdense regions (both with and without streaming) agree with observations, suggesting a strategy for extracting information about the overdensity and streaming velocity in a given survey volume in future observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are designed to detect low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). GWs induce achromatic signals in PTA data, meaning that the timing delays do not depend on radio-frequency. However, pulse arrival times are also affected by radio-frequency dependent "chromatic" noise from sources such as dispersion measure (DM) and scattering delay variations. Furthermore, the characterization of GW signals may be influenced by the choice of chromatic noise model for each pulsar. To better understand this effect, we assess if and how different chromatic noise models affect achromatic noise properties in each pulsar. The models we compare include existing DM models used by NANOGrav and noise models used for the European PTA Data Release 2 (EPTA DR2). We perform this comparison using a subsample of six pulsars from the NANOGrav 15 yr data set, selecting the same six pulsars as from the EPTA DR2 six-pulsar dataset. We find that the choice of chromatic noise model noticeably affects the achromatic noise properties of several pulsars. This is most dramatic for PSR J1713+0747, where the amplitude of its achromatic red noise lowers from $\log_{10}A_{\text{RN}} = -14.1^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$ to $-14.7^{+0.3}_{-0.5}$, and the spectral index broadens from $\gamma_{\text{RN}} = 2.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ to $\gamma_{\text{RN}} = 3.5^{+1.2}_{-0.9}$. We also compare each pulsar's noise properties with those inferred from the EPTA DR2, using the same models. From the discrepancies, we identify potential areas where the noise models could be improved. These results highlight the potential for custom chromatic noise models to improve PTA sensitivity to GWs.

          Residual eccentricity as a systematic uncertainty on the formation channels of binary black holes

 - **Abstract**
 Resolving the formation channel(s) of merging binary black holes is a key goal in gravitational-wave astronomy. The orbital eccentricity is believed to be a precious tracer of the underlying formation pathway, but is largely dissipated during the usually long inspiral between black-hole formation and merger. Most gravitational-wave sources are thus expected to enter the sensitivity windows of current detectors on configurations that are compatible with quasi-circular orbits. In this paper, we investigate the impact of "negligible" residual eccentricity -- lower than currently detectable by LIGO/Virgo -- on our ability to infer the formation history of binary black holes, focusing in particular on their spin orientations. We trace the evolution of both observed and synthetic gravitational-wave events backward in time, while resampling their residual eccentricities to values that are below the detectability threshold. Eccentricities in-band as low as $\sim 10^{-4}$ can lead to significant biases when reconstructing the spin directions, especially in the case of loud, highly precessing systems. Residual eccentricity thus act like a systematic uncertainty for our astrophysical inference. As a mitigation strategy, one can marginalize the posterior distribution over the residual eccentricity using astrophysical predictions.

          First detection of X-ray pulsations and spectrum of the high Galactic latitude pulsar PSR J0837-2454 and direct Urca cooling implications

 - **Abstract**
 PSR J0837-2454 is a young 629 ms radio pulsar whose uncertain distance has important implications. A large distance would place the pulsar far out of the Galactic plane and suggest it is the result of a runaway star, while a short distance would mean the pulsar is extraordinarily cold. Here we present further radio observations and the first deep X-ray observation of PSR J0837-2454. Data from the Parkes Murriyang telescope show flux variations over short and long timescales and also yield an updated timing model, while the position and proper motion (and, less strongly, parallax) of the pulsar are constrained by a number of low-significance detections with the Very Long Baseline Array. XMM-Newton data enable detection of X-ray pulsations for the first time from this pulsar and yield a spectrum that is thermal and blackbody-like, with a cool blackbody temperature ~70 eV or atmosphere temperature ~50 eV, as well as a small hotspot. The spectrum also indicates the pulsar is at a small distance of <~1 kpc, which is compatible with the marginal VLBA parallax constraint that favours a distance of >~330 pc. The low implied X-ray luminosity (~3x10^31 erg s^-1 at 0.9 kpc) suggests PSR J0837-2454 has a mass high enough that fast neutrino emission from direct Urca reactions operates in this young star and points to a nuclear equation of state that allows for direct Urca reactions at the highest densities present in neutron star cores.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysics demands higher precision in measurements across photometry, spectroscopy, and astrometry. Several science cases necessitate not only precision but also a high level of accuracy. We highlight the challenges involved, particularly in achieving spectral fidelity, which refers to our ability to accurately replicate the input spectrum of an astrophysical source. Beyond wavelength calibration, this encompasses correcting observed spectra for atmospheric, telescope, and instrumental signatures. Elevating spectral fidelity opens avenues for addressing fundamental questions in physics and astrophysics. We delve into specific science cases, critically analyzing the prerequisites for conducting crucial observations. Special attention is given to the requirements for spectrograph detectors, their calibrations and data reduction. Importantly, these considerations align closely with the needs of photometry and astrometry.

 - **Abstract**
 Axion-inflation models are a compelling candidate as a mechanism behind the accelerated expansion in the early universe in light of the possibility to embed them in higher dimensional UV complete theories and the exciting prospect of testing them with next-generation cosmological probes. Adding an Abelian gauge sector to axion-inflation models makes for a rich, interesting, phenomenology spanning from primordial black holes to gravitational waves (GWs). Several recent studies employ an approximate analytic (Gaussian) template to characterize the effect of gauge field production on cosmological perturbations. In this work we go beyond such approximation and numerically study particle production and the ensuing scalar and tensor spectra. We find a significant deviation from results based on log-normally distributed vector field excitations. As an important phenomenological application of the improved method, we study the expected chirality and spectral index of the sourced GW background at scales relevant for current and next-generation GW detectors. One striking feature is that of a scale-dependent chirality. We derive a consistency relation between these two observables that can serve as an important tool in identifying key signatures of multi-field dynamics in axion inflation.

 - **Abstract**
 NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has identified over 7,000 candidate exoplanets via the transit method, with gas giants among the most readily detected due to their large radii. Even so, long intervals between TESS observations for much of the sky lead to candidates for which only a single transit is detected in one TESS sector, leaving those candidate exoplanets with unconstrained orbital periods. Here, we confirm the planetary nature of TIC 393818343 b, originally identified via a single TESS transit, using radial velocity data and ground-based photometric observations from citizen scientists with the Unistellar Network and Exoplanet Watch. We determine a period of $P$ = 16.24921 $\substack{+0.00010 \\ -0.00011}$ days, a mass $M_{P}$ = 4.34 $\pm$ 0.15 $M_{J}$, and semi-major axis $a$ = 0.1291 $\substack{+0.0021 \\ -0.0022}$ au, placing TIC 393818343 b in the "warm Jupiter" population of exoplanets. With an eccentricity $e$ = 0.6058 $\pm$ 0.0023, TIC 393818343 b is the most eccentric warm Jupiter to be discovered by TESS orbiting less than 0.15 au from its host star and therefore an excellent candidate for follow-up, as it may inform our future understanding of how hot and warm Jupiter populations are linked.

 - **Abstract**
 On 18 May 2024, a superbolide traversed the western part of the Iberian Peninsula, culminating its flight over the Atlantic Ocean and generating significant media attention. This event was caused by a weak carbonaceous meteoroid of 93.0$\pm$0.8 cm, with a density of 1613$\pm$12 kg\,m$^{-3}$, entering the atmosphere at 40.1$\pm$0.4 km\,s$^{-1}$ with an angle of 10.93$\pm$0.02$^\circ$. The luminous phase started at 137.88$\pm$0.05 km and ended at an altitude of 53.78$\pm$0.07 km. The meteoroid's heliocentric orbit was characterized by an inclination of 14.42$\pm$0.23$^\circ$, a high eccentricity of 0.950$\pm$0.004, a semi-major axis of 2.31$\pm$0.13 au, and a notably short perihelion distance of 0.116$\pm$0.003 au. The superbolide was recorded by multiple ground-based stations of the Spanish Meteor Network (SPMN), the European Space Agency (ESA), and the U.S. Government (USG) space sensors. Our analysis shows a good agreement with the radiant and velocity data reported by the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), with a deviation of 1.6$^\circ$ and -0.4 km\,s$^{-1}$, respectively. Due to the absence of observable deceleration, we successfully reconciled satellite radiometric data with a purely dynamic atmospheric flight model, constraining the meteoroid's mass and coherently fitting its velocity profile.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the nature of the luminous 1991T-like supernovae is of great importance to supernova cosmology as they are likely to have been more common in the early universe. In this paper we explore the observational properties of 1991T-like supernovae to study their relationship to other luminous, slow-declining Type~Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). From the spectroscopic and photometric criteria defined in Phillips et al. (1992), we identify 17 1991T-like supernovae from the literature. Combining these objects with ten 1991T-like supernovae from the Carnegie Supernova Project-II, the spectra, light curves, and colors of these events, along with their host galaxy properties, are examined in detail. We conclude that 1991T-like supernovae are closely related in essentially all of their UV, optical, and near-infrared properties -- as well as their host galaxy parameters -- to the slow-declining subset of Branch core-normal supernovae and to the intermediate 1999aa-like events, forming a continuum of luminous SNe Ia. The overriding difference between these three subgroups appears to be the extent to which $^{56}$Ni mixes into the ejecta, producing the pre-maximum spectra dominated by Fe III absorption, the broader UV light curves, and the higher luminosities that characterize the 1991T-like events. Nevertheless, the association of 1991T-like SNe with the rare Type Ia CSM supernovae would seem to run counter to this hypothesis, in which case 1991T-like events may form a separate subclass of SNe Ia, possibly arising from single-degenerate progenitor systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming generation of telescopes, instruments, and surveys is poised to usher in an unprecedented "Big Data" era in the field of astronomy. Within this context, even seemingly modest tasks such as spectral line analyses could become increasingly challenging for astronomers. In this paper, we announce the release of ${\rm L{\small I}M{\small E}}$. This package is tailored for multidisciplinary observations with long-slit and integral field spectroscopy (IFS) support. ${\rm L{\small I}M{\small E}}$ functions encompass the reading of observational files, detecting lines, conditioned line fitting, and the plotting and storage of results. Most importantly, these measurements are structured to support the subsequent chemical and kinematic analyses. To reduce the coding effort required from users, we introduced a notation system for atomic transitions that is accessible to humans and machine-readable. Along with this system, we present an extensive database of line bands, spanning from the ultraviolet to the infrared wavelength range. Additionally, we propose a model designed to train machine learning algorithms in line detection. ${\rm L{\small I}M{\small E}}$ features a comprehensive online documentation, which details the command attributes and includes several tutorials. These tutorials range from measuring a single line to analyzing an entire IFS data cube. This library functions and measurements are showcased in an online virtual observatory. The data in this interactive website come from the JWST NIRSpec observations of the CEERs survey. In this regard, ${\rm L{\small I}M{\small E}}$ offers improvements related to the dissemination and accessibility of astronomical spectra.

          Self-Gravitational Dynamics Within the Inner Oort Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of the Inner Oort Cloud (IOC) - a vast halo of icy bodies residing far beyond Neptune's orbit - is an expected outcome of the solar system's primordial evolution within a stellar cluster. Recent models have shown that the process of early planetesimal capture within the trans-Neptunian region may have been sufficiently high for the cumulative mass of the Cloud to approach several Earth masses. In light of this, here we examine the dynamical evolution of the IOC, driven by its own self-gravity. We show that the collective gravitational potential of the IOC is adequately approximated by the Miyamoto-Nagai model, and use a semi-analytic framework to demonstrate that the resulting secular oscillations are akin to the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai resonance. We verify our results with direct $N$-body calculations, and examine the effects of IOC self-gravity on the long-term behavior of the solar system's minor bodies using a detailed simulation. Cumulatively, we find that while the modulation of perihelion distances and inclinations can occur within an observationally relevant range, the associated timescales vastly surpass the age of the sun, indicating that the influence of IOC self-gravity on the architecture of the solar system is negligible.

          Using Asteroseismology to Calibrate the Physical Parameters of Confirmed Exoplanets and Their Evolved Host Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismology offers a profound window into stellar interiors and has emerged as a pivotal technique in exoplanetary research. This study harnesses the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations to reveal, for the first time, the asteroseismic oscillations of four exoplanet-hosting stars. Through meticulous analysis, we extracted their asteroseismic signatures, enabling the precise determination of stellar masses, radii, luminosities, and surface gravities. These parameters exhibit markedly reduced uncertainties compared to those derived from spectroscopic methods. Crucially, the exoplanets orbiting these stars were initially identified via radial velocity measurements. The refinement of host stellar masses necessitates a corresponding adjustment in planetary characteristics. Employing asteroseismology, we recalibrated the exoplanets' minimum masses and semi-major axes - a novel approach in the field. For instance, the exoplanet HD 5608 b's minimum mass, denoted as Msini, was ascertained to be 1.421 +/- 0.091 M_J through the integration of asteroseismic and radial velocity data. Similarly, two planets within the 7 CMa system yielded Msini values of 1.940 +/- 0.064 MJ and 0.912 +/- 0.067 M_J, respectively. Two planets in HD 33844 system presented Msini figures of 1.726 +/- 0.145 M_J and 1.541 +/- 0.182 M_J, while the HIP 67851 system's planets registered Msini at 1.243 +/- 0.139 M_J and a notably higher 5.387 +/- 0.699 M_J. This investigation extends beyond mere parameter refinement; it underscores the synergy between asteroseismology and exoplanetology, yielding unprecedented precision in system metrics. Focusing on quartet of K-type giants in advanced evolutionary phases, our work positions these systems as invaluable astrophysical laboratories, offering insights into the potential trajectory of our own solar system's fate.

 - **Abstract**
 We search for gamma-ray emission from OJ287 in the energy range from 0.1-300 GeV during 2015-2023, in coincidence with an extensive observing campaign to monitor the optical flux variability and polarization, as discussed in arXiv:2311.02372. We present results for eight segments in the aforementioned period, with each segment corresponding to an observing season. We find non-zero gamma-ray emission for all the eight segments. The photon and energy flux observed during this period is $\sim 5.2 \times 10^{-8} \rm{ph~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$ and $2.75 \times 10^{-5} \rm{MeV~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$, respectively, while the SED can be fitted with a power law with a slope of $2.12 \pm 0.02$. The observed luminosity is between $10^{45}-10^{46}$ ergs/sec.

 Deep-sea archives that include intermediate-lived radioactive $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$ particles suggest the occurrence of several recent supernovae inside the present-day volume of the Local Bubble during the last $\sim 10$ Myr. The isotope $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$ is mainly produced in massive stars and ejected in supernova explosions, which should always result in a sizeable yield of $^{26}\mathrm{Al}$ from the same objects. $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$ and $^{26}\mathrm{Al}$ decay with lifetimes of 3.82 and 1.05 Myr, and emit $\gamma$-rays at 1332 and 1809 keV, respectively. These $\gamma$-rays have been measured as diffuse glow of the Milky Way, and would also be expected from inside the Local Bubble as foreground emission. Based on two scenarios, one employing a geometrical model and the other state-of-the-art hydrodynamics simulations, we estimate the expected fluxes of the 1332 and 1809 keV $\gamma$-ray lines, as well as the resulting 511 keV line from positron annihilation due to the $^{26}\mathrm{Al}$ $\beta^+$-decay. We find fluxes in the range of $10^{-6}$-$10^{-5}\,\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$ for all three lines with isotropic contributions of 10-50%. We show that these fluxes are within reach for the upcoming COSI-SMEX $\gamma$-ray telescope over its nominal satellite mission duration of 2 yr. Given the Local Bubble models considered, we conclude that in the case of 10-20 Myr-old superbubbles, the distributions of $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$ and $^{26}\mathrm{Al}$ are not co-spatial - an assumption usually made in $\gamma$-ray data analyses. In fact, this should be taken into account however when analysing individual nearby targets for their $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$ to $^{26}\mathrm{Al}$ flux ratio as this gauges the stellar evolution models and the age of the superbubbles. A flux ratio measured for the Local Bubble could further constrain models of $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$ deposition on Earth and its moon.

 - **Abstract**
 In the present work, we study a cosmological model composed of a viscous dark matter interacting with decaying vacuum energy in a spatially flat Universe. In the first part, we find the analytical solution of different cosmological parameters by assuming the physically viable forms of bulk viscosity and decaying vacuum density with the interaction term. The second part is dedicated to constrain the free parameters of the interacting viscous model with decaying vacuum energy by employing latest observational data of $Pantheon+$, Cosmic Chronometer and $f(z)\sigma_{8}(z)$. We find that the interacting model just deviate very slightly from well-known concordance $\Lambda$CDM model and can alleviate effectively the current $H_0$ tension between local measurement by R21 and global measurement by Planck 2018, and the excess in the mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_{8}$ essentially vanish in this context. We report the Hubble constants as $H_0=72.150^{+0.989}_{-0.779}$, and $ 72.202^{+0.796}_{-0.937}$ \;$km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$, deceleration parameters as $q_0=-0.533 \pm 0.024$, and $-0.531 \pm 0.024$, and equation of state parameters as $w_0=-0.689 \pm 0.016$, and $ -0.687 \pm 0.016$ for $\Lambda$CDM and interacting models, respectively. It is found that the interacting model is in good agreement with $\Lambda$CDM. Further, we discuss the amplitude of matter power spectrum $\sigma_8$ and its associated parameter $S_8$ using $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$ data. Finally, the information selection criterion and Bayesian inference are discussed to distinguish the interacting model with $\Lambda$CDM model.

 - **Abstract**
 A morphological and photometric analysis of the naked-eye long-period comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) before perihelion is presented in this study. The observation images taken by the Zwicky Transient Facility survey telescope from July 2022 to October 2022 show a gradually brightening dust coma and a tail with a clear structure. The morphology of the dust coma reveals nonsteady-state emission with an ejection velocity lower than 14 m s$^{-1}$ for particles larger than 100 um. According to the syndyne-synchrone analysis, dust particles larger than about 10 um contribute significantly to the observed tail. The model simulations of the 10 October 2022 image suggest that the radii of large particles lingering near the nucleus range from 0.1 mm to 1 mm. Assuming that the nucleus of comet E3 is a homogeneous sphere with an albedo of 0.1, the photometry analysis sets the lower and upper limits of the nucleus radius to be $0.81\pm0.07$ km and $2.79\pm0.01$ km, respectively. The dust production rates increased continuously from $241\pm3$ kg s$^{-1}$ in July to $476\pm9$ kg s$^{-1}$ in October. The dependence of the ejection velocity $v_{\perp}$ perpendicular to the orbital plane of comet E3 on the particle size $a$ can be simplified as $v_{\perp}\propto a^{-1/2}$, which indicates that the dust emission is likely driven by gas. The water-production rate is inferred as $\sim 368\pm72$ kg s$^{-1}$ in October 2022, which is sustained by an equilibrium-sublimating area of $8.2\times10^6$ m$^2$ at least. The comparative analysis of the characteristics of comet E3 with those of comets belonging to different types shows that the activity profile of long-period comet E3 surprisingly aligns more closely with those of short-period comets within a heliocentric distance range of about [1.7, 3.4] AU, where the images of comet E3 that we used in this study were taken.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse the monthly sunspot group (SG) data for Solar Cycles C8-C23 and calculate the average latitude of the drift path for the northern and southern hemisphere of the Sun. We find that exponential function fits slightly better than the second-order polynomial to the average drift of the SGs. The drift velocities are are 0.30 and 0.27 degrees/month (meridional speed about 1.41 and 1.27 m/s) in the beginning and 0.071 and 0.069 degrees/month (about 0.33 and 0.32 m/s) at the end of the average cycle for northern and southern hemisphere, respectively. We do also bi-linear fits (first-order polynomial fits in two fractions) because they tell us the crossing point were the drift velocity changes the most. This crossing point for the Cycles C8-C23 is at 50 months and 15.4 degrees of latitude in the northern hemisphere and 54 months and -14.4 degrees for the southern hemisphere. The drift velocities calculated from the slopes of the bi-linear fits are 0.233 and 0.216 degrees/month (about 1.10 and 1.02 m/s) before the crossing point and 0.118 and 0.101 degrees/month (about 0.55 and 0.47 m/s) after the crossing point. We find a slight dependence of the migration on the strength of the cycle such that the drift path of the stronger cycles follow slightly higher latitudes than those of the weaker cycles. The areas of the sunspot groups affect also slightly to the drift path such that large area SGs have path at somewhat lower latitudes in the ascending phase and higher latitudes in the descending phase of the cycle than the smaller area SGs.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the star formation occurring in the Planck Galactic cold clump PGCC 120.69+2.66. Near-infrared JHKs images and K-band spectroscopy obtained with NOTCam at the Nordic Optical Telescope complemented with archive data are used to study the stellar content. In addition, millimetre line CO and CS spectra were obtained with the Onsala 20 m telescope, and sub-millimetre continuum SCUBA archive data are used to characterise the host molecular cloud. We identify a molecular cloud core traced by CO and CS emission at a distance of 1.1 kpc. In the region studied, we identify 5 submm continuum cores. Embedded in and around these dense submm cores, we find 38 young stellar objects, classified as 9 Class I, 8 Class II, and 21 near-IR excess or variability sources, accompanied by bipolar nebulosities and signs of protostellar jets. Furthermore, a very bright and reddened source is found towards this molecular cloud core. Even though its location appears to suggest its association to the star formation region, its infrared spectral type is compatible with a red supergiant, hidden behind 36 mag of visual extinction.

 - **Abstract**
 We point out that the rotation angle $\beta$ of cosmic birefringence, which is a recently reported parity-violating signal in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), has a phase ambiguity of $n\pi \,(n\in\mathbb{Z})$. This ambiguity has a significant impact on the interpretation of the origin of cosmic birefringence. Assuming an axion-like particle as the origin of cosmic birefringence, this ambiguity can be partly broken by the anisotropic cosmic birefringence and the shape of the CMB angular power spectra. We also discuss constraints on $\beta$ from existing experimental results.

          ZTF J185259.31+124955.2: A new evolved disc-eclipsing binary system

 - **Abstract**
 Discs in long-period eclipsing binary systems are rare and can lead to extraordinary eclipsing events. ZTF J185259.31+124955.2 was identified as a candidate disc-eclipsing system through a continuing search programme of ZTF variables with a near-IR excess in the WISE data. Examination of the combined ZTF and ATLAS photometry shows seven eclipses since 2017 with depths of 0\fm34 in all bands on a period of $289.57\pm0.09$\,d. The eclipse width is $\sim 40$\,d but this and the profile evolve over time. Comparison with library spectra shows that the spectral energy distribution from the available photometry is consistent with an early K-type giant, and fitting black-body profiles suggests $T_{eff} \sim 4000$\,K for the stellar component, with a cool component having $T_{eff} < 500$\,K. The reddening and distance, and hence the luminosity place the star within the giant branch. The most likely scenario is that the system is in a state of rapid evolution following Case B/C mass transfer into an extended disc around an unseen companion.

          Planet-driven spirals in protoplanetary discs: limitations of the semi-analytical theory for observations

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting protoplanets during their formation stage is an important but elusive goal of modern astronomy. Kinematic detections via the spiral wakes in the gaseous disc are a promising avenue to achieve this goal. We aim to test the applicability to observations in the low and intermediate planet mass regimes of a commonly used semi-analytical model for planet induced spiral waves. In contrast with previous works which proposed to use the semi-analytical model to interpret observations, in this study we analyse for the first time both the structure of the velocity and density perturbations. We run a set of FARGO3D hydrodynamic simulations and compare them with the output of the semi-analytic model in the code wakeflow, which is obtained by solving Burgers' equation using the simulations as an initial condition. We find that the velocity field derived from the analytic theory is discontinuous at the interface between the linear and nonlinear regions. After 0.2 r$_p$ from the planet, the behaviour of the velocity field closely follows that of the density perturbations. In the low mass limit, the analytical model is in qualitative agreement with the simulations, although it underestimates the azimuthal width and the amplitude of the perturbations, predicting a stronger decay but a slower azimuthal advance of the shock fronts. In the intermediate regime, the discrepancy increases, resulting in a different pitch angle between the spirals of the simulations and the analytic model. The implementation of a fitting procedure based on the minimisation of intensity residuals is bound to fail due to the deviation in pitch angle between the analytic model and the simulations. In order to apply this model to observations, it needs to be revisited accounting also for higher planet masses.

 - **Abstract**
 A direct consequence of Faraday rotation is that the polarized radio sky does not resemble the total intensity sky at long wavelengths. We analyze G137+7, which is undetectable in total intensity but appears as a depolarization feature. We use the first polarization maps from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment. Our $400-729$ MHz bandwidth and angular resolution, $17'$ to $30'$, allow us to use Faraday synthesis to analyze the polarization structure. In polarized intensity and polarization angle maps, we find a "tail" extending $10^\circ$ from the "head" and designate the combined object the "tadpole". Similar polarization angles, distinct from the background, indicate that the head and tail are physically associated. The head appears as a depolarized ring in single channels, but wideband observations show that it is a Faraday rotation feature. Our investigations of H I and H$\alpha$ find no connections to the tadpole. The tail suggests motion of either the gas or an ionizing star through the ISM; the B2(e) star HD 20336 is a candidate. While the head features a coherent, $\sim -8$ rad m$^2$ Faraday depth, Faraday synthesis also identifies multiple components in both the head and tail. We verify the locations of the components in the spectra using QU fitting. Our results show that $\sim$octave-bandwidth Faraday rotation observations at $\sim 600$ MHz are sensitive to low-density ionized or partially-ionized gas which is undetectable in other tracers.

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are abundant in globular clusters (GCs), which offer favorable environments for their creation. While the advent of recent, powerful facilities led to a rapid increase in MSP discoveries in GCs through pulsation searches, detection biases persist. In this work, we investigate the ability of current and future detections in GCs to constrain the parameters of the MSP population in GCs through a careful study of their luminosity function. Parameters of interest are the number of MSPs hosted by a GC, as well as the mean and the width of their luminosity function, which are typically affected by large uncertainties. While, as we show, likelihood-based studies can lead to ill-behaved posterior on the size of the MSP population, we introduce a novel, likelihood-free analysis, based on Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation, which consistently produces well-behaved posteriors. We focus on the GC Terzan 5, which currently counts 48 detected MSPs. We find that about 158 MSPs should be hosted in this GC, but the uncertainty on this number remains large. We explore the performance of our new method on simulated Terzan 5-like datasets mimicking possible future observational outcomes. We find that significant improvement on the posteriors can be obtained by adding a reliable measurement of the diffuse radio emission of the GC to the analysis or by improving the detection threshold of current radio pulsation surveys by at least a factor two.

 - **Abstract**
 We obtain the largest catalog of multi-mode $\delta$ Sct stars in the northern sky to date using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Data Release 20 (DR20). The catalog includes 2254 objects, of which 2181 are new to our study. Among these multi-mode $\delta$ Sct stars, 2142 objects are double-mode $\delta$ Sct, while 109 objects are triple-mode $\delta$ Sct and 3 are quadruple-mode $\delta$ Sct. By analyzing the light curves in the $r$ and $g$ bands of the ZTF, we determine the basic parameters of multi-mode $\delta$ Sct stars, including the periods and amplitudes. Periods are checked by comparison with the OGLE catalog of double-mode $\delta$ Sct stars. On the Petersen diagram, multi-mode $\delta$ Sct stars form six sequences. We find that in Galactic coordinates, the periods of 1O/F double-mode $\delta$ Sct stars at high latitudes are shorter than those of 1O/F double-mode $\delta$ Sct stars in the disk, due to metallicity variations. In the future, our catalog can be used to establish the period--luminosity relation and the period--metallicity relation of double-mode $\delta$ Sct stars, and to study the Galactic structure.
