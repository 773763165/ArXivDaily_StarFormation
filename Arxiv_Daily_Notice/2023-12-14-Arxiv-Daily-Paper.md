#### Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints on $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ gravity

 - **Abstract**
 Big Bang Nucleosynthesis provides us with an observational insight into the very early Universe. Since this mechanism of light element synthesis comes out of the standard model of particle cosmology which follows directly from General Relativity, it is expected that any modifications to GR will result in deviations in the predicted observable parameters which are mainly, the neutron-to-proton ratio and the baryon-to-photon ratio. We use the measured neutron-to-proton ratio and compare the theoretically obtained expressions to constrain two models in the framework of $ f(T,\mathcal{T}) $ gravity. The theoretically constrained models are then tested against observational data from the Hubble dataset and the $ \Lambda $CDM model to explain the accelerated expansion of the Universe.
#### Probing Cosmological Principle using the spectral index of quasar flux  distribution

 - **Abstract**
 We study the dipole signal in the spectral index (x) of the differential number counts using quasars in the CatWISE2020 catalog of infrared sources. The index is extracted by using the log-likelihood method. We obtain the value $x=1.579 \pm 0.001$ for a quasar sample of 1355352 sources. We extract the dipole signal in this parameter by employing $\chi^{2}$ minimization, assuming a sky model of x up to the quadrupole term. We find that the dipole amplitude |D| is 0.005 \pm 0.002 and dipole direction (l, b) in Galactic coordinate system equal to $(201.50^{\circ} \pm 27.87^{\circ}, -29.37^{\circ} \pm 19.86^{\circ})$. The direction of dipole anisotropy is found to be very close to the hemispherical power asymmetry $(l,b)=(221^\circ,-27^{\circ})$ in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We also obtain a signal of quadrupole anisotropy which is correlated with the ecliptic poles and can be attributed to ecliptic bias.}

 - **Abstract**
 There is probably not a black hole in the center of the sun. Despite this detail, our goal in this work to convince the reader that this question is interesting and that work studying stars with central black holes is well motivated. If primordial black holes exist then they may exist in sufficiently large numbers to explain the dark matter in the universe. While primordial black holes may form at almost any mass, the asteroid-mass window between $10^{-16} - 10^{-10} ~ \textrm{M}_\odot$ remains a viable dark matter candidate and these black holes could be captured by stars upon formation. Such a star, partially powered by accretion luminosity from a microscopic black hole in its core, has been called a `Hawking star.' Stellar evolution of Hawking stars is highly nontrivial and requires detailed stellar evolution models, which were developed in our recent work. We present here full evolutionary models of solar mass Hawking stars using two accretion schemes: one with a constant radiative efficiency, and one that is new in this work that uses an adaptive radiative efficiency to model the effects of photon trapping.
#### Outcomes of Sub-Neptune Collisions

 - **Abstract**
 Observed high multiplicity planetary systems are often tightly packed. Numerical studies indicate that such systems are susceptible to dynamical instabilities. Dynamical instabilities in close-in tightly packed systems, similar to those found in abundance by Kepler, often lead to planet-planet collisions. For sub-Neptunes, the dominant type of observed exoplanets, the planetary mass is concentrated in a rocky core, but the volume is dominated by a low-density gaseous envelope. For these, using the traditional `sticky-sphere' assumption is questionable. Using both N-body integration and smoothed-particle hydrodynamics, we have simulated sub-Neptune collisions for a wide range in realistic kinematic properties such as impact parameters ($b^{\prime}$) and impact velocities ($v_{\rm{im}}$) to study the possible outcomes in detail. We find that the majority ($\sim 76\%$) of the collisions with kinematic properties similar to what is expected from dynamical instabilities in multiplanet systems may not lead to mergers of sub-Neptunes. Instead, the sub-Neptunes separate from each other, often with significant atmosphere loss. When mergers do occur, they can involve significant mass loss even from the core and can sometimes lead to complete disruption of one or both planets. Sub-Neptunes merge or disrupt if $b^{\prime}<b_{\rm{c}}$, a critical value dependent on $ v_{\rm{im}}/v_{\rm{esc}}$, where $v_{\rm{esc}}$ is the escape velocity from the surface of the hypothetical merged planet assuming sticky-sphere. For $ v_{\rm{im}}/v_{\rm{esc}}\lesssim2.5$, $b_{\rm{c}}\propto (v_{\rm{im}}/v_{\rm{esc}})^{-2}$, and collisions with $b^{\prime}<b_{\rm{c}}$ typically leads to mergers. On the other hand, for $ v_{\rm{im}}/v_{\rm{esc}}\gtrsim2.5$, $b_{\rm{c}}\propto v_{\rm{im}}/v_{\rm{esc}}$, and the collisions with $b^{\prime}<b_{\rm{c}}$ can result in complete destruction of one or both sub-Neptunes.

 - **Abstract**
 The flavor composition of TeV--PeV astrophysical neutrinos, i.e., the proportion of neutrinos of different flavors in their flux, is a versatile probe of high-energy astrophysics and fundamental physics. Because flavor identification is challenging and the number of detected high-energy astrophysical neutrinos is limited, so far measurements of the flavor composition have represented an average over the range of observed neutrino energies. Yet, this washes out the potential existence of changes in the flavor composition with energy and weakens our sensitivity to the many models that posit them. For the first time, we measure the energy dependence of the flavor composition, looking for a transition from low to high energies. Our present-day measurements, based on the 7.5-year public sample of IceCube High-Energy Starting Events (HESE), find no evidence of a flavor transition. The observation of HESE and through-going muons jointly by next-generation neutrino telescopes Baikal-GVD, IceCube-Gen2, KM3NeT, P-ONE, TAMBO, and TRIDENT may identify a flavor transition around 200TeV by 2030. By 2040, we could infer the flavor composition with which neutrinos are produced with enough precision to establish the transition from neutrino production via the full pion decay chain at low energies to muon-damped pion decay at high energies.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive (>~ 8 solar masses) stars are the progenitors of many astrophysical systems, yet key aspects of their structure and evolution are poorly understood. Asteroseismology has the potential to solve these open puzzles, however, sampling both the short period pulsations and long period beat patterns of massive stars poses many observational challenges. Ground-based single-site observations require years or decades to discern the main oscillation modes. Multi-site campaigns were able to shorten this time span, but have not been able to scale up to population studies on samples of objects. Space-based observations can achieve both continuous sampling and observe large numbers of objects, however, most lack the multi-band data that is often necessary for mode identification and removing model degeneracies. Here, we develop and test a new ground-based observational strategy for discerning and identifying the main oscillation modes of a massive star in a few months, in a way that can be scaled to large samples. We do so using the Las Cumbres Observatory - a unique facility consisting of robotic, homogeneous telescopes operating as a global network, overcoming most of the challenges of previous multi-site efforts, but presenting new challenges which we tailor our strategy to address. This work serves as the proof of concept for the Global Asteroseismology Project, which aims to move massive star asteroseismology from single-objects to bulk studies, unleashing its full potential in constraining stellar structure and evolution models. This work also demonstrates the ability of the Las Cumbres Observatory to perform multi-site continuous observations for various science goals.
#### Orbital Torus Imaging: Acceleration, density, and dark matter in the  Galactic disk measured with element abundance gradients

 - **Abstract**
 Under the assumption of a simple and time-invariant gravitational potential, many Galactic dynamics techniques infer the Milky Way's mass and dark matter distribution from stellar kinematic observations. These methods typically rely on parameterized potential models of the Galaxy and must take into account non-trivial survey selection effects, because they make use of the density of stars in phase space. Large-scale spectroscopic surveys now supply information beyond kinematics in the form of precise stellar label measurements (especially element abundances). These element abundances are known to correlate with orbital actions or other dynamical invariants. Here, we use the Orbital Torus Imaging (OTI) framework that uses abundance gradients in phase space to map orbits. In many cases these gradients can be measured without detailed knowledge of the selection function. We use stellar surface abundances from the APOGEE survey combined with kinematic data from the Gaia mission. Our method reveals the vertical ($z$-direction) orbit structure in the Galaxy and enables empirical measurements of the vertical acceleration field and orbital frequencies in the disk. From these measurements, we infer the total surface mass density, $\Sigma$, and midplane volume density, $\rho_0$, as a function of Galactocentric radius and height. Around the Sun, we find $\Sigma_{\odot}(z=1.1$ kpc)$=72^{+6}_{-9}$M$_{\odot}$pc$^{-2}$ and $\rho_{\odot}(z=0)=0.081^{+0.015}_{-0.009}$ M$_{\odot}$pc$^{-3}$ using the most constraining abundance ratio, [Mg/Fe]. This corresponds to a dark matter contribution in surface density of $\Sigma_{\odot,\mathrm{DM}}(z=1.1$ kpc)$=24\pm4$ M$_{\odot}$pc$^{-2}$, and in total volume mass density of $\rho_{\odot,\mathrm{DM}}(z=0)=0.011\pm0.002$ M$_{\odot}$pc$^{-3}$. Moreover, using these mass density values we estimate the scale length of the low-$\alpha$ disc to be $h_R=2.24\pm0.06$kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 The structure and dynamics of the star-forming disk of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) have long confounded us. The SMC is widely used as a prototype for galactic physics at low metallicity, and yet we fundamentally lack an understanding of the structure of its interstellar medium (ISM). In this work, we present a new model for the SMC by comparing the kinematics of young, massive stars with the structure of the ISM traced by high-resolution observations of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) from the Galactic Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder survey (GASKAP-HI). Specifically, we identify thousands of young, massive stars with precise radial velocity constraints from the Gaia and APOGEE surveys and match these stars to the ISM structures in which they likely formed. By comparing the average dust extinction towards these stars, we find evidence that the SMC is composed of two structures with distinct stellar and gaseous chemical compositions. We construct a simple model that successfully reproduces the observations and shows that the ISM of the SMC is arranged into two, superimposed, star-forming systems with similar gas mass separated by ~5 kpc along the line of sight.
#### Characterization of the Repeating FRB 20220912A with the Allen Telescope  Array

 - **Abstract**
 FRB 20220912A is a repeating Fast Radio Burst (FRB) that was discovered in Fall 2022 and remained highly active for several months. We report the detection of 35 FRBs from 541 hours of follow-up observations of this source using the recently refurbished Allen Telescope Array, covering 1344 MHz of bandwidth primarily centered at 1572 MHz. All 35 FRBs were detected in the lower half of the band with non-detections in the upper half and covered fluences from 4-431 Jy-ms (median$=$48.27 Jy-ms). We find consistency with previous repeater studies for a range of spectrotemporal features including: bursts with downward frequency drifting over time; a positive correlation between bandwidth and center frequency; and a decrease in sub-burst duration over time. We report an apparent decrease in the center frequency of observed bursts over the 2 months of the observing campaign (corresponding to a drop of $6.21\pm 0.76$ MHz per day). We predict a cut-off fluence for FRB 20220912A of $F_\textrm{max}\lesssim 10^4$ Jy-ms, for this source to be consistent with the all-sky rate, and find that FRB 20220912A significantly contributed to the all-sky FRB rate at a level of a few percent for fluences of $\sim$100 Jy-ms. Finally, we investigate characteristic timescales and sub-burst periodicities and find a) a median inter-subburst timescale of 5.82$\pm$1.16 ms in the multi-component bursts and b) no evidence of strict periodicity even in the most evenly-spaced multi-component burst in the sample. Our results demonstrate the importance of wideband observations of FRBs, and provide an important set of observational parameters against which to compare FRB progenitor and emission mechanism models.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on IFU measurements of the host of the radio source 4C+37.11. This massive elliptical contains the only resolved double compact nucleus at pc-scale separation, likely a bound supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB). $i$-band photometry and GMOS-N IFU spectroscopy show that the galaxy has a large $r_b=1.5^{\prime\prime}$ core and that the stellar velocity dispersion increases inside of a radius of influence $r_{\rm SOI} \approx 1.3^{\prime\prime}$. Jeans Anisotropic Modeling analysis of the core infers a total SMBHB mass of $2.8^{+0.8}_{-0.8} \times 10^{10}M_\odot$, making this one of the most massive black hole systems known. Our data indicate that there has been significant scouring of the central kpc of the host galaxy.
#### IPA. Class 0 Protostars Viewed in CO Emission Using JWST/NIRSpec

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the bright CO fundamental emission in the central regions of five Class 0 protostars using the JWST's Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and provide clues to what processes excite the gas. CO line emission images are extracted for a forest of $\sim$150 ro-vibrational transitions from two vibrational bands, $v=1-0$ and $v=2-1$. However, ${}^{13}$CO is not detected, and thus we can only statistically constrain the ${}^{12}$CO optical depth. Using noise measurements to determine upper limits to the ${}^{13}$CO emission, the flux ratio of ${}^{12}$CO/${}^{13}$CO indicates that the ${}^{12}$CO emission itself is not optically thick for ro-vibrational transitions with upper state rotational quantum number $J_u \geq 15$. We construct population diagrams to estimate the rotational temperature and number of molecules from extinction-corrected CO line fluxes assuming CO emission is optically thin. Two different temperature components are required for $v=1$ ($\sim600-1000$ K and $\sim1500-3500$ K), while one hotter component is required for $v=2$ ($\sim2000-6000$ K). The vibrational temperature is $\sim 900$ K among our sources and shows no trend with luminosity. Using vibrational temperatures and the inferred total amount of CO molecules for our sources, the total warm gas mass correlates strongly with luminosity ranging from $\sim$0.1 $\rm M_{Earth}$ for the low-mass protostars to $\sim$1 M$_{\rm sun}$ for the high-mass protostars. Interpreting the distribution of gas column densities and temperatures depends on radiative and chemical processes affecting CO. The presence of a $v=2$ population may indicate CO gas radiatively excited. Selective UV photodissociation of CO isotopologues around our high-mass sources may explain their depletion of ${}^{13}$CO.
#### The Breakthrough Listen Search for Intelligent Life: Detection and  Characterization of Anomalous Transits in Kepler Lightcurves

 - **Abstract**
 Never before has the detection and characterization of exoplanets via transit photometry been as promising and feasible as it is now, due to the increasing breadth and sensitivity of time domain optical surveys. Past works have made use of phase-folded stellar lightcurves in order to study the properties of exoplanet transits, because this provides the highest signal that a transit is present at a given period and ephemeris. Characterizing transits on an individual, rather than phase-folded, basis is much more challenging due to the often low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of lightcurves, missing data, and low sampling rates. However, by phase-folding a lightcurve we implicitly assume that all transits have the same expected properties, and lose all information about the nature and variability of the transits. We miss the natural variability in transit shapes, or even the deliberate or inadvertent modification of transit signals by an extraterrestrial civilization (for example, via laser emission or orbiting megastructures). In this work, we develop an algorithm to search stellar lightcurves for individual anomalous (in timing or depth) transits, and we report the results of that search for 218 confirmed transiting exoplanet systems from Kepler.
#### 2-mm-Thick Large-Area CdTe Double-sided Strip Detectors for  High-Resolution Spectroscopic Imaging of X-ray and Gamma-ray with  Depth-Of-Interaction Sensing

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.07915
 - **Abstract**
 We developed a 2-mm-thick CdTe double-sided strip detector (CdTe-DSD) with a 250 um strip pitch, which has high spatial resolution with a uniform large imaging area of 10 cm$^2$ and high energy resolution with high detection efficiency in tens to hundreds keV. The detector can be employed in a wide variety of fields for quantitative observations of hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray with spectroscopic imaging, for example, space observation, nuclear medicine, and non-destructive elemental analysis. This detector is thicker than the 0.75-mm-thick one previously developed by a factor of $\sim$2.7, thus providing better detection efficiency for hard X-rays and soft gamma rays. The increased thickness could potentially enhance bias-induced polarization if we do not apply sufficient bias and if we do not operate at a low temperature, but the polarization is not evident in our detector when a high voltage of 500 V is applied to the CdTe diode and the temperature is maintained at 20 $^\circ$C during one-day experiments. The ''Depth Of Interaction'' (DOI) dependence due to the CdTe diode's poor carrier-transport property is also more significant, resulting in much DOI information while complicated detector responses such as charge sharings or low-energy tails that exacerbate the loss in the energy resolution. In this paper, we developed 2-mm-thick CdTe-DSDs, studied their response, and evaluated their energy resolution, spatial resolution, and uniformity. We also constructed a theoretical model to understand the detector response theoretically, resulting in reconstructing the DOI with an accuracy of 100 um while estimating the carrier-transport property. We realized the detector that has high energy resolution and high 3D spatial resolution with a uniform large imaging area.
#### Theoretical period-radius and period-luminosity relations for Mira  variables with solar metallicity

 - **Abstract**
 Evolutionary sequences of AGB stars with initial masses on the main sequence $M_\mathrm{ZAMS}=1.5M_\odot$, $2M_\odot$ and $3M_\odot$ were computed for the initial metallicity $Z=0.014$. Selected models of evolutionary sequences with envelopes under thermal equilibrium were used as initial conditions for calculation of nonlinear stellar pulsations. The hydrodynamic models of each evolutionary sequence are shown to concentrate along the continuous line in the period-radius and period-luminosity diagrams. The theoretical period-radius and period-luminosity relations differ from one another for different main-sequence star masses because the stellar luminosity of AGB stars depends on the degenerate carbon core mass which increases with increasing $M_\mathrm{ZAMS}$. In hydrodynamic models of evolutionary sequences $M_\mathrm{ZAMS}=2M_\odot$ and $M_\mathrm{ZAMS}=3M_\odot$ the periods of the first overtone pulsators are $86~\textrm{d}\le\Pi\le 123~\textrm{d}$ and $174~\textrm{d}\le\Pi\le 204~\textrm{d}$, whereas all models of the evolutionary sequence $M_\mathrm{ZAMS}=1.5M_\odot$ oscillate in the fundamental mode. Fairly regular radial oscillations exist in stars with pulsation periods $\Pi\lesssim 500$ d. In models with longer periods the amplitude rapidly increases with increasing $\Pi$ and oscillations become irregular.

 - **Abstract**
 Intensity interferometry for astrophysical observations has gained increasing interest in the last decade. The method of correlating photon fluxes at different telescopes for high resolution astronomy without access to the phase of the incoming light is insensitive to atmospheric turbulence and doesn't require high-precision optical path control. The necessary large collection areas can be provided by Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes. Implementation of intensity interferometers to existing telescope systems such as VERITAS and MAGIC has proven to be successful for high-resolution imaging of stars. In April 2022 we equipped two telescopes of the H.E.S.S. array in Namibia with an intensity interferometry setup to measure southern sky stars and star systems during the bright moon period. We mounted an external optical system to the lid of the telescope cameras, which splits the incoming light and feeds it into two photomultipliers in order to measure the zero-baseline correlation within one telescope in addition to the cross correlation between the telescopes. The optical elements are motorised, which enables live correction of tracking inaccuracies of the telescopes. During the campaign we measured the spatial correlation curves and thereby the angular diameters of {\lambda} Sco (Shaula) and {\sigma} Sgr (Nunki), while we also performed systematic studies of our interferometer using the multiple star system of {\alpha} Cru (Acrux).
#### Unveiling the origin of the optical/UV emission from the Galactic ULX  Swift J0243.6+6124 during its 2017-2018 giant outburst

 - **Abstract**
 From late September 2017 to February 2018, the Be X-ray binary (BeXB) Swift J0243.6+6124 underwent an unprecedently bright giant outburst. The reported X-ray luminosities were so high that the system was classified as an Ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX). It was also the first BeXB pulsar showing radio jet emission. The source was not only bright in X-rays and radio, but also in optical and UV wavelenghts. In this paper we aim to understand the origin of the observed optical/UV fluxes simultaneous to the X-ray emission. We studied the optical/UV light curves in comparison with the X-ray fluxes along the outburst, considering the main mechanisms that can explain the optical/UV emission in X-ray binaries. Due to the tight correlation observed between the optical/UV and X-ray light curves, reprocessing of X-rays seems to be the most plausible explanation. We calculated the timescales of the light curves decays and studied the correlation indexes between the optical and X-ray emission. Finally, we built a physical model considering X-ray heating of the surface of the donor star, irradiation of the accretion disk, and emission from a viscously heated accretion disk, in order to reproduce the observed optical/UV SEDs along the outburst. We considered in our model that the Be circumstellar disk was co-planar to the orbit, and then we neglected its irradiation in the current model. As an input of the model, we used as incident X-ray luminosities those calculated from the bolometric X-ray fluxes obtained from the spectral fit of the Swift/XRT and BAT observations. We conclude that reprocessing of X-rays as X-ray heating of the Be star surface and irradiation of the accretion disk are the two main mechanisms that can reproduce the observed optical/UV emission during the 2017-2018 giant outburst of Swift J0243.6+6124.

 - **Abstract**
 The most energetic astrophysical sources in the Milky Way, cosmic accelerators capable of producing high-energy cosmic rays, have resisted discovery for over a century. Up to now, astrophysicists sought these sources mainly by scouring the Galaxy for the gamma rays they are expected to emit. In 2023, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory discovered high-energy neutrinos from the Milky Way, inaugurating a telltale stream of evidence of cosmic-ray production and interaction in the Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The hotspot emission of accreting millisecond pulsars (AMPs) undergoes scattering in the accretion flow between the disk inner radius and the neutron star surface. The scattering optical depth of the flow depends on the photon emission angle, which is a function of the pulse phase, and reaches its maximum when the hotspot is closest to the observer. At sufficiently large optical depths the observed pulse profile should develop a secondary minimum, the depth of which depends on the accretion rate and the emission geometry. Such a dip evolving with the accretion rate might explain the phase shift and pulse profile evolution observed in AMPs during outbursts. Accounting for scattering is important for accurate modeling of the AMP pulse profiles in order to improve the accuracy of determination of the neutron star parameters, such as their masses and radii. In this paper we present a simplified analytical model for the Thomson optical depth of the accretion funnel, and apply it to simulating the pulse profiles. We show that scattering in the accretion funnel has a significant effect on the pulse profiles at accretion rates of $\dot{M} \gtrsim 10^{-10}~{M}_\odot\, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Our model predicts a gradual evolution of the pulse profile with the accretion rate that appears to be consistent with the observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The Earth's mesopause region between about 75 and 105 km is characterised by chemiluminescent emission from various lines of different molecules and atoms. This emission was and is important for the study of the chemistry and dynamics in this altitude region at nighttime. However, our understanding of molecular emissions with low intensities and high line densities is still very limited. Based on 10 years of data from the astronomical X-shooter echelle spectrograph at Cerro Paranal in Chile, we have characterised in detail this nightglow (pseudo-)continuum in the wavelength range from 300 to 1,800 nm. We studied the spectral features, derived continuum components with similar variability, calculated climatologies, studied the response to solar activity, and even estimated the effective emission heights. The results indicate that the nightglow continuum at Cerro Paranal essentially consists of only two components, which exhibit very different properties. The main structures of these components peak at 595 and 1,510 nm. While the former was previously identified as the main peak of the FeO 'orange arc' bands, the latter is a new discovery. Laboratory data and theory indicate that this feature and other structures between about 800 and at least 1,800 nm are caused by emission from HO$_2$. We performed runs with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) with modified chemistry and found that the total intensity, layer profile, and variability indeed support this interpretation, where the excited HO$_2$ radicals are mostly produced from the termolecular recombination of H and O$_2$. The WACCM results for the continuum at visual wavelengths show good agreement for FeO from the reaction of Fe and O$_3$. However, the simulated total emission appears to be too low, which would require additional mechanisms where the variability is dominated by O$_3$.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsars are known for their exceptionally stable rotation. However, this stability can be disrupted by glitches, sudden increases in rotation frequency whose cause is poorly understood. In this study, we present some preliminary results from the pulsar monitoring campaign conducted at the IAR since 2019. We present measurements from timing solution fits of the parameters of five glitches: one glitch in the Vela pulsar, one in PSR J0742-2822, one in PSR J1740-3015, and two mini-glitches in PSR J1048-5832. Finally, we applied the vortex creep model to characterize the inter-glitch period of Vela. However, the preliminary results yielded highly degenerate and loosely constrained parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite a rich observational background, few spectroscopic studies have dealt with the measurement of the carbon isotopic ratio in giant stars. However, it is a key element in understanding the mixing mechanisms that occur in the interiors of giant stars. We present the CNO and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C abundances derived for 71 giant field stars. Then, using this new catalogue and complementary data from the Kepler and Gaia satellites, we study the efficiency of mixing occurring in the giant branch as a function of the stellar properties. We have determined the abundances of CNO and more specifically 12C/13C using the FIES Spectrograph on the Nordic Optical Telescope, for 71 giant field stars. In addition, asteroseismology is available for all stars, providing their mass, age as well as the evolutionary states. Finally, astrometry from Gaia data is also available for the majority of the sample. We compare these new determinations with stellar evolution models taking into account the effects of transport processes. To exploit the complete potential of our extensive catalogue and considering both the Galactic evolution and the impact of stellar evolution, we built mock catalogues using the Besancon Galaxy model in which stellar evolution models taking into account the effects of thermohaline instability are included. We confirm that 12C/13C at the surface of core He-burning stars is lower than that of first ascent RGB stars. 12C/13C measured at the surface of the core He-burning stars increases with [Fe/H] and mass while it decreases with age. These trends are all very well explained by the thermohaline mixing that occurs in red giants. We have shown that our models can explain the behaviour of 12C/13C versus N/O, although the observations seem to show a lower N/O than the models. We also note that more constraints on the thick disc core He-burning stars are needed to understand this difference.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing is proven to be one of the most efficient tools for studying the Universe. The spectral confirmation of such sources requires extensive calibration. This paper discusses the spectral extraction technique for the case of multiple source spectra being very near each other. Using the masking technique, we first detect high Signal-to-Noise (S/N) peaks in the CCD spectral image corresponding to the location of the source spectra. This technique computes the cumulative signal using a weighted sum, yielding a reliable approximation for the total counts contributed by each source spectrum. We then proceed with the subtraction of the contaminating spectra. Applying this method, we confirm the nature of 11 lensed quasar candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 The eROSITA X-ray telescope on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) spacecraft observed the field of the UKIDSS Ultra-Deep Survey (UDS) in August-September 2019, during its flight to Sun-Earth L2 point. The resulting eROSITA UDS (or eUDS) survey was thus the first eROSITA X-ray imaging survey, which demonstrated the capability of the telescope to perform uniform observations of large sky areas. With a moderate single-camera exposure of 150 ks, eUDS covered ~5 deg^2 with the limiting flux ranging between 4E-15 and 5E-14 erg/s/cm^2, in the 0.3-2.3 keV band. We present a catalogue of 647 sources detected at likelihood >10 (~4 sigma) during the eUDS. The catalogue provides information on the source fluxes in the main energy band 0.3-2.3 keV and forced photometry in a number of bands between 0.3 and 8 keV. Using the deeper 4XMM-DR12 catalogue, we have identified 22 strongly variable objects that have brightened or faded by at least a factor of ten during the eROSITA observations compared to previous observations by XMM-Newton. We also provide a catalogue of 22 sources detected by eROSITA in the hard energy band of 2.3-5 keV.

 - **Abstract**
 If dark matter is made of QCD axions, its abundance is determined by the vacuum expectation value acquired by the axion field during inflation. The axion is usually assumed to follow the equilibrium distribution arising from quantum diffusion during inflation. This leads to the so-called stochastic window under which the QCD axion can make up all the dark matter. It is characterised by $10^{10.4}\mathrm{GeV}\leq f\leq 10^{17.2}\mathrm{GeV}$ and $H_{\mathrm{end}}>10^{-2.2}\mathrm{GeV}$, where $f$ is the axion decay constant and $H_{\mathrm{end}}$ is the Hubble expansion rate at the end of inflation. However, in realistic inflationary potentials, we show that the axion never reaches the equilibrium distribution at the end of inflation. This is because the relaxation time of the axion is much larger than the typical time scale over which $H$ varies during inflation. As a consequence, the axion acquires a quasi-flat distribution as long as it remains light during inflation. This leads us to reassessing the stochastic axion window, and we find that $ 10^{10.3}\mathrm{GeV}\leq f\leq 10^{14.1}\mathrm{GeV}$ and $H_{\mathrm{end}}>10^{-13.8}\mathrm{GeV}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Rapid rotation and nonradial pulsations enable Be stars to build decretion disks, where the characteristic line emission forms. A major but unconstrained fraction of Be stars owe their rapid rotation to mass and angular-momentum transfer in a binary. The faint, stripped companions can be helium-burning subdwarf OB-type stars (sdOBs), white dwarfs (WDs), or neutron stars. We present optical/near-IR CHARA interferometry of 37 Be stars selected for spectroscopic indications of low-mass companions. From multi-epoch $H$- and/or $K$-band interferometry plus radial velocities and parallaxes collected elsewhere, we constructed 3D orbits and derived flux ratios and absolute dynamical masses of both components for six objects, quadrupling the number of anchor points for evolutionary models. In addition, a new wider companion was identified for the known Be + sdO binary 59 Cyg, while auxiliary VLTI/GRAVITY spectrointerferometry confirmed circumstellar matter around the sdO companion to HR 2142. On the other hand, we failed to detect any companion to the six Be stars with $\gamma$ Cas-like X-ray emission, with sdOB and main-sequence companions of the expected spectroscopic mass being ruled out for the X-ray-prototypical stars $\gamma$ Cas and $\pi$ Aqr, leaving the elusive WD companions as the most likely companions, as well as a likely explanation of the X-rays. No low-mass main-sequence close companions were identified in the other stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a cosmological model wherein a waterfall symmetry breaking occurs during the radiation-dominated era. The model comprises a complex waterfall field, an axion field, and the gauge field (dark photon) generated through a tachyonic instability due to the Chern-Simons interaction. Prior to symmetry breaking, the total energy density incorporates a vacuum energy from the waterfall field, establishing a novel scenario for Early Dark Energy (EDE). Subsequent to the symmetry breaking, the dark photon dynamically acquires mass via the Higgs mechanism, potentially contributing to the dark matter abundance. Hence, our model can simultaneously address the $H_0$ tension and the origin of dark matter.

 The High-Resolution Multi-Object Spectrograph (HRMOS) is a facility instrument that we plan to propose for the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), following the initial presentation at the VLT 2030 workshop held at ESO in June 2019. HRMOS provides a combination of capabilities that are essential to carry out breakthrough science across a broad range of active research areas from stellar astrophysics and exoplanet studies to Galactic and Local Group archaeology. HRMOS fills a gap in capabilities amongst the landscape of future instrumentation planned for the next decade. The key characteristics of HRMOS will be high spectral resolution (R = 60000 - 80000) combined with multi-object (20-100) capabilities and long term stability that will provide excellent radial velocity precision and accuracy (10m/s). Initial designs predict that a SNR~100 will be achievable in about one hour for a star with mag(AB) = 15, while with the same exposure time a SNR~ 30 will be reached for a star with mag(AB) = 17. The combination of high resolution and multiplexing with wavelength coverage extending to relatively blue wavelengths (down to 380\,nm), makes HRMOS a spectrograph that will push the boundaries of our knowledge and that is envisioned as a workhorse instrument in the future. The science cases presented in this White Paper include topics and ideas developed by the Core Science Team with the contributions from the astronomical community, also through the wide participation in the first HRMOS Workshop (https://indico.ict.inaf.it/event/1547/) that took place in Firenze (Italy) in October 2021.

 - **Abstract**
 Young, low-mass Brown Dwarfs orbiting early-type stars, with low mass ratios ($q\lesssim0.01$), appear intrinsically rare and present a formation dilemma: could a handful of these objects be the highest mass outcomes of ``planetary" formation channels (bottom up within a protoplanetary disk), or are they more representative of the lowest mass ``failed binaries" (formed via disk fragmentation, or core fragmentation)? Additionally, their orbits can yield model-independent dynamical masses, and when paired with wide wavelength coverage and accurate system age estimates, can constrain evolutionary models in a regime where the models have a wide dispersion depending on initial conditions. We present new interferometric observations of the $16\,\mathrm{Myr}$ substellar companion HD~136164~Ab (HIP~75056~Ab) with VLTI/GRAVITY and an updated orbit fit including proper motion measurements from the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalogue of Accelerations. We estimate a dynamical mass of $35\pm10\,\mathrm{M_J}$ ($q\sim0.02$), making HD~136164~Ab the youngest substellar companion with a dynamical mass estimate. The new mass and newly constrained orbital eccentricity ($e=0.44\pm0.03$) and separation ($22.5\pm1\,\mathrm{au}$) could indicate that the companion formed via the low-mass tail of the Initial Mass Function. Our atmospheric fit to the \texttt{SPHINX} M-dwarf model grid suggests a sub-solar C/O ratio of $0.45$, and $3\times$ solar metallicity, which could indicate formation in the circumstellar disk via disk fragmentation. Either way, the revised mass estimate likely excludes ``bottom-up" formation via core accretion in the circumstellar disk. HD~136164~Ab joins a select group of young substellar objects with dynamical mass estimates; epoch astrometry from future \textit{Gaia} data releases will constrain the dynamical mass of this crucial object further.
#### An Argentinian window to the fast transient sky and to the very high  resolution observations

 - **Abstract**
 The transient sky is composed of diverse phenomena that exhibits dramatic changes on short timescales. These events range from sub-second bursts to weeks and month timescale variability from compact systems. Several challenges need to be addressed by any facility that aims to observe such events: a fast re-positioning scheme to trace the first moments of events like Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), a large field of view to be able to detect new Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), or high sensitivity and high cadence to detect the outflows and flaring activity in Galactic binaries. Combined with a large bandwidth in order to recover the spectral information from these sources, it would allow us to unveil the physical processes taking place in these systems. The new Multipurpose Interferometer Array (MIA) in Argentina may represent a suitable facility to conduct deep and leading-edge studies on the transient sky as the aforementioned ones. Additionally, there is a significant interest from the community on the possibility of connecting the 30-m IAR antennas within a VLBI network such as the European VLBI Network (EVN). This would place Argentina in the map to achieve very-high-resolution (on the milliarcsecond level) observations. This mode, together with the observations with the MIA would open a potential new regime that would allow astronomers to significantly increase the knowledge on the Southern Sky.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric retrievals (AR) characterize exoplanets by estimating atmospheric parameters from observed light spectra, typically by framing the task as a Bayesian inference problem. However, traditional approaches such as nested sampling are computationally expensive, thus sparking an interest in solutions based on machine learning (ML). In this ongoing work, we first explore flow matching posterior estimation (FMPE) as a new ML-based method for AR and find that, in our case, it is more accurate than neural posterior estimation (NPE), but less accurate than nested sampling. We then combine both FMPE and NPE with importance sampling, in which case both methods outperform nested sampling in terms of accuracy and simulation efficiency. Going forward, our analysis suggests that simulation-based inference with likelihood-based importance sampling provides a framework for accurate and efficient AR that may become a valuable tool not only for the analysis of observational data from existing telescopes, but also for the development of new missions and instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 The amount of Adaptive Optics (AO) telemetry generated by VIS/NIR ground-based observatories is ever greater, leading to a growing need for a standardised data exchange format to support performance analysis and AO research and development activities that involve large-scale telemetry mining, processing, and curation. This paper introduces the Adaptive Optics Telemetry (AOT) data exchange format as a standard for sharing AO telemetry from visible/infrared ground-based observatories. AOT is based on the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) and aims to provide unambiguous and consistent data access across various systems and configurations, including natural and single/multiple laser guide-star AO systems. We designed AOT focused on two key use cases: atmospheric turbulence parameter estimation and point-spread function reconstruction (PSF-R). We prototyped and tested the design using existing AO telemetry datasets from multiple systems: single conjugate with natural and laser guide stars, tomographic systems with multi-channel wavefront sensors, single and multi wavefront correctors in systems featuring either a Shack-Hartmann or Pyramid as main wavefront sensors. The AOT file structure has been thoroughly defined, specifying data fields, descriptions, data types, units, and expected dimensions. To support this format, we have developed a Python package that enables data conversion, reading, writing and exploration of AOT files, which has been made publicly available and compatible with a general-purpose Python package manager. We demonstrate the flexibility of the AOT format by packaging data from five different instruments, installed on different telescopes.
#### Large and complex X-ray time lags from black hole accretion disks with  compact inner coronae

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole X-ray binaries in their hard and hard-intermediate states display hard and soft time lags between broadband noise variations (high-energy emission lagging low-energy and vice versa), which could be used to constrain the geometry of the disk and Comptonising corona in these systems. Comptonisation and reverberation lag models, which are based on light-travel delays, can imply coronae which are very large (hundreds to thousands of gravitational radii, $R_{g}$) and in conflict with constraints from X-ray spectral modelling and polarimetry. Here we show that the observed large and complex X-ray time lags can be explained by a model where fluctuations are generated in and propagate through the blackbody-emitting disk to a relatively compact ($\sim$10 $R_{g}$) inner corona. The model naturally explains why the disk variations lead coronal variations with a Fourier-frequency dependent lag at frequencies $<1$ Hz, since longer variability time-scales originate from larger disk radii. The propagating fluctuations also modulate successively the coronal seed photons from the disk, heating of the corona via viscous dissipation and the resulting reverberation signal. The interplay of these different effects leads to the observed complex pattern of lag behaviour between disk and power-law emission and different power-law energy bands, the energy-dependence of power-spectral shape and a strong dependence of spectral-timing properties on coronal geometry. The observed spectral-timing complexity is thus a natural consequence of the response of the disk-corona system to mass-accretion fluctuations propagating through the disk.

 Objective: In the framework of the Cometary Physics Laboratory (CoPhyLab) and its sublimation experiments of cometary surface analogues under simulated space conditions, we characterize the properties of intimate mixtures of juniper charcoal and SiO$_2$ chosen as a dust analogue \citep{Lethuillier_2022}. We present the details of these investigations for the spectrophotometric properties of the samples. Methods: We measured these properties using a hyperspectral imager and a radio-goniometer. From the samples' spectra, we evaluated reflectance ratios and spectral slopes. From the measured phase curves, we inverted a photometric model for all samples. Complementary characterizations were obtained using a pycnometer, a scanning electron microscope and an organic elemental analyser. Results: We report the first values for the apparent porosity, elemental composition, and VIS-NIR spectrophotometric properties for juniper charcoal, as well as for intimate mixtures of this charcoal with the SiO$_2$. We find that the juniper charcoal drives the spectrophotometric properties of the intimate mixtures and that its strong absorbance is consistent with its elemental composition. We find that SiO$_2$ particles form large and compact agglomerates in every mixture imaged with the electron microscope, and its spectrophotometric properties are affected by such features and their particle-size distribution. We compare our results to the current literature on comets and other small Solar System bodies and find that most of the characterized properties of the dust analogue are comparable to some extent with the spacecraft-visited cometary nucleii, as well as to Centaurs, Trojans and the bluest TNOs.

 - **Abstract**
 1D stellar evolution calculations produce uncertain predictions for quantities like the age, core mass, core compactness, and nucleo-synthetic yields; a key source of uncertainty is the modeling of interfaces between regions that are convectively stable and those that are not. Theoretical and numerical work has demonstrated that there should be numerous processes adjacent to the convective boundary that induce chemical and angular momentum transport, as well as modify the thermal structure of the star. One such process is called convective penetration, wherein vigorous convection extends beyond the nominal convective boundary and alters both the composition and thermal structure. In this work, we incorporate the process of convective penetration in stellar evolution calculations using the stellar evolution software instrument mesa. We implement convective penetration according to the description presented by Anders et al. (2022a) to calculate a grid of models from the pre main sequence to He core depletion. The extent of the convective penetration zone is self-consistently calculated at each time step without introducing new free parameters. We find both a substantial penetration zone in all models with a convective core and observable differences to global stellar properties such as the luminosity and radius. We preset how the predicted radial extent of the penetration zone scales with the total stellar mass, age and the metallicity of the star. We discuss our results in the context of existing numerical and observational studies.

 - **Abstract**
 When observing the atmospheres of transiting exoplanets using high-resolution spectroscopy, one aims to detect well-resolved spectral features with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) as is possible today with modern spectrographs. However, obtaining such high-quality observations comes with a trade-off: a lower cadence of fewer, longer exposures across the transit collects more photons thanks to reduced overheads, enhancing the SNR of each observation, while a higher cadence of several, shorter exposures minimises spectral feature smearing due to the continuously changing radial velocity of the planet. Considering that maximising SNR and minimising smearing are both beneficial to analysis, there is a need to establish where the optimal compromise lies. In this work, we model real transit events based on targets as they would be observed with VLT/CRIRES+ at Paranal Observatory. Creating four hypothetical scenarios, we simulate each observation across 100 realisations of the same transit event in order to vary the time resolution only. We remove telluric and stellar lines using the SYSREM algorithm and analyse them through cross-correlation with model templates, measuring how successfully each time resolution and case detects the planetary signal. We demonstrate that there is a continuous change in the detection significance based on time resolutions, and that the function of this significance has clear maxima. The strength and location of this maxima varies on e.g. planet system parameters, instrumentation, and no. of removal iterations. We discuss why observers should therefore take several factors into account, using a strategy akin to the 'exposure triangle' from traditional photography where a balance must be struck by considering the full context of the observation. Our method is robust and may be employed by observers to estimate best observational strategies for other targets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a technique for verifying or refuting exoplanet candidates from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission by searching for nearby eclipsing binary stars using higher-resolution archival images from ground-based telescopes. Our new system is called Detecting and Evaluating A Transit: finding its Hidden Source in Time-domain Archival Records (DEATHSTAR). We downloaded time series of cutout images from two ground-based telescope surveys (the Zwicky Transient Facility, or ZTF, and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, or ATLAS), analyzed the images to create apertures and measure the brightness of each star in the field, and plotted the resulting light curves using custom routines. Thus far, we have confirmed on-target transits for 17 planet candidates, and identified 35 false positives and located their actual transit sources. With future improvements to automation, DEATHSTAR will be scaleable to run on the majority of TOIs.
