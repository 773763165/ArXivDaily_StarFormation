          Study of Wide-Field-of-View X-ray Observations of the Virgo Cluster Using the Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy

 - **Abstract**
 The Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy (LEIA) is the pathfinder of the wide-field X-ray telescope used in the Einstein Probe mission. In this study, we present an image of the Virgo Cluster taken by LEIA in the 0.5-4.5 keV band with an exposure time of $\sim$17.3 ks in the central region. This extended emission is generally consistent with the results obtained by ROSAT. However, the field is affected by bright point sources due to the instrument's Point Spread Function (PSF) effect. Through fitting of the LEIA spectrum of the Virgo Cluster, we obtained a temperature of $2.1^{+0.3}_{-0.1}$ keV, which is consistent with the XMM-Newton results ($\sim$2.3 keV). Above 1.6 keV, the spectrum is dominated by the X-ray background. In summary, this study validates LEIA's extended source imaging and spectral resolution capabilities for the first time.

          Chemical abundance gradients of organic molecules within a protostellar disk

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of low-mass protostellar systems show evidence of rich complex organic chemistry. Their low luminosity, however, makes determining abundance distributions of complex organic molecules (COMs) within the water snowline challenging. However, the excitation conditions sampled by differing molecular distributions may produce substantive changes in the resulting emission. Thus, molecular excitation may recover spatial information from spatially unresolved data. By analyzing spatially-unresolved NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) observations of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN, we aim to determine if CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN are distributed differently in the protostellar disk around HOPS-370, a highly-luminous intermediate mass protostar. Rotational diagram analysis of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN yields rotational temperatures of $198 \pm 1.2$ K and $448 \pm 19$ K, respectively, suggesting the two molecules have different spatial distributions. Source-specific 3D LTE radiative transfer models are used to constrain the spatial distribution of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN within the disk. A uniform distribution with an abundance of $4\times10^{-8}$ reproduces the CH$_3$OH observations. In contrast, the spatial distribution of CH$_3$CN needs to be either more compact (within $\sim120$ au versus $\sim240$ au for CH$_3$OH) or exhibiting a factor of $\gtrsim 15$ increase in abundance in the inner $\sim55$ au. A possible explanation for the difference in spatial abundance distributions of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN is carbon-grain sublimation.

          Leveraging protohalos and scale-dependent bias to calibrate the BAO scale in real space

 - **Abstract**
 The location of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the two-point correlation function (2PCF) of matter produces a standard ruler that is useful for the measurement of the expansion history of the Universe. Inspired by the possibility of reconstructing the positions of protohalos in the initial density field with a novel method rooted in optimal transport theory, we revisit the BAO signal in the protohalo correlation function. Our work examines the performance of a template 2PCF built on a tracer bias relation that includes scale dependence -- a term that can be motivated by peaks theory or a general bias expansion. Working in protohalos, halos, and the linear combination of the protohalo and matter fields that is motivated by the continuity equation, we demonstrate that this model accurately captures the shape of the BAO feature and improves the precision of the BAO scale measurement relative to a model that does not include scale-dependent bias by 47% in protohalos, 15% in halos, and 14% in the linear combination of the protohalo and matter fields. Allowing for scale dependence does not appear to introduce any shift in the BAO feature. The precision of the BAO distance scale estimate is highest with the linear combination of the protohalo and matter fields, which offers a factor of 3.5 improvement over Eulerian-space measurements and a factor of 4-8 improvement over the estimate made with protohalos alone.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of compact stellar remnants in the mass range $2-5\,M_{\odot}$ has long been debated. This so-called lower mass gap was initially suggested by the lack of low-mass X-ray binary observations with accretors in this mass range, but it has recently been called into question following newer observations, including a lower-mass-gap candidate with a millisecond pulsar companion in the dense globular cluster NGC~1851. Here we model NGC~1851 with a grid of similar dense star clusters utilizing the state-of-the-art Monte Carlo $N$-body code \texttt{CMC}, and we specifically study the formation of lower-mass-gap black holes. We demonstrate that both massive star evolution and dynamical interactions can contribute to forming lower-mass-gap black holes. In general, the collapse of massive remnants formed through mergers of neutron stars or massive white dwarfs produces the largest number of lower-mass-gap black holes among all formation channels. However, in more massive clusters, supernova core collapse can contribute comparable numbers. Our NGC~1851-like models can reproduce millisecond pulsar -- lower-mass-gap black hole binaries similar to the observed system. Additionally, the lower-mass-gap black holes can also become components of dynamically assembled binaries, and some will be in merging black hole--neutron star systems similar to the recently detected gravitational wave source GW230529. However, the corresponding merger rate is probably $\lesssim 1~{\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$.

          Approximating Rayleigh Scattering in Exoplanetary Atmospheres using Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

 - **Abstract**
 This research introduces an innovative application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to tackle the intricate challenges of radiative transfer (RT) modeling in exoplanetary atmospheres, with a special focus on efficiently handling scattering phenomena. Traditional RT models often simplify scattering as absorption, leading to inaccuracies. Our approach utilizes PINNs, noted for their ability to incorporate the governing differential equations of RT directly into their loss function, thus offering a more precise yet potentially fast modeling technique. The core of our method involves the development of a parameterized PINN tailored for a modified RT equation, enhancing its adaptability to various atmospheric scenarios. We focus on RT in transiting exoplanet atmospheres using a simplified 1D isothermal model with pressure-dependent coefficients for absorption and Rayleigh scattering. In scenarios of pure absorption, the PINN demonstrates its effectiveness in predicting transmission spectra for diverse absorption profiles. For Rayleigh scattering, the network successfully computes the RT equation, addressing both direct and diffuse stellar light components. While our preliminary results with simplified models are promising, indicating the potential of PINNs in improving RT calculations, we acknowledge the errors stemming from our approximations as well as the challenges in applying this technique to more complex atmospheric conditions. Specifically, extending our approach to atmospheres with intricate temperature-pressure profiles and varying scattering properties, such as those introduced by clouds and hazes, remains a significant area for future development.

          Shocking and Mass Loss of Compact Donor Stars in Type Ia Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs accreting from a binary companion. Following the explosion, the surviving donor star leaves at roughly its orbital velocity. The discovery of the runaway helium subdwarf star US 708, and seven hypervelocity stars from Gaia data, all with spatial velocities $\gtrsim 900$ km/s, strongly support a scenario in which the donor is a low-mass helium star, or a white dwarf. Motivated by these discoveries, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with the $\texttt{Athena++}$ code modeling the hydrodynamical interaction between a helium star or helium white dwarf, and the supernova ejecta. We find that $\approx 0.01-0.02\,M_{\odot}$ of donor material is stripped, and explain the location of the stripped material within the expanding supernova ejecta. We continue the post-explosion evolution of the shocked donor stars with the $\texttt{MESA}$ code. As a result of entropy deposition, they remain luminous and expanded for $\approx 10^{5}-10^{6}$ yrs. We show that the post-explosion properties of our helium white dwarf donor agree reasonably with one of the best-studied hypervelocity stars, D6-2.

          Characterization of the $\delta$ Scuti eclipsing binary KIC 4851217 and its tertiary companion as well as detection of tidally tilted pulsations

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar theory enables us to understand the properties of stars at different stages of their evolution, and contributes to other fields of astrophysics such as galactic and exoplanet studies. Assessing the accuracy of stellar theories necessitates high precision, model-independent measurements of the properties of real stars, such as those obtainable for the components of double lined eclipsing binaries (DLEBs), while asteroseismology offers probing power of the stellar interior if one or both components pulsate. KIC 4851217 is a DLEB containing two late A-type stars and exhibits pulsations of the $\delta$ Scuti type. By analysing high resolution HERMES and moderate resolution ISIS spectra, jointly with Kepler and TESS light curves, we measured the masses, radii and effective temperatures of the components to precisions of ~0.5, ~1.1 and ~1 per cent, respectively. We additionally report the discovery and characterisation of a tertiary M-dwarf companion. Models of the system's spectral energy distribution agree with an age of 0.82 Gyr, with the more massive and larger secondary component near the end of the main sequence lifetime. An examination of the pulsating component's pulsation frequencies reveals 39 pulsation multiplets that are split by the orbital frequency. For most of these, it is evident that the pulsation axes have been tilted into the orbital plane. This makes KIC 4851217 a tidally tilted pulsator (TTP). This precisely characterized $\delta$ Scuti DLEB is an ideal candidate for advancing intermediate-mass stellar theory, contributing to our understanding of hierarchichal systems as well as to the topic of TTPs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first results of the holographic beam mapping program for the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). We describe the implementation of the holographic technique as adapted for CHIME, and introduce the processing pipeline which prepares the raw holographic timestreams for analysis of beam features. We use data from six bright sources across the full 400-800\,MHz observing band of CHIME to provide measurements of the co-polar and cross-polar beam response of CHIME in both amplitude and phase for the 1024 dual-polarized feeds instrumented on CHIME. In addition, we present comparisons with independent probes of the CHIME beam which indicate the presence of polarized beam leakage in CHIME. Holographic measurements of the CHIME beam have already been applied in science with CHIME, e.g. in estimating detection significance of far sidelobe FRBs, and in validating the beam models used for CHIME's first detections of \tcm emission (in cross-correlation with measurements of large-scale structure from galaxy surveys and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest). Measurements presented in this paper, and future holographic results, will provide a unique data set to characterize the CHIME beam and improve the experiment's prospects for a detection of BAO.

 - **Abstract**
 As part of the Bristol PROVE mission, a nano satellite in low Earth orbit will be required to track a ground based target during a 400 second flyover. This requires agile attitude control that will be achieved using a system of flywheels. To calculate the necessary torque from these flywheels, a controller was designed. Using newly derived equations of motion for the system, an expression to optimise the gains was produced. With this controller, simulations were run to evaluate the largest causes of error in target pointing. Disturbance torques were safely handled by the controller, but led to a 12% increase in wheel speeds, reaching 8325 rpm. This higher speed led to an increased gyroscopic torque, reaching 10^-7 Nm in the worst case. However since the flywheels can deliver 10^-5 Nm of torque, the controller could also correct for this. Hardware performance was then varied to assess the effect of each component on pointing accuracy. Attitude sensor noise was found to increase pointing error by 1.9 degrees in the worst case. Minimum performance requirements were then determined for each component in order to maintain an acceptable pointing accuracy.

          Flare Accelerated Electrons in Kappa-Distribution from X-Ray Spectra with Warm-Target Model

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray observations provide essential and valuable insights into the acceleration and propagation of non-thermal electrons during solar flares. Improved X-ray spectral analysis requires a deeper understanding of the dynamics of energetic electrons. Previous studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of accelerated electrons of a few thermal speeds are more complex. To better describe the energetic electrons after injection, a model considering energy diffusion and thermalization effects in flare conditions (warm-target model) has recently been developed for Hard X-ray spectral analysis. This model has demonstrated how the low-energy cut-off, which can hardly be constrained in cold-target modeling, can be determined. However, the power-law form may not be the most suitable representation of injected electrons. The kappa distribution, which is proposed as a physical consequence of electron acceleration, has shown successful application in RHESSI spectral analysis. In this study, we employ the kappa-form injected electrons in the warm-target model to analyze two M-class flares, observed by RHESSI and STIX, respectively. The best-fit results show that the kappa-form energetic electron spectrum generates lower non-thermal energy when producing a similar photon spectrum in the fit range compared to the power-law form. We also demonstrated that the fit parameters associated with kappa-form electron spectrum can be well determined with small fit uncertainty. Further, the kappa distribution, which covers the entire electron energy range, enables the determination of key electron properties such as total electron number density and average energy in the flare site, providing valuable information on electron acceleration processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanetary science is increasingly prioritizing efforts toward direct imaging of planetary systems, with emphasis on those that may enable the detection and characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets. The recent 2020 Astronomy and Astrophysics decadal survey recommended the development of a space-based direct imaging mission that has subsequently been referred to as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). A fundamental challenge in the preparatory work for the HWO search for exo-Earths is the selection of suitable stellar targets. Much of the prior efforts regarding the HWO targets has occurred within the context of exoplanet surveys that have characterized the stellar properties for the nearest stars. The preliminary input catalog for HWO consists of 164 stars, of which 30 are known exoplanet hosts to 70 planets. Here, we provide a dynamical analysis for these 30 systems, injecting a terrestrial planet mass into the Habitable Zone (HZ) and determining the constraints on stable orbit locations due to the influence of the known planets. For each system, we calculate the percentage of the HZ that is dynamically viable for the potential presence of a terrestrial planet, providing an additional metric for inclusion of the stars within the HWO target list. Our analysis shows that, for 11 of the systems, less than 50% of the HZ is dynamically viable, primarily due to the presence of giant planets whose orbits pass near or through the HZ. These results demonstrate the impact that known system architectures can have on direct imaging target selection and overall system habitability.

 - **Abstract**
 Precise cosmological measurements are essential for understanding the evolution of the universe and the nature of dark energy. The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), the most sensitive single-dish radio telescope, has the potential to provide the precise cosmological measurements through neutral hydrogen 21-cm intensity mapping sky survey. This paper primarily explores the potential of technological upgrades for FAST in cosmology. The most crucial upgrade begins with equipping FAST with a wide-band receiver ($0 < z < 2.5$). This upgrade can enable FAST to achieve higher precision in cosmological parameter estimation than the Square Kilometre Array Phase-1 Mid frequency. On this basis, expanding to a FAST array (FASTA) consisting of six identical FAST would offer significant improvements in precision compared to FAST. Additionally, compared with the current results from the data combination of cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations (optical galaxy surveys), and type Ia supernovae, FASTA can provide comparable constraints. Specifically, for the dark-energy equation-of-state parameters, FASTA can achieve $\sigma(w_0) = 0.09$ and $\sigma(w_a) = 0.33$.

          Effects of Variable Mass, Disk-Like Structure, and Radiation Pressure on the Dynamics of Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we intend to investigate the dynamics of the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem. Here we assumed the primaries as the source of radiation and have variable mass. The gravitational perturbation from disk-like structure are also considered in this study. There exist five equilibrium points in this system. By considering the combined effect from disk-like structure and the mass transfer, we found that the classical collinear equilibrium points depart from x-axis. Meanwhile, this combined effect also breaks the symmetry of tringular equlibrium point positions. We noted that the quasi-equilibrium points are unstable whereas the triangular equilibrium points are stable if the mass ratio $\mu$ smaller than critical mass $\mu_c$. It shows that the stability of triangular equilibrium points depends on time.

 - **Abstract**
 The first observation of a gravitational wave (GW) and a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) emitted by the same binary neutron star (BNS) merger officially opened the field of GW multi-messenger astronomy. In this paper, we define and address \textit{lagging sirens}, a new class of multi-messenger BNSs for which associated GWs and sGRBs are observed without the identification of their host galaxy. We propose a new methodology to use the observed time delay of these sources to constrain the speed of gravity that is, the propagation speed of gravitational waves, the Hubble constant and the prompt time delay distribution between GWs and sGRBs, even though a direct redshift estimation from the host galaxy is unavailable. Our method exploits the intrinsic relation between GWs and sGRBs observed and prompt time delays to obtain a statistical redshift measure for the cosmological sources. We show that this technique can be used to infer the Hubble constant at the $10\%$~level of precision with future-generation GW detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and only 100 observations of this kind. The novel procedure that we propose has systematics that differ completely from the ones of previous GW methods for cosmology. Additionally, we demonstrate for the first time that the speed of gravity and the distribution of the prompt time-delays between GWs and sGRBs can be inferred conjointly with less than 10 sources even with current GW detector sensitivities.

          Anti-correlation between Flux and Photon Index of Hard X-ray Emission from The Crab

 - **Abstract**
 Using \textit{Swift} Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) event-mode data during Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) occurrences, we conducted spectral analysis for the Crab system. From 38 good observations, which spans over a period of 18 years from 2006 to 2023, we found that the Crab's X-ray flux does not only flicker, but also significantly anti-correlates to its spectral power-law photon index. Since emission contribution of the Crab pulsar in this energy range is small, this anti-correlation is mainly about the emission of the Crab nebula. We suggest that this anti-correlation is an observational supporting evidence for the long-standing notion that the nebula emission is due to synchrotron radiation of shocked pulsar winds in the nebula.

 The AGORA Cosmorun (arXiv:2106.09738) is a set of hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations carried out within the AGORA High-resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project (arXiv:1308.2669,arXiv:1610.03066). These simulations show the formation and evolution of a Milky Way-sized galaxy using eight of the most widely used numerical codes in the community (Art-I, Enzo, Ramses, Changa, Gadget-3, Gear, Gizmo, and Arepo). In this short report, we describe the public release of the raw output data from all of these simulations at z = 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 (plus at z=1, 0 when available), and several metadata files containing the halo centers, virial quantities, and merger trees. The data from even thinner timesteps will be released as soon as the upcoming collaboration papers (VII-IX) are submitted and accepted.

 - **Abstract**
 Tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling, caused by the jitter of test masses or satellites, is a significant noise source in space-based gravitational wave detection. Calibrating and suppressing TTL coupling noise at the sub-nanometer level is essential. One main challenge in current ground-based TTL coupling testing is the residual translational movement of the tilt actuator. This paper introduces the development of an advanced pure tilt actuator (APTA) specifically designed for testing TTL coupling. The APTA provides precise tilt motion and is monitored by a four-beam interferometer, which measures the displacement of attached array pyramids. We present a detailed theoretical model and experimental setup. Experimental results demonstrate that this optical test bed, equipped with the APTA, can achieve subnanometer-level TTL coupling calibration. In addition, a typical heterodyne interferometer was tested using the APTA test bed. Comparative testing demonstrated that the imaging system is capable of effectively suppressing TTL coupling errors. The TTL coupling coefficients were reduced from over plus-minus 30 micrometers per radian to within plus-minus 5 micrometers per radian across a range of plus-minus 200 microradians, meeting the preliminary requirements for the TianQin mission. This APTA test platform has the potential to be widely utilized for ground-based TTL coupling inspection.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs) based on the results of our fallback core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations. We find that the predicted SGWB is mainly determined by the typical CCSN initial explosion energy and progenitor metallicity. For the optimistic cases in which the typical initial explosion energy is low, the SGWB from NDAFs without disk outflows might be detected by next-generation space-based interferometers such as Decihertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) and Big Bang Observer (BBO). In the low-frequency regime $\sim10^{-3}-10^{-1}$ Hz, this background is comparable to that expected from standard inflationary models. Therefore, the SGWB from NDAFs may become a foreground for searches of the SGWB generated in the inflationary epoch. Combining the diffuse NDAF neutrino background and SGWB from NDAFs, one may constrain the properties of the CCSNe and NDAFs.

 - **Abstract**
 Present cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations have significantly advanced our understanding of the universe's origin, especially with primordial gravitational waves (PGWs). Currently, ground-based CMB telescopes are mainly located in the southern hemisphere, leaving an untapped potential for observations in the northern hemisphere. In this work, we investigate the perspective of a northern hemisphere CMB polarization telescope (NHT) to detect PGWs and present mock data for such a project. We forecast the detection sensitivity on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r of NHT and compare it with the existed ground-based experiments, also search for optimal experimental configurations that can achieve the best sensitivity of r. Our results indicate that, considering realistic experimental conditions, the first year of NHT observations combined with Planck can achieve a precision of \sigma (r)= 0.015, reaching the level of BICEP2/Keck, with significant potential for improvement with subsequent instrumentation parameter enhancements.

 - **Abstract**
 We homogeneously measured the elliptical shapes of 163 globular clusters (GCs) using the on-sky distribution of their cluster members and the third data release of the ESA mission Gaia (DR3). The astrometry enables the differentiation of stars within clusters from those in the field. This feature is particularly valuable for clusters located in densely populated areas of the sky, where conventional methods for measuring the geometry of the GCs are not applicable. The median axial ratio of our full sample is $\langle b/a \rangle = 0.935^{+0.033}_{-0.090}$ and $0.986^{+0.009}_{-0.004}$ for the subset of 11 GCs previously studied based on Hubble Space Telescope imaging. We investigated whether the minor axis of the ellipses can be interpreted as a pseudo-rotation axis by comparing it to measurements of cluster rotation. Using the radial velocities from Gaia, we detected rotation for three clusters, NGC 5139, NGC 104, and NGC 6341, and observed an alignment between the pseudo-rotation axis and the 2D projection of the real rotation axis. To expand the set of clusters for which rotation has been detected, we analyzed multiple literature references. Depending on the reference used for comparison, we observed an alignment in between 76% to 100% of the clusters. The lack of an alignment observed in some clusters may be linked to different scales analyzed in various studies. Several studies have demonstrated that the orientation of rotation varies with the distance from the center. We estimate that the next Gaia release will increase the number of stars with radial velocities in GCs from $\sim 10,000$ in Gaia DR3 to $\sim 55,000$ in Gaia DR4. This will enable the measurement of rotation and ellipticities at identical angular scales for additional clusters, which will help us to clarify whether the previously mentioned alignment occurs in all clusters.

 We estimate the loss of nitrogen from Pluto over its lifetime, including the giant planet instability period, which we term the "Wild Years." We analyze the orbital migration of 53 simulated Plutinos, which are Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) captured into 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Neptune during the instability. This orbital migration brought the Plutinos from 20 to 30 au to their present-day orbits near 40 au along a nonlinear path that includes orbits with semimajor axes from 10 to 100 au. We model the thermal history that results from this migration and estimate the volatile loss rates due to the ever-changing thermal environment. Due to the early Sun's enhanced ultraviolet radiation, the photochemical destruction rate during the Wild Years was a factor of 100 higher than the present-day rate, but this only results in a loss of ~10 m global equivalent layer (GEL). The enhanced Jeans escape rate varies wildly with time, and a net loss of ~100 cm GEL is predicted. Additionally, we model the impact history during the migration and find that impacts are a net source, not loss, of N2, contributing ~100 cm GEL. The 100 cm GEL is 0.1% of the amount of N2 in Sputnik Planitia. We therefore conclude that Pluto did not lose an excessive amount of volatiles during the Wild Years, and its primordial volatile inventory can be approximated as its present-day inventory. However, significant fractions of this small total loss of N2 occurred during the Wild Years, so estimates made using present-day rates will be underestimates.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the validation of two TESS super-Earth candidates transiting the mid-M dwarfs TOI-6002 and TOI-5713 every 10.90 and 10.44 days, respectively. The first star (TOI-6002) is located $32.038\pm0.019$ pc away, with a radius of $0.2409^{+0.0066}_{-0.0065} R_\odot$, a mass of $0.2105^{+0.0049}_{-0.0048} M_\odot$ and an effective temperature of $3229^{+77}_{-57}$ K. The second star (TOI-5713) is located $40.946\pm0.032$ pc away, with a radius of $0.2985^{+0.0073}_{-0.0072} R_\odot$, a mass of $0.2653\pm0.0061 M_\odot$ and an effective temperature of $3225^{+41}_{-40}$ K. We validated the planets using TESS data, ground-based multi-wavelength photometry from many ground-based facilities, as well as high-resolution AO observations from Keck/NIRC2. TOI-6002 b has a radius of $1.65^{+0.22}_{-0.19} R_\oplus$ and receives $1.77^{+0.16}_{-0.11} S_\oplus$. TOI-5713 b has a radius of $1.77_{-0.11}^{+0.13} R_\oplus$ and receives $2.42\pm{0.11} S_\oplus$. Both planets are located near the radius valley and near the inner edge of the habitable zone of their host stars, which makes them intriguing targets for future studies to understand the formation and evolution of small planets around M-dwarf stars.

          SOLES XI. The Aligned Orbit of TOI-2533 b, a Transiting Brown Dwarf Orbiting an F8-type Star

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs occupy a middle ground in mass space between gaseous giant planets and ultra-cool dwarf stars, and the characterisation of their orbital orientations may shed light on how these neighbouring objects form. We present an analysis of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect across the transit of TOI-2533 $b$, a brown dwarf on a moderately eccentric ($e_b = 0.2476\pm0.0090$) and wide-separation ($a_b/R_\star = 13.34\pm0.30$) orbit around an F8-type star, using data from the NEID/WIYN spectrograph in combination with archival photometry and radial velocity observations. Spin-orbit analyses of brown dwarfs are relatively rare, and TOI-2533 stands out as the fifth brown dwarf system with a measured spin-orbit constraint. We derive a sky-projected stellar obliquity of $\lambda = -7\pm14^{\circ}$ for TOI-2533 $b$, finding that the brown dwarf is consistent with spin-orbit alignment. Our joint model also indicates that TOI-2533 $b$ falls near the lower bound of the hydrogen-burning minimum mass range (M$_b$ = $74.9\pm5.3$ M$_{\rm \tiny Jup}$). Ultimately, we find that TOI-2533 $b$ is consistent with formation from disc fragmentation in a primordially spin-orbit aligned orientation, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the system has been tidally realigned during its lifetime.

          Investigating the role of nuclear parameters on oscillation modes in hot Neutron Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies have revealed that certain nuclear parameters are more dominant than others in governing global neutron star properties, such as its structure or oscillation mode characteristics. Although neutron stars can in general assumed to be cold, in astrophysical scenarios such as newly born neutron stars or remnants of binary neutron star mergers, finite temperature effects play a non-negligible role. In this work, we perform a consistent and systematic investigation of the role of nuclear parameters and thermal effects on neutron star properties and fluid oscillation modes within a full general relativistic scheme. We impose constraints on the parameter space of the relativistic mean field model using state-of-the-art information from terrestrial experiments and multi-messenger astrophysical data. We find effective nucleon mass to be the most important nuclear parameter controlling astrophysical observables of hot neutron stars, similar to the cold beta equilibrated matter. However, we conclude that the interplay among saturation properties and astrophysical observables depends not only on the thermal configurations considered but also on the constraints imposed. We also investigated the role of nuclear saturation parameters on some universal relations for hot NSs which are important in gravitational wave asteroseismology. Our investigation confirmed that these relations are mostly insensitive to nuclear saturation properties and mainly affected by variation of charge fraction in the star.

          North Polar Spur: gaseous plume(s) from star-forming regions at $\sim$3-5 kpc from Galactic Center?

 - **Abstract**
 We argue that the North Polar Spur (NPS) and many less prominent structures are formed by gaseous metal-rich plumes associated with star-forming regions (SFRs). The SFRs located at the tangent to the 3-5 kpc rings might be particularly relevant to NPS. A multi-temperature mixture of gaseous components and cosmic rays rises above the Galactic disk under the action of their initial momentum and buoyancy. Eventually, the plume velocity becomes equal to that of the ambient gas, which rotates with different angular speed than the stars in the disk. As a result, the plumes acquire characteristic bent shapes. An ad hoc model of plumes' trajectories shows an interesting resemblance to the morphology of structures seen in the radio continuum and X-rays.
