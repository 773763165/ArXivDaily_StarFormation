#### Single Millisecond Pulsars from Dynamical Interaction Processes in Dense  Star Clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) are particularly efficient at forming millisecond pulsars. Among these pulsars, about half lack a companion star, a significantly higher fraction than in the Galactic field. This fraction increases further in some of the densest GCs, especially those that have undergone core collapse, suggesting that dynamical interaction processes play a key role. For the first time, we create N-body models that reproduce the ratio of single-to-binary pulsars in Milky-Way-like GCs. We focus especially on NGC 6752, a typical core-collapsed cluster with many observed millisecond pulsars. Previous studies suggested that an increased rate of neutron star binary disruption in the densest clusters could explain the overabundance of single pulsars in these systems. Here, we demonstrate that binary disruption is ineffective and instead we propose that two additional dynamical processes play the dominant role: (1) tidal disruption of main-sequence stars by neutron stars; and (2) gravitational collapse of heavy white-dwarf-binary merger remnants. Neutron stars formed through these processes may also be associated with fast radio bursts similar to those observed recently in an extragalactic GC.

 - **Abstract**
 We continue the study of dipole cosmology framework put forward in \cite{Krishnan:2022qbv}, a beyond FLRW setting that has a preferred direction in the metric which may be associated with a cosmological tilt, a cosmic dipole. In this setup the shear and the tilt can be positive or negative given the dipole direction. Here we focus on the behaviour near the Big Bang (BB) in this setting. We first analyze a single fluid model with a generic constant equation of state $w$. In this case shear and the tilt have the same signs. While details of the behavior near the BB depends on $w$ and the other initial conditions, we find that when the shear is negative we have a shear dominated BB singularity, whereas for a positive shear we have a much milder singularity, the whimper singularity \cite{Ellis:1974ug}, at which the tilt blows up while curvature invariants remain finite. We also analyze dipole $\Lambda$CDM model and explore its near BB behavior, which besides the shear has two tilt parameters, one for radiation and one for the pressureless matter. For positive (negative) shear we again find whimper (curvature) singularity. Moreover, when the tilt parameters have opposite signs, the shear can change sign from negative to positive in the course of evolution of the Universe. We show that the relative tilt of the radiation and the matter generically remains sizeable at late times.
#### Crowded No More: The Accuracy of the Hubble Constant Tested\\with High  Resolution Observations of Cepheids by JWST

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution JWST observations can test confusion-limited HST observations for a photometric bias that could affect extragalactic Cepheids and the determination of the Hubble constant. We present JWST NIRCAM observations in two epochs and three filters of >330 Cepheids in NGC4258 (which has a 1.5% maser-based geometric distance) and in NGC5584 (host of SNIa 2007af), near the median distance of the SH0ES HST SNIa host sample and with the best leverage among them to detect such a bias. JWST provides far superior source separation from line-of-sight companions than HST in the NIR to largely negate confusion or crowding noise at these wavelengths, where extinction is minimal. The result is a remarkable >2.5x reduction in the dispersion of the Cepheid P-L relations, from 0.45 to 0.17 mag, improving individual Cepheid precision from 20% to 7%. Two-epoch photometry confirmed identifications, tested JWST photometric stability, and constrained Cepheid phases. The P-L relation intercepts are in very good agreement, with differences (JWST-HST) of 0.00+/-0.03 and 0.02+/-0.03 mag for NGC4258 and NGC5584, respectively. The difference in the determination of H_0 between HST and JWST from these intercepts is 0.02+/-0.04 mag, insensitive to JWST zeropoints or count-rate non-linearity thanks to error cancellation between rungs. We explore a broad range of analysis variants (including passband combinations, phase corrections, measured detector offsets, and crowding levels) indicating robust baseline results. These observations provide the strongest evidence yet that systematic errors in HST Cepheid photometry do not play a significant role in the present Hubble Tension. Upcoming JWST observations of >12 SNIa hosts should further refine the local measurement of the Hubble constant.

 - **Abstract**
 In the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3), LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA have observed binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to redshifts $z_\mathrm{merge}\approx1$. Because gravitational waves (GWs) are inefficient at shrinking the binary orbit, some of these BBH systems likely experienced long delay times $\tau$ between the formation of their progenitor stars at $z_\mathrm{form}$ and their GW merger at $z_\mathrm{merge}$. The distribution of delay times predicted by isolated binary evolution resembles a power law $p(\tau)\propto\tau^{\alpha_\tau}$ with slope $-1\lesssim\alpha_\tau\lesssim-0.35$ and a minimum delay time of $\tau_\mathrm{min}=10$ Myr. We use these predicted delay time distributions to infer the formation redshifts of the $\sim70$ BBH events reported in GWTC-3 and measure the BBH progenitor formation rate out to $z_\mathrm{form}\approx3$. For our default $\alpha_\tau=-1$ delay time distribution, we find that GWTC-3 contains at least one system (with 90\% credibility) that formed earlier than $z_\mathrm{form}>3.2$. Comparing our inferred BBH progenitor rate to the star formation rate (SFR), we find that at $z_\mathrm{form}=3$, the number of BBH progenitor systems formed per stellar mass was $4.3^{+4.9}_{-3.6}\times10^{-6}M_\odot^{-1}$ and this yield dropped to $0.2^{+1.7}_{-0.2}\times10^{-6}M_\odot^{-1}$ by $z_\mathrm{form}=0$. We discuss implications of this measurement for the cosmic metallicity evolution, finding that for typical assumptions about the metallicity-dependence of the BBH yield, the average metallicity at $z_\mathrm{form}=3$ was $\langle\log_{10}(Z/Z_\odot)\rangle=-0.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$, although the inferred metallicity can vary by a factor of $\approx3$ for different assumptions about the BBH yield.
#### Observability of flashes from ejecta crashes in aspherical supernovae,  with application to SN 2008D

 - **Abstract**
 A new class of transient, which has been hypothesized to accompany the explosion of an aspherical compact supernova, would arise when streams of ejecta collide outside the star. However, conditions that favour the prompt release of radiation from the collision, such as a diffuse stellar envelope, disfavour the creation of non-radial ejecta in the first place. To determine whether the collision can both occur and be visible, we simulate aspherical explosions using the HUJI-RICH moving-mesh hydrodynamics code and analyze them in terms of diffusion measures defined for individual fluid elements. While our simulations are highly idealized, they connect to realistic explosions via a single dimensionless parameter. Defining two measures of the importance of diffusivity (two versions of the inverse P'eclet number), we find that one varies in a way that indicates colliding ejecta can release a photon flash, while the other does not. Examining the x-ray transient XT 080109 associated with supernova SN 2008D, we find that its fluence and duration are consistent with the properties of an ejecta collision in the aspherical model that is most likely to emit a flash. Our results give tentative evidence for the possibility of collision-induced flashes for a narrow and radius-dependent range of asphericity, and motivate future radiation hydrodynamics simulations.
#### Enhanced Size Uniformity for Near-Resonant Planets

 - **Abstract**
 Super-Earths within the same close-in, compact planetary system tend to exhibit a striking degree of uniformity in their radius, mass, and orbital spacing, and this 'peas-in-a-pod' phenomenon itself serves to provide one of the strongest constrains on planet formation at large. While it has been recently demonstrated from independent samples that such planetary uniformity occurs for both configurations near and distant from mean motion resonance (MMR), the question thus remains if the strength of this uniformity itself differs between near-resonant and non-resonant configurations such that the two modes may be astrophysically distinct in their evolution. We thus provide in this work a novel comparative size uniformity analysis for 48 near-resonant and 251 non-resonant multi-planet systems from the California Kepler Survey (CKS) catalog, evaluating uniformity both across systems and between planetary pairs within the same system. We find that while multi-planet configurations exhibit strong peas-in-a-pod size uniformity regardless of their proximity to resonance, near-resonant configurations display enhanced intra-system size uniformity as compared to their analogous non-resonant counterparts at the level of both entire systems and sub-system planetary pairs and chains. These results are broadly consistent with a variety of formation paradigms for multiple-planet systems, such as convergent migration within a turbulent protoplanetary disk or planet-planet interactions incited by postnebular dynamical instabilities. Nevertheless, further investigation is necessary to ascertain whether the non-resonant and near-resonant planetary configurations respectively evolve via a singular process or mechanisms that are dynamically distinct.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Certain periodic variations of radial velocities (RV) of wobbling giants originate from exoplanets. Indeed, a number of exoplanets have been discovered around giant stars. Aims. The purpose of our study is to find low-amplitude and long-period RV variations around bright M (super) giants in the RGB (or AGB) stage, which are long-period variables (LPVs) or high-proper-motion (HPM) stars. Methods. High-resolution, fiber-fed Bohyunsan Observatory Echelle Spectrograph (BOES) at the Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory (BOAO) was used to record numerous spectra of nine giants. The observation period for the targets spans 16 years, from 2005 to 2022. Results. We found from the precise RV observations of nine M giants two sub-stellar companions, one with a 28.26$^{+2.05}_{-2.17}$ $M_{J}$ orbiting period of 663.87$^{+4.61}_{-4.31}$ days at a distance of 2.03$^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$ AU (HD 6860) and the other, with a 15.83$^{+2.33}_{-2.74}$ $M_{J}$ orbiting period of 466.63 $^{+1.47}_{-1.28}$ days at a distance of 1.33 $^{+0.08}_{-0.11}$ AU (HD 112300). Our estimate of the stellar parameters for HD 6860 makes it currently the largest star with a sub-stellar companion. We also found RV variations mimicking a planetary companion in HD 18884 and confirmed LPVs in two stars, HD 39801 and HD 42995. The RV variations of some stars seem to be associated with stellar activities rather than reflex orbital motion due to their companions. Such variations are also detected even for HD 6860 and HD 112300, hosting sub-stellar companions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of searches for astrophysical neutrinos of few GeV energy from compact binary mergers detected during the first months of the fourth observing run of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA interferometers. We describe our method, based on a selection of $0.5-5$ GeV neutrino events in IceCube, where we search for a statistically significant increase in the number of low-energy candidate events detected around the compact binary merger time. With these results, we constrain neutrino-emitting source populations. Finally, we compare our results with constraints set by neutrino searches at $> 10$ GeV energies and describe the complementarity of these low- and high-energy searches.
#### Combining astrometry and JUICE -- Europa Clipper radio science to  improve the ephemerides of the Galilean moons

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming JUICE and Europa Clipper missions to Jupiter's Galilean satellites will provide radio science tracking measurements of both spacecraft. Such data are expected to significantly help estimating the moons' ephemerides and related dynamical parameters. However, the two missions will yield an imbalanced dataset, with no flybys planned at Io, condensed over less than six years. Current ephemerides' solutions for the Galilean moons, on the other hand, rely on ground-based astrometry collected over more than a century which, while being less accurate, bring very valuable constraints on the long-term dynamics of the system. An improved solution for the Galilean satellites' complex dynamics could however be achieved by exploiting the existing synergies between these different observation sets. To quantify this, we merged simulated JUICE and Clipper radio science data with existing ground-based astrometric and radar observations, and performed the inversion. Our study specifically focusses on the resulting formal uncertainties in the moons' states, as well as Io's and Jupiter's tidal dissipation parameters. Adding astrometry stabilises the moons' state solution, especially beyond the missions' timelines. It furthermore reduces the uncertainties in $1/Q$ (inverse of the tidal quality factor) by a factor two to four for Jupiter, and about 30-35\% for Io. Among all data types, classical astrometry data prior to 1960 proved particularly beneficial. We also show that ground observations of Io add the most to the solution, confirming that ground observations can fill the lack of radio science data for this specific moon. We obtained a noticeable solution improvement when exploiting the complementarity between all different observation sets. These promising simulation results thus motivate future efforts to achieve a global solution from actual JUICE and Clipper radio science data.

 - **Abstract**
 The Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) collaboration has recently reported the observational evidence of a stochastic gravitational wave background. In light of the latest CPTA observation, we aim at exploring the ability of CPTA in probing new physics. Specifically, we constrain the first-order cosmological phase transitions with CPTA data, and find that the constraining result is slightly tighter than that of NANOGrav's 12.5-yr data but weaker than NANOGrav's 15-yr data. Considering the possible complexity of gravitational wave sources, we give the constraint on a mixed scenario of cosmological phase transitions and astrophysical supermassive binary black holes. Our analysis suggests that CPTA has a great potential to probe fundamental physics in the near future.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15974
 - **Abstract**
 We present an unbiased molecular line survey toward the carbon-rich circumstellar envelope CIT 6 carried out between 90 and 116 GHz with the Arizona Radio Observatory 12 m telescope. A total of 42 lines assigned to 10 molecular species and 4 isotopologues are detected. Despite the absence of any newly identified circumstellar molecules, several transitions are freshly reported for this object. This work is a complement to our previous line survey toward CIT 6 in the frequency ranges of 36-49 GHz and 131-268 GHz. Based on the measurements and in combination with previously published data, we perform a rotation-diagram analysis to determine the column densities, excitation temperatures, and fractional abundances of the molecules. The excitation temperature varies along the radius. The abundance pattern of CIT6 is broadly consistent with that of the prototype C-star IRC+10216 at the specified detection sensitivity, indicating that the molecular richness in IRC+10216 cannot be attributed to an interpretation of unusual chemistry. Nevertheless, subtle distinctions between the two C-stars are found. The higher abundance of carbon-chain molecules and lower 12C/13C ratio in CIT 6 compared to IRC+10216 imply that the former is more massive or in a more evolved phase than the latter.
#### Analytical framework for mutual approximations -- Derivation and  application to Jovian satellites

 - **Abstract**
 The apparent close encounters of two satellites in the plane of the sky, called mutual approximations, have been suggested as a different type of astrometric observation to refine the moons' ephemerides. The main observables are the central instants of the close encounters, which have the advantage of being free of any scaling and orientation errors. However, no analytical formulation is available yet for the partials of these central instants, leaving numerical approaches or alternative observables (e.g. derivatives of the apparent distance) as options. Filling that gap, this paper develops an analytical method to include central instants as direct observables in the ephemerides estimation and assesses the quality of the resulting solution. To this end, we ran a covariance analysis to compare the estimated solutions obtained with the two types of observables (central instants versus alternative observables), using the Galilean moons of Jupiter as a test case. Alternative observables can be equivalent to central instants in most cases. However, obtaining consistent solutions between the two observable types requires to accurately weigh each alternative observable individually, based on each mutual approximation's characteristics. In that case, using central instants still yields a small improvement of 10-20% of the formal errors in the radial and normal directions (RSW frame), compared to the alternative observables' solution. This improvement increases for mutual approximations with low impact parameters and large impact velocities. Choosing between the two observables thus requires careful assessment based on the characteristics of the available observations. Using central instants over alternative observables ensures that the state estimation fully benefits from the information encoded in mutual approximations, which can be desirable for certain applications.
#### Measuring the Temperature of Starspots from Multi-Filter Photometry

 - **Abstract**
 Using simultaneous multi-filter observations during the transit of an exoplanet around a K dwarf star, we determine the temperature of a starspot through modeling the radius and position with wavelength-dependent spot contrasts. We model the spot using the starspot modeling program STarSPot (STSP), which uses the transiting companion as a knife-edge probe of the stellar surface. The contrast of the spot, i.e. the ratio of the integrated flux of a darker spot region to the star's photosphere, is calculated for a range of filters and spot temperatures. We demonstrate this technique using simulated data of HAT-P-11, a K dwarf (T = 4780 K) with well-modeled starspot properties for which we obtained simultaneous multi-filter transits using LCO's MuSCAT3 instrument on the 2-meter telescope at Haleakala Observatory which allows for simultaneous, multi-filter, diffuser assisted high-precision photometry. We determine the average (i.e. a combination of penumbra and umbra) spot temperature for HAT-P-11's spot complexes is 4500 K $\pm$ 100 K using this technique. We also find for our set of filters that comparing the SDSS g' and i' filters maximizes the signal difference caused by a large spot in the transit. Thus, this technique allows for the determination of the average spot temperature using only one spot occultation in transit and can provide simultaneous information on the spot temperature and spot properties.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational waves produced by binary neutron star mergers offer a unique window into matter behavior under extreme conditions. In this context, we model analytically the effect of matter on the gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers. We start with a binary black hole system, leveraging the post-Newtonian formalism for the inspiral and the Backwards-one-Body model for the merger. We combine the two methods to generate a baseline waveform and we validate our results against numerical relativity simulations. Next, we integrate tidal effects in phase and amplitude to account for matter and spacetime interaction, by using the NRTidal model, and test its accuracy against numerical relativity predictions, for two equations of state, finding a mismatch around the merger. Subsequently, we lift the restriction on the coefficients to be independent of the tidal deformability, and recalibrate them using the numerical relativity predictions. We obtain better fits for phase and amplitude around the merger, and are able to extend the phase modeling beyond the merger. We implement our method in a new open-source Python code, steered by a Jupyter Notebook. Our research offers new perspectives on analytically modeling the effect of tides on the gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 We report an updated value for the distance to the planetary nebula NGC 6309 (the Box Nebula). The distance is found through two Kinematic Distance Methods (KDMs): the system of two equations reported in Zhu et al. 2013 and the Monte Carlo method reported by Wenger et al. 2018. We find the kinematic distance to NGC 6309 to be 4.1 kpc with an upper uncertainty of +0.29 kpc and a lower uncertainty of -0.38 kpc. We also calculate the distance to Cassiopeia A with the two KDMs and compare to the value reported by Reed et al 1995. The Zhu et al. method and Wenger et al. method yield a value within thirty percent and twenty percent of the Reed et al. method, respectively. The value reported by Reed et al 1995 was contained within the error bounds produced by the Wenger et al. method. The distance measurement to Cassiopeia A suggests that both KDMs, while imperfect, are moderately accurate methods for determining the distance to NGC objects in the plane of the Milky Way.
#### Fermi-LAT detection of A new starburst galaxy candidate: IRAS 13052-5711

 - **Abstract**
 A likely starburst galaxy (SBG), IRAS 13052-5711, which is the most distant SBG candidate discovered to date, was found by analyzing 14.4 years of data from the Fermi large-area telescope (Fermi-LAT). This SBG's significance level is approximately 6.55$\sigma$ in the 0.1-500 GeV band. Its spatial position is close to that of 4FGL J1308.9-5730, determined from the Fermi large telescope fourth-source Catalog (4FGL). Its power-law spectral index is approximately 2.1, and its light curve (LC) for 14.4 years has no significant variability. These characteristics are highly similar to those of SBGs found in the past. We calculate the SBG's star formation rate (SFR) to be 29.38 $\rm M_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}$, which is within the SFR range of SBGs found to date. Therefore, IRAS 13052-5711 is considered to be a likely SBG. In addition, its 0.1-500 GeV luminosity is (3.28 $\pm$ 0.67) $\times 10^{42}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1}$, which deviates from the empirical relationship of the $\gamma$-ray luminosity and the total infrared luminosity. We considered a hadronic model to explain the GeV spectrum of IRAS 13052-5711.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments have reported strong evidence of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). If interpreted as primordial gravitational waves (GWs), the signal favors a strongly blue-tilted spectrum. Consequently, the nonsingular cosmology, which is able to predict a strongly blue-tilted GW spectrum with $n_T \simeq 2$ on certain scales, offers a potential explanation for the observed SGWB signal. In this paper, we present a Genesis-inflation model capable of explaining the SGWB signal observed by the PTA collaborations while also overcoming the initial singularity problem associated with the inflationary cosmology. Furthermore, our model predicts distinctive features in the SGWB spectrum, which might be examined by forthcoming space-based gravitational wave experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 The launch of NASA's Kepler space telescope in 2009 revolutionized the quality and quantity of observational data available for asteroseismic analysis. While Kepler was able to detect solar-like oscillations in hundreds of main-sequence and subgiant stars, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is now making similar observations for thousands of the brightest stars in the sky. The Asteroseismic Modeling Portal (AMP) is an automated and objective stellar model-fitting pipeline for asteroseismic data, which was originally developed to use models from the Aarhus Stellar Evolution Code (ASTEC). We briefly summarize an updated version of the AMP pipeline that uses Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), and we present initial modeling results for the Sun and several solar analogs to validate the precision and accuracy of the inferred stellar properties.

The combined effect of various physical and chemical processes over billions of years have resulted in a variety of planetary atmospheres across the Solar System. This paper performs a comparative study of planetary atmospheres and their engineering implications for future entry and aerocapture missions. The thick Venusian atmosphere results in high deceleration and heating rates and presents a demanding environment for both atmospheric entry and aerocapture. The thin Martian atmosphere allows low aerodynamic heating, but itself is not enough to decelerate a lander to sufficiently low speeds for a soft landing. With their enormous gravity wells, Jupiter and Saturn entry result in very high entry speeds, deceleration, and heating making them the most demanding destinations for atmospheric entry and impractical for aerocapture. Titan is a unique destination, with its low gravity and greatly extended thick atmosphere enabling low deceleration and heating loads for entry and aerocapture. Uranus and Neptune also have large gravity wells, resulting in high entry speeds, high deceleration and heating compared to the inner planets, but are still less demanding than Jupiter or Saturn.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a common unifying macroscopic framework for precursors in relativistic shock waves. These precursors transfer energy and momentum from the hot downstream to the cold upstream, modifying the shock structure. Derishev & Piran (2016} have shown that in a steady state, there is a maximal fraction of the downstream energy flux that the precursor can carry. We show that at this critical value, the shock disappears, and the flow passes through a sonic point. This behavior resembles the classical Newtonian Rayleigh flow problem. At the critical value, the transition is unstable as perturbations in the upstream accumulate at the sonic point. Thus, if such a point is reached, the shock structure is drastically modified, and the flow becomes turbulent.

 - **Abstract**
 Probability distributions become non-Gaussian when the flat $\Lambda$CDM model is fitted to redshift binned data in the late Universe. We explain mathematically why this non-Gaussianity arises and confirm that Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) marginalisation leads to biased inferences in observational Hubble data (OHD). In particular, in high redshift bins we find that $\chi^2$ minima, as identified from both least squares fitting and the MCMC chain, fall outside of the $1 \sigma$ confidence intervals. We resort to profile distributions to correct this bias. Doing so, we observe that $z \gtrsim 1$ cosmic chronometer (CC) data currently prefers a non-evolving (constant) Hubble parameter over a Planck-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology at $\sim 2 \sigma$. We confirm that both mock simulations and profile distributions agree on this significance. Moreover, on the assumption that the Planck-$\Lambda$CDM cosmological model is correct, using profile distributions we confirm a $> 2 \sigma$ discrepancy with Planck-$\Lambda$CDM in a combination of CC and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data beyond $ z \sim 1.5$ that was noted earlier through comparison of least square fits of observed and mock data.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) High-mass star formation is far less understood than low-mass star formation. It entails molecular outflows, which disturb the protostellar clump. Studying these outflows and the shocked gas they cause is key for a better understanding of this process. This study aims to characterise the behaviour of molecular outflows in the most massive protostellar sources in the Southern Galaxy by looking for evolutionary trends and associating shocked gas with outflow activity. We present APEX SEPIA180 observations (beamwidth $\sim$36") of SiO outflow candidates of a sample of 32 luminous and dense clumps, candidates to harbouring Hot Molecular Cores. We study the SiO(4-3) line emission, an unambiguous tracer of shocked gas and recent outflow activity, the HCO$^+$(2-1) and H$^{13}$CO$^+$(2-1) lines. 78% of our sample present SiO emission. Nine of these also have wings in the HCO$^+$ line, indicating outflow activity. The SiO emission of these 9 sources is more intense and wider than the rest, suggesting that the outflows in this group are faster and more energetic. Three positive correlations between the outflow properties were found, which suggest that more energetic outflows bear to mobilise more material. No correlation was found between the evolutionary stage indicator $L/M$ and SiO outflow properties, supporting that outflows happen throughout the whole high-mass star formation process. We conclude that sources with both SiO emission and HCO$^+$ wings and sources with only SiO emission are in virtually the same advanced stage of evolution in the high-mass star formation process. The former present more massive and more powerful SiO outflows than the latter. Thus, looking for more outflow signatures such as HCO$^+$ wings could help identify more massive and active massive star-forming regions in samples of similarly evolved sources, as well as sources with older outflow activity.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyzed four epochs of beamformed EVN data of the Crab Pulsar at 1658.49 MHz. With the high sensitivity resulting from resolving out the Crab Nebula, we are able to detect even the faint high-frequency components in the folded profile. We also detect a total of 65951 giant pulses, which we use to investigate the rates, fluence, phase, and arrival time distributions. We find that for the main pulse component, our giant pulses represent about 80% of the total flux. This suggests we have a nearly complete giant pulse energy distribution, although it is not obvious how the observed distribution could be extended to cover the remaining 20% of the flux without invoking large numbers of faint bursts for every rotation. Looking at the difference in arrival time between subsequent bursts in single rotations, we confirm that the likelihood of finding giant pulses close to each other is increased beyond that expected for randomly occurring bursts - some giant pulses consist of causally related microbursts, with typical separations of $\sim\!30{\rm\;\mu s}$ - but also find evidence that at separations $\gtrsim\!100{\rm\;\mu s}$ the likelihood of finding another giant pulse is suppressed. In addition, our high sensitivity enabled us to detect weak echo features in the brightest pulses (at $\sim\!0.4\%$ of the peak giant pulse flux), which are delayed by up to $\sim\!300{\rm\;\mu s}$.

 - **Abstract**
 IceCube DeepCore is an extension of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory designed to measure GeV scale atmospheric neutrino interactions for the purpose of neutrino oscillation studies. Distinguishing muon neutrinos from other flavors and reconstructing inelasticity are especially difficult tasks at GeV scale energies in IceCube DeepCore due to sparse instrumentation. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been found to have better success at neutrino event reconstruction than conventional likelihood-based methods. In this contribution, we present a new CNN model that exploits time and depth translational symmetry in IceCube DeepCore data and present the model's performance, specifically for flavor identification and inelasticity reconstruction.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the \textit{Gaia} DR3 RR Lyrae catalog, we use two methods to fit the density profiles with an improved broken power law, and find that there are two break radii coinciding with the two apocenter pile-ups of high-eccentricity Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger. Also, there is a break caused by the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream. Combining the positions of all breaks, we briefly analyze the metallicity and its dispersion as a function of $r$ as well as its distribution in cylindrical coordinates. For the clean sample, the $z\text{-to-}x$ ellipsoid axial ratio $q$ in $36\,{\rm kpc}\,\textless\,r\,\textless\,96\,{\rm kpc}$ becomes much smaller than that of the inner halo $(r\,\textless\,36\,{\rm kpc})$, while the major axis has a large uncertainty in the region of $36-66\,{\rm kpc}$ and the one in the region of $66-96\,{\rm kpc}$ is obviously different from that dominated by the Hercules-Aquila Cloud (HAC) and the Virgo Overdensity (VOD) in the inner halo, which indicates that there is an over-density structure distributed at low zenithal angles. Finally, we found that the over-density structure in the outer halo ($r\,\textgreater\,50\,{\rm kpc}$) is shell-shaped and relatively metal-rich compared to the outer background halo. We conclude that the shells could be the apocenter pile-ups of the high-eccentricity GSE merger, which is supported by previous numerical simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Validating the accelerating expansion of the universe is an important issue for understanding the evolution of the universe. By constraining the cosmic acceleration parameter $X_H$, we can discriminate between the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ (cosmological constant plus cold dark matter) model and LTB (the Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi) model. In this paper, we explore the possibility of constraining the cosmic acceleration parameter with the inspiral gravitational waveform of neutron star binaries (NSBs) in the frequency range of 0.1Hz-10Hz, which can be detected by the second-generation space-based gravitational wave detector DECIGO. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN), a long short-term memory (LSTM) network combined with a gated recurrent unit (GRU), and Fisher information matrix to derive constraints on the cosmic acceleration parameter $X_H$. Based on the simulated gravitational wave data with a time duration of 1 month, we conclude that CNN can limit the relative error to 14.09%, while LSTM network combined with GRU can limit the relative error to 13.53%. Additionally, using Fisher information matrix for gravitational wave data with a 5-year observation can limit the relative error to 32.94%. Compared with the Fisher information matrix method, deep learning techniques will significantly improve the constraints on the cosmic acceleration parameters at different redshifts. Therefore, DECIGO is expected to provide direct measurements of the acceleration of the universe, by observing the chirp signals of coalescing binary neutron stars.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present a cosmology-independent method to constrain cosmological models from the latest 221 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) sample, including 49 GRBs from Fermi catalog with the Amati relation (the $E_{\rm p}$-${E}_{\rm iso}$ correlation), which calibrated by using a Gaussian process from the Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) sample. With 182 GRBs at $0.8\le z\le8.2$ in the Hubble diagram and the latest observational Hubble data (OHD) by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, we obtained $\Omega_{\rm m}$ = $0.348^{+0.048}_{-0.066}$ and $h$ = $0.680^{+0.029}_{-0.029}$ for the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ = $0.318^{+0.067}_{-0.059}$, $h$ = $0.704^{+0.055}_{-0.068}$, $w$ = $-1.21^{+0.32}_{-0.67}$ for the flat $w$CDM model. These results are consistent with those in which the coefficients of the Amati relation and the cosmological parameters fitted simultaneously.

 - **Abstract**
 Phenomenological models are widely used in cosmology in relation to constraining different cosmological models, with two common examples being cosmographic expansions and modeling the equation-of-state parameter of dark energy. This work presents a study of how using different phenomenological expressions for observables and physical quantities versus using physically motivated, derived expressions affects cosmological parameter constraints. The study includes the redshift-distance relation and Hubble parameter as observables, and the dark energy equation-of-state parameter as a physical quantity, and focuses on constraining the cosmological parameter $\Omega_{\Lambda}$. The observables and equation-of-state parameter are all modeled both using the physical, derived expressions and a variety of phenomenological models with different levels of accuracy and complexity. The results suggest that the complexity of phenomenological expressions only has minor impact on the parameter constraints unless the complexity is very high. The results also indicate that statistically significantly different results can be expected from parameter constraints using different phenomenological models if the models do not have very similar accuracy. This suggests that a good practice is to use multiple phenomenological models when possible, in order to assess the model dependence of results. Straightforward examples of this is that results obtained using cosmographic expansions should always be checked against similar results obtained with expansions of other order, and when using phenomenological models such as for the equation-of-state parameters, robustness of results could be assessed using fitted models from symbolic regression, similar to what is done in this study.
#### On the 'Loose' Constraint from IceCube Neutrino Non-Detection of GRB  230307A

 - **Abstract**
 The recent extremely bright GRB 230307A from a binary neutron star merger may offer a good probe for the production of GRB-neutrinos. Within the constraint from IceCube neutrino non-detection, the limitations for key physical parameters of this burst are extracted in different scenarios including the fireball, Poynting-flux-dominated (PFD) and hybrid jet. Different from the former nearby `monsters' and due to its smaller isotropic equivalent radiated energy ($E_{\gamma,\rm iso}\sim4\times10^{52}$ erg), the constraint seems loose if non-thermal neutrinos produced from photomeson interactions are the only consideration. However, a quasi-thermal neutrino emission from hadronuclear processes is constrained in this neutron-rich post-merger environment, and the upper limit of the allowed nucleon loading factor is about a few. Based on this, a discussion is presented on the possible prompt emission mechanism and jet composition for GRB 230307A in the context of multi-messenger astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 In this population synthesis work we study a variety of possible origin channels of supernovae type Ia (SNe Ia) Among them mergers of carbon-oxygen (CO) and oxygen-neon (ONe) white dwarfs (WDs) under the influence of gravitational waves are considered as the primary channel of SNe Ia formation. We estimated frequencies of mergers of WDs with different chemical compositions and distributions of masses of merging WDs. We computed the dependence of the ratio of merger frequencies of ONe and CO WDs as primaries in corresponding binaries on time. The scatter of masses of considered sources (up to the factor $1.5-2$) of SNe Ia is important and should be carefully studied with other sophisticated methods from theoretical point of view. Our ``game of parameters'' potentially explains the increased dimming of SNe Ia in the redshift range $z\approx 0.5-1$ by the changes in the ratio of ONe and CO WDs, i.e., to describe the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe in terms of the evolution of properties of SNe Ia instead of cosmological explanations. This example shows the extreme importance of theoretical studies of problems concerning SNe Ia, because evolutionary scenario and parameter games in nature potentially lead to confusions in their empirical standardization and, therefore, they can influence on cosmological conclusions.
#### Correlation between the optical veiling and accretion properties: A case  study of the classical T Tauri star DK Tau

 - **Abstract**
 Classical T Tauri stars (cTTs) accrete from their circumstellar disk. The material falls onto the stellar surface, producing an accretion shock, which generates veiling in a star's spectra. In addition, the shock causes a localized accretion spot at the level of the chromosphere. Our goal is to investigate the accretion, particularly the mass accretion rates (Macc), for the cTTs DK Tau, over two periods of 17 and 29 days, using two different procedures for comparison purposes. The first method relies on the derivation of the accretion luminosity via accretion-powered emission lines. The second compares the variability of the optical veiling with accretion shock models to determine mass accretion rates. We used observations taken in 2010 and 2012 with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at the CFHT. We find peak values of the veiling (at 550 nm) ranging from 0.2 to 1.3, with a steeper trend across the wavelength range for higher peak values. When using the accretion-powered emission lines, we find mass accretion rate values ranging from log(Macc[Msol/yr]) = -8.20 to log(Macc[Msol/yr]) = -7.40. This agrees with the values found in the literature, as well as the values calculated using the accretion shock models and the veiling. In addition, we identify a power-law correlation between the values of the accretion luminosity and the optical veiling. For the 2010 observations, using the values of the filling factors (which represent the area of the star covered by an accretion spot) derived from the shock models, we infer that the accretion spot was located between +45 degrees and +75 degrees in latitude. We show that both methods of determining the mass accretion rate yield similar results. We also present a helpful means of confirming the accretion luminosity values by measuring the veiling at a single wavelength in the optical.

 The accretion flow / jet correlation in neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) is far less understood when compared to black hole (BH) LMXBs. In this paper we will present the results of a dense multi-wavelength observational campaign on the NS LMXB 4U 1820-30, including X-ray (Nicer, NuSTAR and AstroSAT) and quasi-simultaneous radio (ATCA) observations in 2022. 4U 1820-30 shows a peculiar 170 day super-orbital accretion modulation, during which the system evolves between "modes" of high and low X-ray flux. During our monitoring, the source did not show any transition to a full hard state. X-ray spectra were well described using a disc blackbody, a Comptonisation spectrum along with a Fe K emission line at 6.6 keV. Our results show that the observed X-ray flux modulation is almost entirely produced by changes in the size of the region providing seed photons for the Comptonisation spectrum. This region is large (about 15 km) in the high mode and likely coincides with the whole boundary layer, while it shrinks significantly (<10 km) in low mode. The electron temperature of the corona and the observed RMS variability in the hard X-rays also exhibit a slight increase in low mode. As the source moves from high to low mode, the radio emission due to the jet becomes about 5 fainter. These radio changes appear not to be strongly connected to the hard-to-soft transitions as in BH systems, while they seem to be connected mostly to variations observed in the boundary layer.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars are products of a poorly understood binary interaction process that occurs during the AGB phase. These systems comprise of a post-AGB primary star, a main-sequence secondary companion and a stable circumbinary disc. Studying the structure and properties of these circumbinary discs is crucial for gaining insight into the binary interaction process that governs post-AGB binaries as well as comprehending the disc's creation, evolution, and its interaction with the post-AGB binary system. We aim to use near-infrared polarimetric imaging to investigate the morphology and potential substructures of circumbinary discs around eight representative post-AGB binary stars. To achieve this, we performed polarimetric differential imaging in H and Y bands using the high-angular resolution capabilities of the European Southern Observatory-Very Large Telescope/SPHERE-Infra-Red Dual-beam Imaging and Spectroscopy instrument. We resolved the extended circumbinary disc structure for a diverse sample of eight post-AGB binary systems. Our analysis provided the first estimates of the disc scale-height for two of the systems: IW Car and IRAS 15469-5311. We also investigated the morphological differences between the full discs (with the inner rim at the dust sublimation radius) and transition discs (which are expected to have larger inner cavities), as well as similarities to protoplanetary disks around young stellar objects. We found that the transition discs displayed a more intricate and asymmetric configuration. Surprisingly, no correlation was found between the over-resolved flux in near-IR interferometric data and the polarimetric observations, suggesting that scattering of light on the disc surface may not be the primary cause of the observed over-resolved flux component.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of X-ray pulsar 4U 1626-67 during its current spin-down (2SD) state, following a recent torque reversal. Since its discovery, this ultra-compact binary has experienced multiple torque states, transitioning from spin-up (1SU) during 1977-1990 to spin-down (1SD) during 1990-2008, and again spin-up (2SU) until 2023. From NuSTAR observation of May 2023, we have investigated the timing and spectral properties of this pulsar during its 2SD phase, while also comparing them with previous spin-up-down states. For energies upto 8 keV, a distinct bi-horned pulse profile was observed during the spin-up phase, while several sub-structures emerged during spin-down. Beyond 8 keV, a broad asymmetric peak was consistently observed across all torque states. The pulse fraction during the 2SD phase was higher than that during 2SU phase. A prominent ~46.8 mHz quasi-periodic oscillation has been exclusively detected during the spin-down phase. The broadband spectrum during the 2SD phase is described by empirical NPEX model, cyclotron absorption feature and its first harmonic. The spectrum during 2SU phase requires an additional blackbody component and asymmetry in the cyclotron absorption line. A significant flux drop by a factor of ~3 in the 2SD was observed.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent Gaia third data release (DR3) has brought some new exciting data about stellar binaries. It provides new opportunities to fully characterize more stellar systems and contribute to enforce our global knowledge of stars behaviour. By combining the new Gaia non-single stars catalog with double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2), one can determine the individual masses and luminosities of the components. To fit an empirical mass-luminosity relation in the Gaia G band, lower mass stars need to be added. Those can be derived using Gaia resolved wide binaries combined with literature data. Using the BINARYS tool, we combine the astrometric non-single star solutions in the Gaia DR3 with SB2 data from two other catalogs : the 9th Catalogue of Spectroscopic Binary orbits (SB9) and APOGEE. We also look for low mass stars resolved in Gaia with direct imaging and Hipparcos data or literature mass fraction. The combination of Gaia astrometric non-single star solutions with double-lined spectroscopic data enabled to characterize 43 binary systems with SB9 and 13 with APOGEE. We further derive the masses of 6 low mass binaries resolved with Gaia. We then derive an empirical mass-luminosity relation in the Gaia G band down to 0.12 Msun.

 - **Abstract**
 The understanding of planet formation has changed recently, embracing the new idea of pebble accretion. This means that the influx of pebbles from the outer regions of planet-forming disks to their inner zones could determine the composition of planets and their atmospheres. The solid and molecular components delivered to the planet-forming region can be best characterized by mid-infrared spectroscopy. With Spitzer low-resolution (R=100, 600) spectroscopy, this approach was limited to the detection of abundant molecules such as H2O, C2H2, HCN and CO2. This contribution will present first results of the MINDS (MIRI mid-IR Disk Survey, PI: Th. Henning) project. Due do the sensitivity and spectral resolution (R~1500-3500) provided by JWST we now have a unique tool to obtain the full inventory of chemistry in the inner disks of solar-types stars and brown dwarfs, including also less abundant hydrocarbons and isotopologues. The Integral Field Unit (IFU) capabilities enable at the same time spatial studies of the continuum and line emission in extended sources such as debris disks, the flying saucer and also the search for mid-IR signatures of forming planets in systems such as PDS70. These JWST observations are complementary to ALMA and NOEMA observations of the outer disk chemistry; together these datasets provide an integral view of the processes occurring during the planet formation phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution transmission spectroscopy of WASP-76b with GRACES/Gemini North obtained as part of the ExoGemS survey. With a broad spectral range of 400-1050 nm and a relatively high resolution of ~66,000, these observations are particularly well-suited to searching for atomic and molecular atmospheric species via the Doppler cross-correlation technique. We recover absorption features due to neutral iron (Fe I), sodium (Na I), and ionized calcium (Ca II) at high significance (>5$\sigma$), and investigate possible atmospheric temperatures and wind speeds. We also report tentative (>3$\sigma$) detections of Li I, K I, Cr I, and V I in the atmosphere of WASP-76b. Finally, we report non-detections of a number of other species, some of which have previously been detected with other instruments. Through model injection/recovery tests, we demonstrate that many of these species are not expected to be detected in our observations. These results allow us to place GRACES and the ExoGemS survey in context with other high-resolution optical spectrographs.

 - **Abstract**
 With the successful impact of the NASA DART spacecraft in the Didymos-Dimorphos binary asteroid system, we provide an initial analysis of the post-impact perturbed binary asteroid dynamics. To compare our simulation results with observations, we introduce a set of "observable elements" calculated using only the physical separation of the binary asteroid, rather than traditional Keplerian elements. Using numerical methods that treat the fully spin-orbit-coupled dynamics, we estimate the system's mass and the impact-induced changes in orbital velocity, semimajor axis, and eccentricity. We find that the changes to the mutual orbit depend strongly on the separation distance between Didymos and Dimorphos at the time of impact. If Dimorphos enters a tumbling state after the impact, this may be observable through changes in the system's eccentricity and orbit period. We also find that any DART-induced reshaping of Dimorphos would generally reduce the required change in orbital velocity to achieve the measured post-impact orbit period and will be assessed by the ESA Hera mission in 2027.

 - **Abstract**
 In active galactic nuclei, the relationship between UV and X-ray luminosity is well studied (often characterised by $\alpha_\text{ox}$) but often with heterogeneous samples. We have parametrized the intrinsic distribution of X-ray luminosity, $L_\text{X}$, for the optically-selected sample of SDSS quasars in the Stripe 82 and XXL fields across redshifts 0.5-3.5. We make use of the available XMM observations and a custom pipeline to produce Bayesian sensitivity curves that are used to derive the intrinsic X-ray distribution in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We find that the X-ray luminosity distribution is well described by a Gaussian function in ${\log_{10}}L_\text{X}$ space with a mean that is dependent on the monochromatic 2500A UV luminosity, $L_{2500}$. We also observe some redshift dependence of the distribution. The mean of the $L_\text{X}$ distribution increases with redshift while the width decreases. This weak but significant redshift dependence leads to $L_{2500}$-$L_\text{X}$ and $L_{2500}$-$\alpha_\text{ox}$ relations that evolve with redshift, and we produce a redshift- and $L_{2500}$-dependent $\alpha_\text{ox}$ equation. The increasing average black hole mass with redshift in our sample points to black hole mass as a potential driver of the redshift evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Star ADS 9173=WDS 14135+5147=Hip 69483 is a complex system. The B component has a spectroscopic companion, whose orbit with a period of 4.9 years has been known since 1986. The Gaia telescope has detected a distant faint pair over 100 arcsec away from the bright AB pair. In our article, we study the movement in a bright pair based on long-term observations with the 26-inch refractor of the Pulkovo Observatory. The AB pair orbit with a period of 6306 years was calculated using the apparent motion parameters (AMP) method. The astrometric orbit of the component B was determined on the basis of the residuals of the homogeneous CCD observations up to 2023 with the 26-inch refractor. It is in agreement with the spectroscopic one. The remaining secondary residuals show a wave with a period of approximately 20 years, the reasons for which are discussed.
#### The Rapid Imaging Planetary Spectrograph

 - **Abstract**
 The Rapid Imaging Planetary Spectrograph (RIPS) was designed as a long-slit high-resolution spectrograph for the specific application of studying atmospheres of spatially extended solar system bodies. With heritage in terrestrial airglow instruments, RIPS uses an echelle grating and order-sorting filters to obtain optical spectra at resolving powers up to R~127,000. An ultra-narrowband image from the reflective slit jaws is captured concurrently with each spectrum on the same EMCCD detector. The "rapid" portion of RIPS' moniker stems from its ability to capture high frame rate data streams, which enables the established technique known as "lucky imaging" to be extended to spatially resolved spectroscopy. Resonantly scattered emission lines of alkali metals, in particular, are sufficiently bright to be measured in short integration times. RIPS has mapped the distributions of Na and K emissions in Mercury's tenuous exosphere, which exhibit dynamic behavior coupled to the planet's plasma and meteoroid environment. An important application is daylight observations of Mercury at solar telescopes since synoptic context on the exosphere's distribution comprises valuable ground-based support for the upcoming BepiColombo orbital mission. As a conventional long slit spectrograph, RIPS has targeted the Moon's surface-bound exosphere where structure in linewidth and brightness as a function of tangent altitude are observed. At the Galilean moons, RIPS can study the plasma interaction with Io and place new constraints on the sputtered atmosphere of Europa, which in turn provides insight into the salinity of Europa's subsurface ocean. The instrumental design and construction are described herein, and these astronomical observations are presented to illustrate RIPS' performance as a visiting instrument at three different telescope facilities.
