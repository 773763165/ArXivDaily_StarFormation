          Noise Models in the LISA Mission

 - **Abstract**
 This document briefly describes the noise models and shapes used for the synthesis of the Drag-Free and Attitude Control System in the LISA space mission. LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) is one of the next large-class missions from the European Space Agency (ESA), expected to be launched in 2034. The main goal of the mission is to detect the gravitational waves, which are undulatory perturbations of the space-time fabric, extremely important to collect experimental proofs for the General Relativity Theory. In the 90s, different international collaborations of institutes laid the foundations for the first ground-based interferometers (see, e.g., LIGO and Virgo). However, ground-based interferometers have a limited bandwidth due to the Earth's environmental noises and short arm-length of few kilometers. Therefore, they cannot observe gravitational waves belonging to the portion of the spectrum below 1 Hz. This issue can be overcome by means of space-based interferometers, that can have arm-lengths up to millions of kilometers and exploit a quieter environment than the Earth's surface. The LISA system is affected by actuation, sensing and environmental disturbances and noises. Among the actuation noises we have those given by the Micro Propulsion System (MPS), the Gravitational Reference Sensor (GRS) and the Optical Assembly (OA) motor. Among the sensing noises we consider the interferometer, the Differential Wavefront Sensor (DWS) and the GRS. The environmental disturbances are given by the solar radiation pressure, the test-mass stiffness and self-gravity, and the environmental noises acting directly on the test-mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark kinetic heating of neutron stars has been previously studied as a promising dark matter detection avenue. Kinetic heating occurs when dark matter is sped up to relativistic speeds in the gravitational well of high-escape velocity objects, and deposits kinetic energy after becoming captured by the object, thereby increasing its temperature. We show that dark kinetic heating can be significant even in objects with low-escape velocities, such as exoplanets and brown dwarfs, increasing the discovery potential of such searches. This can occur if there is a long-range dark force, creating a "dark escape velocity", leading to heating rates substantially larger than those expected from neutron stars. We consequently set constraints on dark sector parameters using Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and JWST data on Super-Jupiter WISE 0855-0714, and map out future sensitivity to the dark matter scattering cross section below $10^{-40}~{\rm cm}^2$. We compare dark kinetic heating rates of other lower escape velocity objects such as the Earth, Sun, and white dwarfs, finding complementary kinetic heating signals are possible depending on particle physics parameters.

          The hydrodynamic response of small-scale structure to reionization drives large IGM temperature fluctuations that persist to z = 4

 - **Abstract**
 The thermal history and structure of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at $z \geq 4$ is a key boundary condition for reionization, which has been measured using the Ly$\alpha$ forest of high-redshift quasars. It is also a key input for studies that use the forest to constrain the particle masses of alternative dark matter candidates. Most such inferences rely on simulations that lack the spatial resolution to fully resolve the hydrodynamic response of IGM filaments and minihalos caused by HI reionization heating. In this letter, we use high-resolution hydrodynamic+radiative transfer simulations to study the impact of these on the IGM thermal structure. We find that the adiabatic heating and cooling driven by the expansion of initially cold gas filaments and minihalos drives significant temperature fluctuations on small scales. These likely persist in much of the IGM until at least $z = 4$. Capturing this effect requires resolving the characteristic clumping scale of cold, pre-ionized gas, which demands spatial resolutions of at least $2$ $h^{-1}$kpc. Pre-heating of the IGM by X-Ray sources can slightly reduce the effect. Our preliminary estimate of the effect on the Ly$\alpha$ forest finds that, at $\log(k /[{\rm km^{-1} s}]) = -1.0$, the forest flux power (at fixed mean flux) can increase by $10-20\%$ when going from $8$ and $2$ $h^{-1}$kpc resolution at $z = 4-5$ for gas ionized at $z < 7$. These findings motivate a more careful analysis of how temperature fluctuations driven by pressure smoothing from reionization affect the Ly$\alpha$ forest.

          The Implications of Thermal Hydrodynamic Atmospheric Escape on the TRAPPIST-1 Planets

 - **Abstract**
 JWST observations of the 7-planet TRAPPIST-1 system will provide an excellent opportunity to test outcomes of stellar-driven evolution of terrestrial planetary atmospheres, including atmospheric escape, ocean loss and abiotic oxygen production. While most previous studies use a single luminosity evolution for the host star, we incorporate observational uncertainties in stellar mass, luminosity evolution, system age, and planetary parameters to statistically explore the plausible range of planetary atmospheric escape outcomes. We present probabilistic distributions of total water loss and oxygen production as a function of initial water content, for planets with initially pure water atmospheres and no interior-atmosphere exchange. We find that the interior planets are desiccated for initial water contents below 50 Earth oceans. For TRAPPIST-1e, f, g, and h, we report maximum water loss ranges of 8.0$^{+1.3}_{-0.9}$, 4.8$^{+0.6}_{-0.4}$, 3.4$^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$, and 0.8$^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ Earth oceans, respectively, with corresponding maximum oxygen retention of 1290$^{+75}_{-75}$, 800$^{+40}_{-40}$, 560$^{+30}_{-25}$, and 90$^{+10}_{-10}$ bars. We explore statistical constraints on initial water content imposed by current water content, which could inform evolutionary history and planet formation. If TRAPPIST-1b is airless while TRAPPIST-1c possesses a tenuous oxygen atmosphere, as initial JWST observations suggest, then our models predict an initial surface water content of 8.2$^{+1.5}_{-1.0}$ Earth oceans for these worlds, leading to the outer planets retaining $>$1.5 Earth oceans after entering the habitable zone. Even if TRAPPIST-1c is airless, surface water on the outer planets would not be precluded.

          Exomoons & Exorings with the Habitable Worlds Observatory I: On the Detection of Earth-Moon Analog Shadows & Eclipses

 - **Abstract**
 The highest priority recommendation of the Astro2020 Decadal Survey for space-based astronomy was the construction of an observatory capable of characterizing habitable worlds. In this paper series we explore the detectability of and interference from exomoons and exorings serendipitously observed with the proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) as it seeks to characterize exoplanets, starting in this manuscript with Earth-Moon analog mutual events. Unlike transits, which only occur in systems viewed near edge-on, shadow (i.e., solar eclipse) and lunar eclipse mutual events occur in almost every star-planet-moon system. The cadence of these events can vary widely from ~yearly to multiple events per day, as was the case in our younger Earth-Moon system. Leveraging previous space-based (EPOXI) lightcurves of a Moon transit and performance predictions from the LUVOIR-B concept, we derive the detectability of Moon analogs with HWO. We determine that Earth-Moon analogs are detectable with observation of ~2-20 mutual events for systems within 10pc, and larger moons should remain detectable out to 20pc. We explore the extent to which exomoon mutual events can mimic planet features and weather. We find that HWO wavelength coverage in the near-IR, specifically in the 1.4 micron water band where large moons can outshine their host planet, will aid in differentiating exomoon signals from exoplanet variability. Finally, we predict that exomoons formed through collision processes akin to our Moon are more likely to be detected in younger systems, where shorter orbital periods and favorable geometry enhance the probability and frequency of mutual events.

          A Test of Spectroscopic Age Estimates of White Dwarfs using Wide WD+WD Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarf stars have been used for decades as precise and accurate age indicators. This work presents a test of the reliability of white dwarf total ages when spectroscopic observations are available. We conduct follow-up spectroscopy of 148 individual white dwarfs in widely separated double-white-dwarf (WD+WD) binaries. We supplement the sample with 264 previously published white dwarf spectra, as well as 1292 high-confidence white dwarf spectral types inferred from their Gaia XP spectra. We find that spectroscopic fits to optical spectra do not provide noticeable improvement to the age agreement among white dwarfs in wide WD+WD binaries. The median age agreement is $\approx$$1.5\sigma$ for both photometrically and spectroscopically determined total ages, for pairs of white dwarfs with each having a total age uncertaintiy $<$ 20\%. For DA white dwarfs, we further find that photometrically determined atmospheric parameters from spectral energy distribution fitting give better total age agreement ($1.0\sigma$, 0.2 Gyr, or 14\% of the binary's average total age) compared to spectroscopically determined parameters from Balmer-line fits (agreement of $1.5\sigma$, 0.3 Gyr, or 28\% of binary's average total age). We find further evidence of a significant merger fraction among wide WD+WD binaries: across multiple spectroscopically identified samples, roughly 20\% are inconsistent with a monotonically increasing initial-final mass relation. We recommend the acquisition of an identification spectrum to ensure the correct atmospheric models are used in photometric fits in order to determine the most accurate total age of a white dwarf star.

          MARTIANS (MARs2020, TIANwen and So on) would see more potentially hazardous asteroids than Earthlings

 - **Abstract**
 Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) are a special subset of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) that can come close to the Earth and are large enough to cause significant damage in the event of an impact. Observations and researches of Earth-PHAs have been underway for decades. Here, we extend the concept of PHAs to Mars and study the feasibility of detecting Mars-PHAs in the near future. We focus on PHAs that truly undergo close approaches with a planet (dubbed CAPHAs) and aim to compare the actual quantities of Earth-CAPHAs and Mars-CAPHAs by conducting numerical simulations incorporating the Yarkovsky effect, based on observed data of the main asteroid belt. The estimated number of Earth-CAPHAs and Mars-CAPHAs are 4675 and 16910, respectively. The occurrence frequency of Mars-CAPHAs is about 52 per year, which is 2.6 times that of Earth-CAPHAs, indicating significant potential for future Mars-based observations. Furthermore, a few Mars-CAPHAs are predicted to be observable even from Earth around the time of next Mars opposition in 2025.

          Information content of JWST spectra of WASP-39b

 - **Abstract**
 WASP-39b was observed using several different JWST instrument modes and the spectra were published in a series of papers by the ERS team. The current study examines the information content of these spectra measured using the different instrument modes, focusing on the complexity of the temperature-pressure profiles and number of chemical species warranted by the data. We examine if H2O, CO, CO2, K, H2S, CH4, and SO2 are detected in each of the instrument modes. Two Bayesian inference methods are used to perform atmospheric retrievals: standard nested sampling and supervised machine learning of the random forest (trained on a model grid). For nested sampling, Bayesian model comparison is used as a guide to identify the set of models with the required complexity to explain the data. Generally, non-isothermal transit chords are needed to fit the transmission spectra of WASP-39b, although the complexity of the Tp-profile required is mode-dependent. The minimal set of chemical species needed to fit a spectrum is mode-dependent as well, and also depends on whether grey or non-grey clouds are assumed. When a non-grey cloud model is used to fit the G395H spectrum, it generates a spectral continuum that compensates for the H2O opacity. The same compensation is absent when fitting the non-grey cloud model to the PRISM spectrum (which has broader wavelength coverage), suggesting that it is spurious. The interplay between the cloud spectral continuum and the H2O opacity determines if SO2 is needed to fit either spectrum. The inferred elemental abundances of carbon and oxygen and the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios are all mode- and model-dependent, and should be interpreted with caution. Bayesian model comparison does not always offer a clear path forward for favouring specific retrieval models (e.g. grey versus non-grey clouds) and thus for enabling unambiguous interpretations of exoplanet spectra.

          Modeling Hadronic Interactions in Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays within Astrophysical Environments: A Parametric Approach

 - **Abstract**
 Interactions of ultra-high energy cosmic-rays (UHECRs) accelerated in astrophysical environments have been shown to shape the energy production rate of nuclei escaping from the confinement zone. To address the influence of hadronic interactions, Hadronic Interaction Models (HIM) come into play. In this context, we present a parameterization capable of capturing the outcomes of two distinct HIMs, namely EPOS-LHC and Sibyll2.3d, in terms of secondary fluxes, including escaping nuclei, neutrinos, photons, and electrons. Our parametrization is systematically evaluated against the source codes, both at fixed energy and mass, as well as in a physical case scenario. The comparison demonstrates that our parameterization aligns well with the source codes, establishing its reliability as a viable alternative for analytical or fast Monte Carlo approaches dedicated to the study of UHECR propagation within source environments. This suggests the potential for utilizing our parameterization as a practical substitute in studies focused on the intricate dynamics of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.

          On the Impact of Dark Matter Scattering on the Trajectory of High-Energy Cosmic Rays

 - **Abstract**
 We study the impact on the trajectory of high-energy cosmic-ray protons of scattering off the cosmic dark matter. We compute the scattering angle as a function of the cosmic-ray energy, of the dark matter mass, and of the interaction strength for a few representative choices for the relevant interaction cross section. We find that the typical deflection angle over the cosmic ray path is largely independent of the dark matter mass. Given existing limits on the interaction strength, we compute the average deflection angle. We find that for large interaction cross sections and low cosmic ray energies, the predicted deflection angle is much larger than the angular resolution of very high-energy cosmic-ray observatories such as Pierre Auger.

          Solar Flare Ribbon Fronts. II. Evolution of heating rates in individual flare footpoints

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flare ribbon fronts appear ahead of the bright structures that normally characterise solar flares, and can persist for an extended period of time in spatially localised patches before transitioning to `regular' bright ribbons. They likely represent the initial onset of flare energy deposition into the chromosphere. Chromospheric spectra (e.g. He I 10830A and the Mg II near-UV lines) from ribbon fronts exhibit properties rather different to typical flare behaviour. In prior numerical modelling efforts we were unable to reproduce the long lifetime of ribbon fronts. Here we present a series of numerical experiments that are rather simple but which have important implications. We inject a very low flux of nonthermal electrons ($F = 5\times10^{8}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$) into the chromosphere for 100 s before ramping up to standard flare energy fluxes $(F = 10^{10-11}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$). Synthetic spectra not only sustained their ribbon front-like properties for significantly longer, in the case of harder nonthermal electron spectra the ribbon front behaviour persisted for the entirety of this weak-heating phase. Lengthening or shortening the duration of the weak-heating phase commensurately lengthened or shortened the ribbon front lifetimes. Ribbon fronts transitioned to regular bright ribbons when the upper chromosphere became sufficiently hot and dense, which happened faster for softer nonthermal electron spectra. Thus, the lifetime of flare ribbon fronts are a direct measure of the duration over which a relatively low flux of high energy electrons precipitates to the chromosphere prior to the bombardment of a much larger energy flux.

          Dark Energy predictions from GREA: Background and linear perturbation theory

 - **Abstract**
 General Relativistic Entropic Acceleration (GREA) theory provides a covariant formalism for out-of-equilibrium phenomena in GR, extending the Einstein equations with an entropic force that behaves like bulk viscosity with a negative effective pressure. In particular, the growth of entropy associated with the homogeneous causal horizon can explain the present acceleration of the Universe, without introducing a cosmological constant. The dynamics of the accelerated Universe is characterized by a single parameter $\alpha$, the ratio of the causal horizon to the curvature scale, which provides a unique history of the Universe distinguishable from that of LCDM. In particular, we explain the coincidence problem and the Hubble tension by shifting the coasting point to higher redshifts. All background observables are correlated among themselves due to their common dependence on $\alpha$. This scenario gives a specific evolution for the effective equation of state parameter, $w(a)$. Furthermore, we study the linear growth of matter perturbations in the context of a homogeneous expanding background driven by the entropy of the causal horizon. We find that the rate of growth of matter fluctuations in GREA slows down due to the accelerated expansion and alleviates the $\sigma_8$ tension of LCDM. We compute the growth function of matter fluctuations, the redshift space distortions in the galaxy correlation function, as well as the redshift evolution of the BAO scale, and find that the ISW effect is significantly larger than in LCDM. It is interesting to note that many of the tensions and anomalies of the standard model of cosmology are alleviated by the inclusion of this transient period of acceleration of the Universe based on known fundamental physics. In the near future we will be able to constrain this theory with present data from deep galaxy surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 A substantial fraction of stars can be found in wide binaries with projected separations between $\sim10^2$ and $10^5\,\rm AU$. In the standard lore of binary physics, these would evolve as effectively single stars that remotely orbit one another on stationary Keplerian ellipses. However, embedded in their Galactic environment their low binding energy makes them exceptionally prone to perturbations from the gravitational potential of the Milky Way and encounters with passing stars. Employing a fully relativistic $N$-body integration scheme, we study the impact of these perturbations on the orbital evolution of wide binaries along their trajectory through the Milky Way. Our analysis reveals that the torques exerted by the Galaxy can cause large-amplitude oscillations of the binary eccentricity to $1-e\lesssim10^{-8}$. As a consequence, the wide binary members pass close to each other at periapsis, which, depending on the type of binary, potentially leads to a mass transfer or collision of stars or to an inspiral and subsequent merger of compact remnants due to gravitational-wave radiation. Based on a simulation of $10^5$ wide binaries across the Galactic field, we find that this mechanism could significantly contribute to the rate of stellar collisions and binary black hole mergers as inferred from observations of Luminous Red Novae and gravitational-wave events by LIGO/Virgo/Kagra. We conclude that the dynamics of wide binaries, despite their large mean separation, can give rise to extreme interactions between stars and compact remnants.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for extraterrestrial intelligence is currently being pursued using multiple techniques and in different wavelength bands. Dyson spheres, megastructures that could be constructed by advanced civilizations to harness the radiation energy of their host stars, represent a potential technosignature, that in principle may be hiding in public data already collected as part of large astronomical surveys. In this study, we present a comprehensive search for partial Dyson spheres by analyzing optical and infrared observations from Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE. We develop a pipeline that employs multiple filters to identify potential candidates and reject interlopers in a sample of five million objects, which incorporates a convolutional neural network to help identify confusion in WISE data. Finally, the pipeline identifies 7 candidates deserving of further analysis. All of these objects are M-dwarfs, for which astrophysical phenomena cannot easily account for the observed infrared excess emission.

          Morphokinematical study of the planetary nebula Me2-1: Unveiling its point-symmetric and unusual physical structure

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) We present narrow-band images in several emission lines, and high- and intermediate-resolution long-slit spectra of Me2-1 to investigate its morphology and 3D structure, its physical parameters and chemical abundances. We identified in Me2-1: an elliptical ring; two elongated, curved structures (caps) that contain three pairs of bright point-symmetric (PS) knots; a shell interior of the ring; and a faint halo or attached shell. The caps are observed in all images, the PS knots only in the low-excitation emission line ones. These structures are also identified in the high-resolution long-slit spectra. The 3D reconstruction shows that Me2-1 consists of a ring seen almost pole-on, and a virtually spherical shell, to which the caps and PS knots are attached. Caps and PS knots most probably trace the sites where high-velocity collimated bipolar outflows, ejected along a wobbling axis, collide with the spherical shell, are slowed down, and remain attached to it. Although the main excitation mechanism in Me2-1 is found to be photoionization, a contribution of shocks in the PS knots is suggested by their emission line ratios. The combination of collimated outflows and a ring with a spherical shell is unusual among planetary nebulae. We speculate that two planets, each with less than one Jupiter mass, could be involved in the formation of Me2-1 if both enter a common envelope evolution during the asymptotic giant branch phase of the progenitor. One planet is tidally disrupted, forming an accretion disk around the central star, from which collimated bipolar outflows are ejected; the other planet survives, causing wobbling of the accretion disk. The derived physical parameters and chemical abundances are similar to those obtained in previous analyses, with the abundances also pointing to a low-mass progenitor of Me2-1.

 - **Abstract**
 Silk damping is well known in the study of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and accounts for suppression of the angular power spectrum of CMB on large angular multipoles. In this Letter, we study the effect of Silk damping on the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). Resulting from the dissipation of cosmic fluid, the Silk damping notably suppresses the energy-density spectrum of SIGWs on scales comparable to a diffusion scale at the decoupling time of feebly-interacting particles. The effect offers a novel observable for probing the underlying particle interaction, especially for those mediated by heavy gauge bosons beyond the standard model of particles. We anticipate that pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to gauge bosons with mass $\sim10^{3}-10^{4}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, while space- and ground-based interferometers to those with mass $\sim10^7-10^{12}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, leading to essential complements to on-going and future experiments of high-energy physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous observations of Phobos and Deimos, the moons of Mars, have improved our understanding of these small bodies. However, their formation and composition remain poorly constrained. Physical and spectral properties suggest that Phobos may be a weakly thermal-altered captured asteroid but the dynamical properties of the martian system suggest a formation by giant collision similar to the Earth moon. In 2027, the JAXA's MMX mission aims to address these outstanding questions. We undertook measurements with a new simulant called OPPS (Observatory of Paris Phobos Simulant) which closely matches Phobos spectra in the visible to the mid-infrared range. The simulant was synthesized using a mixture of olivine, saponite, anthracite, and coal. Since observation geometry is a crucial aspect of planetary surface remote sensing exploration, we evaluated the parameters obtained by modeling the phase curves -- obtained through laboratory measurements -- of two different Phobos simulants (UTPS-TB and OPPS) using Hapke IMSA model. Our results show that the photometric properties of Phobos simulants are not fully consistent with those of Tagish Lake, Allende, or the NWA 4766 shergottite. We also investigated the detection of volatiles/organic compounds and hydrated minerals, as the presence of such components is expected on Phobos in the hypothesis of a captured primitive asteroid. The results indicate that a significant amount of organic compounds is required for the detection of C-H bands at 3.4 $\mu$m. In contrast, the 2.7 $\mu$m absorption band, due to hydrated minerals, is much deeper and easier to detect than C-H organic features at the same concentration levels. Posing limits on detectability of some possible key components of Phobos surface will be pivotal to prepare and interpret future observations of the MIRS spectrometer onboard MMX mission.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the first data release from NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe's (WMAP) observations of the microwave sky, cleaned cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps thus derived were subjected to a variety of tests, to evaluate their conformity with expectations of the standard cosmological model. Specifically many peculiarities that have come to be called "anomalies" were reported that violate the \emph{Cosmological principle}. These were followed until the end of WMAP's final nine year data release and continued with the CMB maps derived from the recently concluded ESA's \textit{Planck} mission. One of the early topics of intense scrutiny is the alignment of multipoles corresponding to large angular scales of the CMB sky. In this paper, we revisit this particular anomaly and analyze this phenomenon across all data sets from WMAP and \textit{Planck} to gain a better understanding of its current status and import.

 - **Abstract**
 We present ALMA 12-m, 7-m & Total Power (TP) Array observations of the FU Orionis outbursting system, covering spatial scales ranging from 160 to 25,000 au. The high-resolution interferometric data reveals an elongated $^{12}$CO(2-1) feature previously observed at lower resolution in $^{12}$CO(3-2). Kinematic modeling indicates that this feature can be interpreted as an accretion streamer feeding the binary system. The mass infall rate provided by the streamer is significantly lower than the typical stellar accretion rates (even in quiescent states), suggesting that this streamer alone is not massive enough to sustain the enhanced accretion rates characteristic of the outbursting class prototype. The observed streamer may not be directly linked to the current outburst but rather a remnant of a previous, more massive streamer that may have contributed enough to the disk mass to render it unstable and trigger FU Ori's outburst. The new data detects, for the first time, a vast, slow-moving carbon monoxide molecular outflow emerging from this object. To accurately assess the outflow properties (mass, momentum, kinetic energy), we employed $^{13}$CO(2-1) data to correct for optical depth effects. The analysis indicates that the outflow corresponds to swept-up material not associated with the current outburst, similar to slow-molecular outflows observed around other FUor and Class I protostellar objects.

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of next-generation survey instruments, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and its Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), is opening a window for new research in time-domain astronomy. The Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC) was created to test the capacity of brokers to deal with a simulated LSST stream. We describe ATAT, the Astronomical Transformer for time series And Tabular data, a classification model conceived by the ALeRCE alert broker to classify light-curves from next-generation alert streams. ATAT was tested in production during the first round of the ELAsTiCC campaigns. ATAT consists of two Transformer models that encode light curves and features using novel time modulation and quantile feature tokenizer mechanisms, respectively. ATAT was trained on different combinations of light curves, metadata, and features calculated over the light curves. We compare ATAT against the current ALeRCE classifier, a Balanced Hierarchical Random Forest (BHRF) trained on human-engineered features derived from light curves and metadata. When trained on light curves and metadata, ATAT achieves a macro F1-score of 82.9 +- 0.4 in 20 classes, outperforming the BHRF model trained on 429 features, which achieves a macro F1-score of 79.4 +- 0.1. The use of Transformer multimodal architectures, combining light curves and tabular data, opens new possibilities for classifying alerts from a new generation of large etendue telescopes, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, in real-world brokering scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been suggested that relativistic jets might have been commonly formed in tidal disruption events (TDEs), but those with relatively weak power could be choked by the surrounding envelope. The discovery of high-energy neutrinos possibly associated with some normal TDEs may support this picture in the hypothesis that the neutrinos are produced by choked jets. Recently, it was noted that disrupted stars generally have misaligned orbits with respect to the supermassive black hole spin axis and highly misaligned precessing jets are more likely to be choked. Here we revisit the jet break-out condition for misaligned precessing jets by considering the jet could be collimated by the cocoon pressure while propagating in the disk wind envelope. The jet head opening angle decreases as the jet propagates in the envelope, but the minimum power of a successful jet remains unchanged in terms of the physical jet power. We further calculate the neutrino flux from choked precessing jets, assuming that the cocoon energy does not exceed the kinetic energy of the disk wind. We find that neutrino flux from highly misaligned choked jets is sufficient to explain the neutrinos from AT2019aalc, while it is marginal to explain the neutrinos from AT2019dsg and AT2019fdr. The latter could be produced by weakly misaligned choked jets, since the duty cycle that the jet sweeps across increases as the misaligned angle decreases. We also show that the population of choked TDE jets could contribute to ~10% of the observed diffuse neutrino flux measured by IceCube.

 - **Abstract**
 The ongoing debate regarding the most accurate accretion model for supermassive black holes at the center of quasars has remained a contentious issue in astrophysics. One significant challenge is the variation in calculated accretion efficiency, with values exceeding the standard range of $0.038 < \epsilon < 0.42$. This discrepancy is especially pronounced in high redshift supermassive black holes, necessitating the development of a comprehensive model that can address the accretion efficiency for supermassive black holes in both the low and high redshift ranges. In this study, we have focused on low redshift ($z < 0.5$) PG quasars (79 quasars) and high redshift ($z \geq 3$) quasars with standard disks from the flux- and volume-limited QUOTAS+QuasarNET dataset (76 quasars) to establish a model for accretion efficiency. An interesting trend is revealed where in redshift larger than 3, accretion efficiency increases as redshift decreases, while in redshift lower than 0.5, accretion efficiency decreases with reducing redshift. This suggests a peak in accretion efficiency between the low and high redshift quasars. This peak is recognized for the flux- and volume-limited QUOTAS+QuasarNET+DL11 dataset, which is $z \sim 2.675$, and it seems to be related to the peak of the star formation rate. ($1 < z_{SFR} < 3$). This result can potentially lead to a more accurate correlation between the star formation rate in quasars and their relationship with the mass of the central supermassive black holes with a more comprehensive disk model in future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio surveys of early-type stars have revealed a number of non-thermal emitters. Most of these have been shown to be binaries, where the collision between the two stellar winds is responsible for the non-thermal emission. HD 168112 is a non-thermal radio emitter, whose binary nature has only recently been confirmed spectroscopically. We obtained independent spectroscopic observations to determine its orbit, in addition to radio observations to see if the thermal or non-thermal nature of the emission changes during the periastron passage. We monitored HD 168112 spectroscopically for a 13 year time span. From these data, we determined the orbital parameters, which we compared to the previous results in the literature. From the spectral index of the radio observations, we found how the nature of the emission changes as the system goes through periastron. Combining our results with other literature data allowed us to further constrain the orbital and stellar parameters. We find HD 168112 to have an orbital period of P = 512.17+0.41-0.11 d, an eccentricity of e = 0.7533+0.0053-0.0124, and a mass ratio close to one. From our spectroscopic modelling, we derived the stellar parameters, but we had difficulty arriving at a spectroscopic mass ratio of one. The radio observations around periastron show only thermal emission, suggesting that most of the synchrotron photons are absorbed in the two stellar winds at that phase. Combining our data with the optical interferometry detection, we could constrain the inclination angle to i ~ 63 deg, and the mass of each component to ~ 26 Msun. We have provided an independent spectroscopic confirmation of the binary nature of HD 168112. Although detected as a non-thermal radio emitter, near periastron the radio emission of this highly eccentric system is thermal and is mainly formed in the colliding-wind region. [abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present a novel approach to accelerate the Bayesian inference process, focusing specifically on the nested sampling algorithms. Bayesian inference plays a crucial role in cosmological parameter estimation, providing a robust framework for extracting theoretical insights from observational data. However, its computational demands can be substantial, primarily due to the need for numerous likelihood function evaluations. Our proposed method utilizes the power of deep learning, employing feedforward neural networks to approximate the likelihood function dynamically during the Bayesian inference process. Unlike traditional approaches, our method trains neural networks on-the-fly using the current set of live points as training data, without the need for pre-training. This flexibility enables adaptation to various theoretical models and datasets. We perform simple hyperparameter optimization using genetic algorithms to suggest initial neural network architectures for learning each likelihood function. Once sufficient accuracy is achieved, the neural network replaces the original likelihood function. The implementation integrates with nested sampling algorithms and has been thoroughly evaluated using both simple cosmological dark energy models and diverse observational datasets. Additionally, we explore the potential of genetic algorithms for generating initial live points within nested sampling inference, opening up new avenues for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of Bayesian inference methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations recently reported evidence for the presence of a gravitational wave background (GWB) in their datasets. The main candidate that is expected to produce such a GWB is the population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB). Some analyses showed that the recovered signal may exhibit time-dependent properties, i.e. non-stationarity. In this paper, we propose an approximated non-stationary Gaussian process (GP) model obtained from the perturbation of stationary processes. The presented method is applied to the second data release of the European pulsar timing array to search for non-stationary features in the GWB. We analyzed the data in different time slices and showed that the inferred properties of the GWB evolve with time. We find no evidence for such non-stationary behavior and the Bayes factor in favor of the latter is $\mathcal{B}^{NS}_{S} = 1.5$. We argue that the evolution of the GWB properties most likely comes from the \mf{improvement of the observation cadence} with time and \mf{better} characterization of the noise of individual pulsars. Such non-stationary GWB could also be produced by the leakage of non-stationary features in the noise of individual pulsars or by the presence of an eccentric single source.

 We statistically evaluate and compare four orbital similarity criteria within five-dimensional parameter space ($D_{SH}$, $D_D$, $D_H$, and $\varrho_2$) to study dynamical associations using the already classified meteors (manually by a human) in CAMS database as a benchmark. In addition, we assess various distance metrics typically used in Machine Learning with two different vectors: ORBIT, grounded in heliocentric orbital elements, and GEO, predicated on geocentric observational parameters. Additionally, we compute the optimal cut-offs for all methods for distinguishing sporadic background events. Our findings demonstrate the superior performance of the sEuclidean metric in conjunction with the GEO vector. Within the scope of D-criteria, $D_{SH}$ emerged as the preeminent metric, closely followed by $\varrho_2$. $\varrho_2$ stands out as the most equivalence to the distance metrics when utilizing the GEO vector and the most compatible with GEO and ORBIT simultaneously, whereas $D_D$ aligns more closely when using the ORBIT vector. The stark contrast in $D_D$'s behavior compared to other D-criteria highlights potential inequivalence. Geocentric features provide a more robust basis than orbital elements for meteor dynamical association. Most distance metrics associated with the GEO vector surpass the D-criteria when differentiating the meteoroid background. Accuracy displayed a dependence on solar longitude with a pronounced decrease around 180$^\circ$ matching an apparent increase in the meteoroid background activity, tentatively associated with the transition from the Perseids to the Orionids. Considering lately identified meteor showers, $\sim$27\% of meteors in CAMS would have different associations. This work unveils that Machine Learning distance metrics can rival or even exceed the performance of tailored orbital similarity criteria for meteor dynamical association.

 - **Abstract**
 The problem of missing Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) refers to the issue that the currently known Galactic SNRs are significantly incomplete compared to the theoretical prediction. To expand the sample of Galactic SNRs, we use GLEAM and THOR+VGPS data across four wavebands ranging from 118 to 1420 MHz to drive a spectral index map covering the region within 26.6° < l < 30.6°, $\vert b \vert \leq$ 1.25°, where numerous SNR candidates were recently found. By using the spectral index map of the sky region and detailed analysis of the spectral indices of individual sources, we confirmed four SNR candidates, namely G26.75+0.73, G27.06+0.04, G28.36+0.21, and G28.78$-$0.44, as SNRs. Additionally, we discovered an expanding molecular superbubble located in this region, discussed pulsars associated with SNR candidates, and discovered a long H$\alpha$ filament that spatially overlaps with the candidate G29.38+0.10. We suggest that the problem of missing Galactic SNRs not only arises from observation limitations, but also could be due to the low-density environments of some SNRs, and the different SN explosion properties.

 - **Abstract**
 In very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) the combination of multiple antennas permits the synthesis of a virtual telescope with a larger diameter and consequently higher resolution than the individual antennae. Yet, due to the sparse nature of the array, recovering an image from the observed data is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem. The VLBI community is interested in not only recovering an image in total intensity from interferometric data, but also to obtain results in the polarimetric and the temporal domain. Only a few algorithms are able to work in all these domains simultaneously. In particular, the algorithms based on optimization that consider various penalty terms specific to static total intensity imaging, time-variability and polarimetry are restricted to grids the domain of the objective function. In this work we present a novel algorithm, multiobjective particle swarm optimization, that is able to recover the optimal weights without any space-gridding, and to obtain the marginal contribution of each the playing terms. To this end, we utilize multiobjective optimization together with particle swarm metaheuristics. We let the swarm of weights to converge together to the best position. We evaluate our algorithm with representative synthetic data sets focused on the instrumental configuration of the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration and its planned successors. We successfully recover the polarimetric, static and time-dynamic signature of the ground truth movie, even with relative sparsity, and a set of realistic data corruptions. This is a novel, fast, weighting space gridding-free algorithm that successfully recovers static and dynamic polarimetric reconstructions. Compared to Regularized Maximum Likelihood methods, it avoids the need for parameter surveys, and it is not limited to the number of pixels such as recently proposed multiobjective imaging algorithms.

 In this work, we investigate a minimalist model capable of accurately replicating the forced librations of an icy moon with a subsurface ocean. The model holds potential to predict the presence of a subsurface ocean through analysis of longitudinal librations. We demonstrate that a two-layered model, with a prestressed icy crust and a fixed mantle cavity, can effectively model the librational behavior of icy moons. The proposed model is applied to model the longitudinal libration of Enceladus and Mimas, two medium-sized icy moons of Saturn.

 - **Abstract**
 Using time-resolved multifrequency Very Long Baseline Array data and new KaVA (KVN and VERA Array) observations, we study the structure and kinematics of the jet of the flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) 1928+738. We find two distinct jet geometries as function of distance from the central black hole, with the inner jet having a parabolic shape, indicating collimation, and the outer jet having a conical shape, indicating free expansion of the jet plasma. Jet component speeds display a gradual outward acceleration up to a bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma_{\rm max} \approx10$, followed by a deceleration further downstream. The location of the acceleration zone matches the region where the jet collimation occurs; this is the first direct observation of an acceleration and collimation zone (ACZ) in an FSRQ. The ACZ terminates approximately at a distance of 5.6$\times 10^6$ gravitational radii, which is in good agreement with the sphere of gravitational influence of the supermassive black hole, implying that the physical extent of the ACZ is controlled by the black hole gravity. Our results suggest that confinement by an external medium is responsible for the jet collimation and that the jet is accelerated by converting Poynting flux energy to kinetic energy.

 - **Abstract**
 In circumstellar disks around young stars, the gravitational influence of nascent planets produces telltale patterns in density, temperature, and kinematics. To better understand these signatures, we first performed 3D hydrodynamical simulations of a 0.012 $M_{\odot}$ disk, with a Saturn-mass planet orbiting circularly in-plane at 40 au. We tested four different disk thermodynamic prescriptions (in increasing order of complexity, local isothermality, $\beta$-cooling, two-temperature radiation hydrodynamics, and three-temperature radiation hydrodynamics), finding that $\beta$-cooling offers a reasonable approximation for the three-temperature approach when the planet is not massive or luminous enough to substantially alter the background temperature and density structure. Thereafter, using the three-temperature scheme, we relaxed this assumption, simulating a range of different planet masses (Neptune-mass, Saturn-mass, Jupiter-mass) and accretion luminosities (0, $10^{-3} L_{\odot}$) in the same disk. Our investigation revealed that signatures of disk-planet interaction strengthen with increasing planet mass, with circumplanetary flows becoming prominent in the high-planet-mass regime. Accretion luminosity, which adds pressure support around the planet, was found to weaken the midplane Doppler-flip, potentially visible in optically thin tracers like C$^{18}$O, while strengthening the spiral signature, particularly in upper disk layers sensitive to thicker lines, like those of $^{12}$CO.

 - **Abstract**
 The light we observe from distant astrophysical objects including supernovae and quasars allows us to determine large distances in terms of a cosmological model. Despite the success of the standard cosmological model in fitting the data, there remains no underlying explanation for the accelerated expansion and dark matter. Furthermore, there is a current tension between early- and late-universe determinations of the Hubble constant. New techniques may offer the possibility of measuring out to larger distances, provide complementary information, or be able to side-step current limitations. After reviewing in detail the fundamentals of standard cosmology and gravitational lensing, including a derivation of the cosmological lens equation, this thesis investigates a novel method of cosmography based on combining the techniques of strong gravitational lensing time delay measurements and quasar reverberation mapping. The motivation for this method was the possibility of avoiding lens modelling challenges, such as the mass-sheet degeneracy, typically associated with time delay cosmography. It suggested that differential time delays originating from spatially separated signals in the Broad Line Region of a quasar could be distinguished and measured from the spectroscopy of the images, and utilised to provide a ratio of cosmological distances independent of the lensing potential. An analytic description of the effect of the differential lensing on the emission line spectral flux for axisymmetric Broad Line Region geometries is given, with the inclined ring or disk, spherical shell, and double cone as examples. This critical examination shows that the proposed method is unable to recover cosmological information, as the observed time delay and inferred line-of-sight velocity do not uniquely map to the three-dimensional position within the quasar.

          Prediction of the amplitude of solar cycle 25 from the ratio of sunspot number to sunspot-group area, low latitude activity, and 130-year solar cycle

 - **Abstract**
 We analysed the combined data of sunspot groups from Greenwich Photoheliographic Results (GPR) during the period 1874-1976 and Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) during 1977-2017 and determined the monthly mean, annual mean, and 13-month smoothed monthly mean whole sphere sunspot-group area (WSGA). We have also analysed the monthly mean, annual mean, and 13-month smoothed monthly mean version 2 of international sunspot number (SN) during the period 1874-2017. We fitted the annual mean WSGA and SN data during each of Solar Cycles 12-24 separately to the linear and nonlinear (parabola) forms. In the cases of Solar Cycles 14, 17, and 24 the nonlinear fits are found better than the linear fits. We find that there exists a secular decreasing trend in the slope of the WSGA-SN linear relation during Solar Cycles 12-24. A secular decreasing trend is also seen in the coefficient of the first order term of the nonlinear relation. The existence of ~77-year variation is seen in the ratio of the amplitude to WSGA at the maximum epoch of solar cycle. From the pattern of this long-term variation of the ratio we inferred that Solar Cycle 25 will be larger than both Solar Cycles 24 and 26. Using an our earlier method (now slightly revised) we predicted 127 (plus or minus 26) and 141 (plus or minus 19) for the amplitude of Solar Cycle~25. Based on ~130-year periodicity found in the cycle-to-cycle variation of the amplitudes of Solar Cycles 12-24 we find the shape of Solar Cycle 25 would be similar to that of Solar Cycle 13 and predicted for Solar Cycle 25 the amplitude 135 (plus or minus 8), maximum epoch 2024.21 (March 2024) plus or minus 6-month, and end epoch 2032.21 (March 2032) plus or minus 6-month with SN ~4.

 - **Abstract**
 The Lyman-alpha forest is a unique probe of large-scale matter density fluctuations at high redshift z > 2. We measure the one-dimensional Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum using the first data provided by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), with a fast Fourier transform estimator. The data sample contains quasar spectra included in the DESI Early Data Release and the first two months of the main survey. This first set of data already provides an improvement in terms of spectroscopic resolution with respect to the previous measurements. We investigated methodological and instrumental contaminants associated with DESI and used synthetic data to validate and correct our measurement. Coupling our measurement with theoretical predictions from hydrodynamical simulations will yield strong constraints on the primordial matter power spectrum, neutrino masses, and dark matter properties. A quadratic maximum likelihood estimator was applied to the same data set on a companion paper and agrees with our measurement.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effects of large inhomogeneities in both the inflaton field and its momentum. We find that in general, large kinetic perturbations reduce the number of e-folds of inflation. In particular, we observe that inflationary models with sub-Planckian characteristic scales are not robust even to kinetic energy densities that are sub-dominant to the potential energy density. This strengthens the results of our previous work. In inflationary models with super-Planckian characteristic scales, despite a reduction in the number of e-folds, inflation is robust even when the potential energy density is initially sub-dominant. For the cases we study, the robustness of inflation strongly depends on whether the inflaton field is driven into the reheating phase by the inhomogeneous scalar dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 The Telescope Array experiment has recently reported the most energetic event detected in the hybrid technique era, with a reconstructed energy of 240 EeV, which has been named "Amaterasu" after the Shinto deity. Its origin is intriguing since no powerful enough candidate sources are located within the region consistent with its propagation horizon and arrival direction. In this work, we investigate the possibility of describing its origin in a scenario of new physics, specifically under a Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) assumption. The kinematics of UHECR propagation under a phenomenological LIV approach is investigated. The total mean free path for a particle with Amaterasu's energy increases from a few Mpc to hundreds of Mpc for $-\delta_{\rm{had},0} > 10^{-22}$, expanding significantly the region from which it could have originated. A combined fit of the spectrum and composition data of Telescope Array under different LIV assumptions was performed. The data is best fitted with some level of LIV both with and without Amaterasu. The improvement of the LIV fit is larger when Amaterasu is considered. New physics in the form of LIV could, thus, provide a plausible explanation for the Amaterasu particle.

 - **Abstract**
 Potentially habitable exoplanets are targets of great interest for the James Webb Space Telescope and upcoming mission concepts such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory. Clouds strongly affect climate and habitability, but predicting their properties is difficult. In Global Climate Models (GCMs), especially those aiming at simulating Earth, cloud microphysics is often crudely approximated by assuming that all cloud particles have a single, constant size or a prescribed size distribution and that all clouds in a grid cell are identical. For exoplanets that range over a large phase space of planetary properties, this method could result in large errors. In this work, our goal is to determine how cloud microphysics on terrestrial exoplanets, whose condensable is mainly water vapor, depend on aerosol properties and planetary parameters such as surface pressure, surface gravity, and incident stellar radiation. We use the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres as a 1D microphysical model to simulate the formation and evolution of clouds including the processes of nucleation, condensation, evaporation, coagulation, and vertical transfer. In these 1D idealized experiments, we find that the parameters that determine the macrophysical thermal structure of the atmospheres, including surface pressure and stellar flux, impact cloud radiative effect (CRE) most significantly. Parameters such as gravity and number density of aerosols working as cloud condensation nuclei affect the microphysical processes of cloud formation, including activation and vertical transfer. They also have a significant, though weaker effect on CRE. This work motivates the development of more accurate GCM cloud schemes and should aid in the interpretation of future observations.

 Planetary nebulae (PNe) have three main components: a central star (CS), ionised gas and dust in the nebula. Each of them contains critical chemical fingerprints of their evolution, serving as tracers of the evolution, nucleosynthesis and dust production that occurred during the preceding asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. We aim to build a bridge to link the PN phase to the evolution of their progenitors, trying to better understand the dust production and mass-loss mechanism during the final AGB phase. Here, we present a comprehensive study of nine Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) spherical or elliptical PNe whose observations from the ultraviolet (UV) through the infrared (IR) are available in the literature. We characterize nebulae and CSs, finding information as the amount of gas that makes up the nebula and the dust that surrounds the CS, necessary to reconstruct the evolutionary history of mass-loss and dust production. We compare the observed energy distribution of the selected PNe to that obtained from photoionization modeling, taking into account the presence of dust. The physical and chemical parameters of the central stars are then compared with the predictions from the evolutionary tracks. We characterized the source, assigning to each CS a progenitor, early-AGB mass. We estimated the mass of the nebula and the dust-to-gas ratio. For 5 objects, we find evidence for the presence of a near-IR bump, which would be connected to the presence of hot dust.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we study the filamentary substructure of 3.3 $\mu$m PAH emission from JWST/NIRCam observations in the base of the M82 star-burst driven wind. We identify plume-like substructure within the PAH emission with widths of $\sim$50 pc. Several of the plumes extend to the edge of the field-of-view, and thus are at least 200-300 pc in length. In this region of the outflow, the vast majority ($\sim$70\%) of PAH emission is associated with the plumes. We show that those structures contain smaller scale "clouds" with widths that are $\sim$5-15 pc, and they are morphologically similar to the results of "cloud-crushing" simulations. We estimate the cloud-crushing time-scales of $\sim$0.5-3 Myr, depending on assumptions. We show this time scale is consistent with a picture in which these observed PAH clouds survived break-out from the disk rather than being destroyed by the hot wind. The PAH emission in both the midplane and the outflow is shown to tightly correlate with that of Pa$\alpha$ emission (from HST/NICMOS data), at the scale of both plumes and clouds, though the ratio of PAH-to-Pa$\alpha$ increases at further distances from the midplane. Finally, we show that the outflow PAH emission is suppressed in regions of the M82 wind that are bright in X-ray emission. Overall, our results are broadly consistent with a picture in which cold gas in galactic outflows is launched via hierarchically structured plumes, and those small scale clouds are more likely to survive the wind environment when collected into the larger plume structure.
