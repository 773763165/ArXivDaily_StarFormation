 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of four blue lurkers with low and extremely low-mass white dwarf (ELM WDs) companions in the Galactic globular cluster NGC 362 using AstroSat Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT). We analyzed the multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) of FUV-bright MS stars using data from the UVIT, UVOT, GAIA EDR3, and 2.2m ESO/MPI telescopes. Two each of low-mass WDs and ELM WDs are found as companions for the four blue lurkers by the fitting of two-component SED models. The effective temperatures, radii, luminosities, and masses of two low-mass WDs are (35000, 23000) K, (0.04, 0.05) Rsun , (1.45, 0.22) Lsun , and (0.2, 0.2) Msun, while the two ELM WDs are (14750, 14750) K, (0.09, 0.10) Rsun, (0.34, 0.40) Lsun, and (0.18, 0.18) Msun. The position of blue lurkers within the cluster shows that they originated via the Case A/B mass-transfer mechanism in a low-density environment. This is the first detection of blue lurkers with low-mass WDs and ELM WDs as companions in a globular cluster. The companion cooling age is less than 4 Myr, which suggests that they were just recently formed. These binary systems might have originated due to the cluster recent core collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has an extensive H$_{\alpha}$ emission halo that traces an extended, warm ionized component of its interstellar medium. Using the Wisconsin H$_{\alpha}$ Mapper (WHAM) telescope, we present the first kinematic \ha\ survey of an extensive region around the LMC, from $l,b = (264\deg .5,\,-45\deg .5)$ to $(295\deg .5,\,-19\deg .5)$, covering $+150\leq v_{lsr} \leq +390~ km s^{-1}$. We find that ionized hydrogen exists throughout the galaxy and extends several degrees beyond detected neutral hydrogen emission $(\log{\left(N_{\rm H_{~I}/\rm cm^{-2}}\right)\approx18.3})$ as traced by 21-cm in current surveys. Using the column density structure of the neutral gas and stellar line-of-sight depths as a guide, we estimate the upper limit mass of the ionized component of the LMC to be roughly $M_\mathrm{ionized}\approx (0.6-1.8)\times 10^{9}\,\mathrm{M}_{sun}$, which is comparable to the total neutral atomic gas mass in the same region ($M_\mathrm{neutral}\approx0.75-0.85\times10^{9}\,\mathrm{M}_{sun}$). Considering only the atomic phases, we find $M_\mathrm{ionized}/M_\mathrm{ionized+neutral}$, to be 46\%--68\% throughout the LMC and its extended halo. Additionally, we find an ionized gas cloud that extends off of the LMC at $l,b \approx (285\deg, -28\deg)$ into a region previously identified as the Leading Arm complex. This gas is moving at a similar line-of-sight velocity as the LMC and has $M_\mathrm{ionized}/M_\mathrm{ionized+neutral} =$ 13\%--51\%. This study, combined with previous studies of the SMC and extended structures of the Magellanic Clouds, continues to suggest that warm, ionized gas is as massive and dynamically-important as the neutral gas in the Magellanic System.$

 - **Abstract**
 We present 850 $\mu$m polarization and $\rm C^{18}O (3-2)$ molecular line observations toward the X-shaped nebula in the California molecular cloud using the JCMT SCUBA-2/POL-2 and HARP instruments. The 850 $\mu$m emission shows that the observed region includes two elongated filamentary structures (Fil1 and Fil2) having chains of regularly spaced cores. We measured the mass per unit length of the filament and found that Fil1 and Fil2 are thermally super- and subcritical, respectively, but both are subcritical if nonthermal turbulence is considered. The mean projected spacings ($\Delta\bar S$) of cores in Fil1 and Fil2 are 0.13 and 0.16 pc, respectively. $\Delta\bar S$ are smaller than $4\times$filament width expected in the classical cylinder fragmentation model. The large-scale magnetic field orientations shown by Planck are perpendicular to the long axes of Fil1 and Fil2, while those in the filaments obtained from the high-resolution polarization data of JCMT are disturbed, but those in Fil1 tend to have longitudinal orientations. Using the modified Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) method, we estimated the magnetic field strengths ($B_{\rm pos}$) of filaments which are 110$\pm$80 and 90$\pm$60 $\mu$G. We calculated the gravitational, kinematic, and magnetic energies of the filaments, and found that the fraction of magnetic energy is larger than 60 % in both filaments. We propose that a dominant magnetic energy may lead the filament to be fragmented into aligned cores as suggested by Tang et al., and a shorter core spacing can be due to a projection effect via the inclined geometry of filaments or due to a non-negligible, longitudinal magnetic fields in case of Fil1.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic phase curves of transiting hot Jupiters are spectral measurements at multiple orbital phases, giving a set of disc-averaged spectra that probe multiple hemispheres. By fitting model phase curves to observations, we can constrain the atmospheric properties of hot Jupiters such as molecular abundance, aerosol distribution and thermal structure, which offer insights into their dynamics, chemistry, and formation. In this work, we propose a novel 2D temperature scheme consisting of a dayside and a nightside to retrieve information from near-infrared phase curves, and apply the scheme to phase curves of WASP-43b observed by HST/WFC3 and Spitzer/IRAC. In our scheme, temperature is constant on isobars on the nightside and varies with cos$^n$(longitude/$\epsilon$) on isobars on the dayside, where $n$ and $\epsilon$ are free parameters. We fit all orbital phases simultaneously using the radiative transfer code NEMESISPY coupled to a Bayesian inference code. We first validate the performance of our retrieval scheme with synthetic phase curves generated from a GCM, and find our 2D scheme can accurately retrieve the latitudinally-averaged thermal structure and constrain the abundance of H$_2$O and CH$_4$. We then apply our 2D scheme to the observed phase curves of WASP-43b and find: (1) the dayside temperature-pressure profiles do not vary strongly with longitude and are non-inverted; (2) the retrieved nightside temperatures are extremely low, suggesting significant nightside cloud coverage; (3) the H$_2$O volume mixing ratio is constrained to $5.6\times10^{-5}$--$4.0\times10^{-4}$, and we retrieve an upper bound for CH$_4$ at $\sim$10$^{-6}$.
#### Model of Cosmic Ray Propagation in the Milky Way at the Knee

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new model of anisotropic cosmic ray propagation in the Milky Way, where cosmic rays are injected at discrete transient sources in the disc and propagated in the Galactic magnetic field. In the framework of our model, we show that the cosmic ray spectrum is time-dependent and space-dependent around the energy of the knee. It has a major contribution of one or a few nearby recent sources at any given location in the Galaxy, in particular at the position of the Solar system. We find that the distribution of $\sim$ PeV cosmic rays in our Galaxy is significantly clumpy and inhomogeneous, and therefore substantially different from the smoother distribution of GeV cosmic rays. Our findings have important implications for the calculation and future interpretation of the diffuse Galactic gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes at very high energies.
#### Aspherical ULDM Collapse: Variation in the Core-Halo Mass Relation

 - **Abstract**
 Ultralight dark matter (ULDM) is an interesting alternative to the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. Due to the extremely low mass of the constituent particle ($\sim 10^{-22}$ eV), ULDM can exhibit quantum effects up to kiloparsec scales. In particular, runaway collapse in the centres of ULDM halos is prevented by quantum pressure, providing a possible resolution to the 'core-cusp problem' of CDM. However, the the detailed relationship between the ULDM core mass and that of the overall halo is poorly understood. We simulate the collapse of both spherical and aspherical isolated ULDM overdensities using AxioNyx, finding that the central cores of collapsed halos undergo sustained oscillatory behaviour which affects both their peak density and overall morphology. The variability in core morphology increases with the asphericity of the initial overdensity and remnants of initial asphericity persist long after collapse. Furthermore, the peak central densities are higher in spherical configurations. Consequently, astrophysically realistic halos may exhibit substantial departures from theoretical core-halo profiles and we would expect a significant variance of the properties of halos with the same mass.
#### Field-level Lyman-alpha forest modelling in redshift space via augmented  non-local Fluctuating Gunn-Peterson Approximation

 - **Abstract**
 We present an improved analytical model to predict the Lyman-alpha forest at the field level in redshift space from the dark matter field, expanding upon the widely-used Fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation (FGPA). In particular, we introduce the dependence on the cosmic web environment (knots, filaments, sheets, voids) in the model, thereby effectively accounting for non-local bias. Furthermore, we include a detailed treatment of velocity bias in the redshift space distortions modelling, allowing the velocity bias to be cosmic-web dependent. We find evidence for a significant difference of the same model parameters in different environments, suggesting that for the investigated setup the simple standard FGPA is not able to adequately predict the Lyman-alpha forest in the different cosmic web regimes. We reproduce the summary statistics of the reference cosmological hydrodynamic simulation we use for comparison, yielding accurate mean transmitted flux, probability distribution function, 3D power spectrum, and bispectrum. In particular, we achieve maximum deviation and average deviations accuracy in the Lyman-alpha forest 3D power spectrum of $\sim 3\%$ and $\sim 0.1\%$ up to $k\sim 0.4 \, h \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, $\sim 5\%$ and $\sim 1.8\%$ up to $k \sim 1.4 \, h \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Our new model outperforms previous analytical efforts to predict the Lyman-alpha forest at the field level in all the probed summary statistics, and has the potential to become instrumental in the generation of fast accurate mocks for covariance matrices estimation in the context of current and forthcoming Lyman-alpha forest surveys.
