          Planet Mass Function around M stars at 1-10 au: A Plethora of sub-Earth mass objects

 - **Abstract**
 Small planets ($\lesssim 1$ M$_\oplus$) at intermediate orbital distances ($\sim$1 au) represent an uncharted territory in exoplanetary science. The upcoming microlensing survey by the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will be sensitive to objects as light as Ganymede and unveil the small planet population at $1-10$ au. Instrumental sensitivity to such planets is low and the number of objects we will discover is strongly dependent on the underlying planet mass function. In this work, we provide a physically motivated planet mass function by combining the efficiency of planet formation by pebble accretion with the observed disk mass function. Because the disk mass function for M dwarfs ($0.4-0.6 \, M_\odot$) is bottom heavy, the initial planet mass function is also expected to be bottom-heavy, skewing towards Ganymede and Mars mass objects, more so for heavier initial planetary seeds. We follow the subsequent dynamical evolution of planetary systems over $\sim$100 Myr varying the initial eccentricity and orbital spacing. For initial planet separations of $\geq$3 local disk scale heights, we find that Ganymede and Mars mass planets do not grow significantly by mergers. However, Earth-like planets undergo vigorous merging and turn into super-Earths, potentially creating a gap in the planet mass function at $\sim 1$ M$_{\oplus}$. Our results demonstrate that the slope of the mass function and the location of the potential gap in the mass function can probe the initial architecture of multi-planet systems. We close by discussing implications on the expected difference between bound and free-floating planet mass functions.

          Speeding up the Universe with a generalised axion-like potential

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the late-time acceleration of the Universe is one of the major challenges in cosmology today. In this paper, we present a new scalar field model corresponding to a generalised axion-like potential. In fact, this model can be framed as a quintessence model based on physically motivated considerations. This potential is capable of alleviating the coincidence problem through a tracking regime. We will as well prove that this potential allows for a late-time acceleration period induced by an effective cosmological constant, which is reached without fine-tuning the initial conditions of the scalar field. In our model, the generalised axion field fuels the late-time acceleration of the Universe rather than fuelling an early dark energy era. Additionally, we will show how the late-time transition to dark energy dominance could be favoured in this model, since the density parameter of the scalar field will rapidly grow in the late phase of the tracking regime.

          Long-lived neutron-star remnants from asymmetric binary neutron star mergers: element formation, kilonova signals and gravitational waves

 - **Abstract**
 We present 3D general-relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics simulations of asymmetric binary neutron star mergers producing long-lived neutron stars remnants and spanning a fraction of their cooling time scale. Two binaries with mass ratios of $1.77$ and $1.49$ described by a stiff and a soft microphysical equation of state are considered. The mergers are characterized by significant tidal disruption with neutron rich material forming a massive disc around the remnant. The latter develops a one-armed dynamics that is imprinted in the emitted kilo-Hertz gravitational waves. Angular momentum transport to the disc is initially driven by spiral-density waves and enhanced by turbulent viscosity and neutrino heating on longer timescales. The mass outflows are composed by neutron-rich dynamical ejecta of mass ${\sim}10^{-3}-10^{-2}M_\odot$ followed by a persistent spiral-wave/neutrino-driven wind of ${\gtrsim}10^{-2}M_\odot$ with material spanning a wide range of electron fractions, ${\sim}0.1-0.55$. For the stiff EOS and largest mass ratio binary, tidal dynamical ejecta have fast tails up to velocities ${\sim}0.8$~c. The outflows are further evolved to days timescale using 2D ray-by-ray radiation-hydrodynamics simulations that include an online nuclear network. We find complete $r$-process yields and identify the production of $^{56}$Ni and the subsequent decay chain to $^{56}$Co and $^{56}$Fe. Synthetic kilonova light curves predict an extended (near-) infrared peak a few days postmerger originating from $r$-processes in the neutron-rich/high-opacity ejecta and a UV/optical peak a few hours postmerger originating from weak $r$-processes in the faster ejecta components. Additionally, the fast tail of tidal origin generates kilonova afterglows potentially detectable in radio and X band on a few to ten years timescale. (Abridged)
#### Title:
          The core collapse of a 16.5 M$_{\odot}$ star

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the 1D stellar evolution of a 16.5 M$_{\odot}$ zero-age main-sequence star having different initial rotations. Starting from the pre-main-sequence, the models evolve up to the onset of the core collapse stage. The collapse of such a massive star can result in several kinds of energetic transients, such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Supernovae, etc. Using the simulation parameters, we calculate their free-fall timescales when the models reach the stage of the onset of core collapse. Estimating the free-fall timescale is crucial for understanding the duration for which the central engine can be fueled, allowing us to compare the free-fall timescale with the T$_{\rm 90}$ duration of GRBs. Our results indicate that, given the constraints of the parameters and initial conditions in our models, rapidly rotating massive stars might serve as potential progenitors of Ultra-Long GRBs (T$_{\rm 90}$ $>>$ 500 sec). In contrast, the non-rotating or slowly rotating models are more prone to explode as hydrogen-rich Type IIP-like core-collapse supernovae.

          Revisiting the Vertical Distribution of HI Absorbing Clouds in the Solar Neighborhood. II. Constraints from a Large Catalog of 21 cm Absorption Observations at High Galactic Latitudes

 - **Abstract**
 The cold neutral medium (CNM) is where neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) is converted into molecular clouds, so the structure and kinematics of the CNM are key drivers of galaxy evolution. Here we provide new constraints on the vertical distribution of the CNM using the recently-developed $\texttt{kinematic_scaleheight}$ software package and a large catalog of sensitive HI absorption observations. We estimate the thickness of the CNM in the solar neighborhood to be $\sigma_z\sim50$$\unicode{x2013}$$90~\mathrm{pc}$, assuming a Gaussian vertical distribution. This is a factor of $\sim2$ smaller than typically assumed, indicating the thickness of the CNM in the solar neighborhood is similar to that found in the inner Galaxy, consistent with recent simulation results. If we consider only structures with HI optical depths $\tau>0.1$ or column densities $N(\mathrm{HI})>10^{19.5}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, which recent work suggests are thresholds for molecule formation, we find $\sigma_z\sim50~\mathrm{pc}$. Meanwhile, for structures with $\tau<0.1$ or column densities $N(\mathrm{HI})<10^{19.5}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, we find $\sigma_z\sim120~\mathrm{pc}$. These thicknesses are similar to those derived for the thin- and thick-disk molecular cloud populations traced by CO emission, possibly suggesting that cold HI and CO are well-mixed. Approximately $20\%$ of CNM structures are identified as outliers, with kinematics that are not well-explained by Galactic rotation. We show that some of these CNM structures $\unicode{x2014}$ perhaps representing intermediate velocity clouds $\unicode{x2014}$ are associated with the Local Bubble wall. We compare our results to recent observations and simulations, and we discuss their implications for the multiphase structure of the Milky Way's interstellar medium.

          3D Modeling of Moist Convective Inhibition in Hydrogen-Dominated Atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 Many planets have hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, including sub-Neptune exoplanets, recently formed planets with primordial atmospheres, and the Solar System's giant planets. Atmospheric convection behaves differently in hydrogen-rich atmospheres compared to higher mean molecular weight atmospheres due to compositional gradients of tracers. Previous 1D studies suggested that compositional gradients of condensing tracers in hydrogen-rich atmospheres can entirely shut-off convection when the tracer abundance exceeds a critical threshold, leading to the formation of radiative layers where the temperature decreases faster with height than in convective profiles. We use 3D convection-resolving simulations to determine if convection is inhibited in hydrogen-rich atmospheres when the tracer mixing ratio exceeds the critical threshold. Three simulation sets are performed with a water vapor tracer in hydrogen-rich atmospheres. First, we perform simulations initialized on saturated isothermal states and find that compositional gradients can destabilize isothermal states, leading to rapid convective mixing. Next, simulations initialized on adiabatic profiles show distinct, stable inhibition layers form when the water vapor tracer exceeds the critical threshold defined by previous studies. Within the inhibition layers, a small amount of energy is transported through condensation and re-evaporation, contrary to previous findings. The thermal profile slowly relaxes to a steep radiative state, but radiative relaxation timescales are long. Lastly, we show that superadiabatic temperature profiles can remain stable when the tracer abundance is greater than the critical amount. Our results suggest stable layers driven by condensation-induced convective inhibition form in hydrogen-rich atmospheres, including those of sub-Neptune exoplanets.

          Numerical simulation of common envelope stage in close binary systems: comparison between Newtonian and modified gravity

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the important stage in evolution of close binary system namely common envelope phase in framework of various models of modified gravity. The comparison of results between calculations in Newtonian gravity and modified gravity allows to estimate possible observational imprints of modified gravity. Although declination from Newtonian gravity should be negligible we can propose that due to the long times some new effects can appear. We use the moving-mesh code AREPO for numerical simulation of binary system consisting of $\sim M_{\odot}$ white dwarf and a red giant with mass $\sim 2 M_{\odot}$. For implementing modified gravity into AREPO code we apply the method of (pseudo)potential, assuming that modified gravity can be described by small corrections to usual Newtonian gravitational potential. As in Newtonian case initial orbit has to shrink due to the energy transfer to the envelope of a giant. We investigated evolution of common envelope in a case of simple model of modified gravity with various values of parameters and compared results with simulation in frames of Newtonian gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 We report a new, reliable determination of the CN excitation temperature of diffuse molecular clouds in the Milky Way, based on ultra high spectral resolution observations. Our determination is based on CN $B^{2}\Sigma^{+}-X^{2}\Sigma^{+}$ (0,0) vibrational band absorption spectra seen along the lines of sight to eight bright Galactic stars. Our analysis is conducted blind, and we account for multiple sources of systematic uncertainty. Like previous studies, our excitation temperature measures exhibit an intrinsic scatter that exceeds the quoted uncertainties. Accounting for this scatter, we derive a 3% determination of the typical CN excitation temperature, $T_{01}=2.769^{+0.084}_{-0.072}~{\rm K}$, which is consistent with the direct determination of the cosmic microwave background temperature. We also perform a single joint fit to all sightlines, and find that our data can be simultaneously fit with an excitation temperature $T_{01}=2.725\pm0.015~{\rm K}$ -- a 0.55% measure that is consistent with the CMB temperature. We propose a future observational strategy to reduce systematic uncertainties and firmly test the limitations of using CN as a cosmic microwave background thermometer.

 - **Abstract**
 We present spectroscopic and photometric observations of Bernhard-2, which was previously identified as a candidate system to host a misaligned circumbinary disk. Our spectroscopic measurements confirm that Bernhard-2 indeed contains an eccentric ($e=0.69 \pm 0.08$) binary and thus that the periodic variability in the photometric light curve is best explained by the occultation by the misaligned circumbinary disk. By modeling the spectral energy distributions at different phases, we infer the system age to be $\sim 20\,$Myr and the masses of the two binary components to be $\sim 1.1\,M_\odot$ and $\sim 0.9\,M_\odot$, respectively. Our new photometric observations show clear deviations from the model prediction based on the archival data, suggesting ongoing precession of the circumbinary disk. The H$\alpha$ line of Bernhard-2 also shows an inverse P-Cygni profile at epochs close to the pericenter passage, which could be attributed to the pulsed accretion around the pericenter. Bernhard-2 therefore closely resembles the well studied KH 15D system. Further detailed observations and studies of such rare systems can provide useful information about disk physics and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The Polana-Eulalia Complex (PEC) is an Inner Main Belt, C-complex asteroid population that may be the source of the near-Earth asteroid spacecraft mission targets (101955) Bennu and (162173) Ryugu. Here, we report a size-based investigation of the visible (VIS; 0.47 -- 0.89 um) spectrophotometric slopes of the PEC's constituent families, the New Polana and Eulalia Families. Using two releases of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Moving Object Catalog as well as the 3rd data release of the Gaia catalog, we present evidence of size-based slope variability within each family. We find that Eulalia family members exhibit lower average slopes than Polana family members in all catalogs' samples, particularly for objects < 9 km in diameter. We are unable to conclude that VIS slope distinguishability between the families is statistically significant, but we explore a potential cause of the bulk slope differences between the PEC families, in addition to providing commentary on size-slope trends generally.

          Decade-long Periodicity Study of 2FHL Blazars with Historical Optical Data

 - **Abstract**
 In our recent investigation, we utilized a century's worth of archival optical data to search for a decade-long periodicity from the blazar PG 1553+113, finding a hint of a 22-year period. Building on this foundation, the current study extends our analysis to include 10 blazars from the Fermi Large Area Telescope 2FHL catalog to uncover similar long-term periodic behavior. To ensure the reliability of our findings, we consider the impact of observational limitations, such as temporal gaps and uneven sampling, which could potentially introduce artifacts or false periodic signals. Our analysis reveals that 4 of these blazars (AP Librae, MKN 421, MKN 501, PG 1246+586) exhibit decade-long periods in their optical light curves, albeit 3 of them may be influenced by noise. However, a likely genuine period of approximately 51 $\pm$ 9 yr is identified for MKN 421.

          Bayesian Insights into post-Glitch Dynamics: Model comparison and parameter constraint from decades long observation data of the Crab pulsar

 - **Abstract**
 The Crab Pulsar has exhibited numerous glitches accompanied by persistent shifts in its spin-down rate. The explanation of the observed persistent shifts remain a challenge. We perform a detailed Bayesian analysis to compare four data-fitting models, ranging from a simple linear model to more complex power-law and logarithmic models, using a dataset of observed glitches and persistent shifts. Our results show the large observed events are difficult to explain by the usually assumed linear model due to starquakes. A particularly notable finding is that the logarithmic model provides the best fit to the observation data but the two power-law models show a close tie to it. Detail differences of these models may be further clarified by the understanding of internal physics of neutron stars.

 SST-1M is a single-mirror small size Cherenkov telescope prototype developed by a consortium among institutes in Switzerland, Poland, and the Czech Republic. With a 9.42 m$^2$ multi-segment mirror and a 5.6 m focal length, SST-1Ms have a broad 9 degree field of view and aim to detect gamma-rays spanning the energy range of 1 to 300 TeV. The DigiCam camera incorporates a compact Photo-Detector Plane comprising 1296 hexagonal silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) pixels and a fully digital readout and trigger system using a 250 MHz ADC. Currently undergoing commissioning at the Ondrejov Observatory in the Czech Republic, two SST-1M telescopes are actively collecting data through observations of astrophysical gamma-ray sources. This presentation provides an overview of the telescope, camera design, and analysis pipeline, including evaluations of the instrument's responses. Preliminary results derived from ongoing observations are presented. A specific focus on data analysis of stereoscopic observations of the Crab Nebula provide insights on the telescope's sensitivity and performances.

          Terrestrial planet formation during giant planet formation and giant planet migration I: The first 5 million years

 - **Abstract**
 Terrestrial planet formation (TPF) is a difficult problem that has vexed researchers for decades. Numerical models are only partially successful at reproducing the orbital architecture of the inner planets, but have generally not considered the effect of the growth of the giant planets. I dynamically model TPF as the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn are growing using GENGA. The evolution of the masses, radii and orbital elements of the gas giants are precomputed and read and interpolated within GENGA. The terrestrial planets are formed by planetesimal accretion from tens of thousands of self-gravitating planetesimals spread between 0.5 au and 8.5 au. The total mass of the inner planetesimal disc and outer disc are typically 2 and 3 Earth masses respectively, and the composition of the planetesimals changes from non-carbonaceous-like to carbonaceous-like at a prescribed distance, ranging from 2 au to 5 au. After 5 Myr of evolution approximately 10% to 25% of the mass of planetesimals in the Jupiter-Saturn region is implanted in the inner solar system, which is more than what cosmochemical models predict. The implantation initially sets up a composition gradient in the inner solar system, with the fraction of outer solar system material increasing with increasing distance to the Sun. The planetesimals that remain in the inner solar system have a mixed composition. The growth of the gas giants scatters planetesimals in their vicinity into the inner solar system, which changes the isotopic composition of the terrestrial planets. The planetesimal disc in the vicinity of the gas giants may not have been very massive, ~1 ME. The inner planetesimal disc may not have extended much farther than 2 au otherwise embryos do not grow fast enough to produce Mars analogues. This could mean that the region of the current asteroid belt never contained much mass to begin with.

          The progenitors of Be-stars paired with O-subdwarfs: the spin-up of a Be star at the stage of conservative mass exchange

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 The spinning-up of the accreting component in the process of conservative mass exchange is considered in binary systems - progenitors of systems consisting of a main sequence Be-star and an O-subdwarf. During the mass exchange, the meridional circulation transfers 80-85\% of the angular momentum that entered the accretor together with the accreted matter to the accretor surface. This angular momentum is removed from the accretor by the disk. When the mass exchange finishes, the accretor has a rotation typical of classical Be-type stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Relative distances between a high-redshift sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia), anchored to a low-redshift sample, have been instrumental in drawing insights on the nature of the dark energy driving the accelerated expansion of the universe. A combination (hereafter called SBC) of the SNe~Ia with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) recently indicated deviations from the standard interpretation of dark energy as a cosmological constant. In this paper, we analyse various systematic uncertainties in the distance measurement of SNe~Ia and their impact on the inferred dark energy properties in the canonical Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model. We model systematic effects like photometric calibration, progenitor and dust evolution, and uncertainty in the galactic extinction law. We find that all the dominant systematic errors shift the dark energy inference towards the DESI 2024 results from an underlying $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. A small change in the calibration, and change in the Milky Way dust, can give rise to systematic-driven shifts on $w_0$-$w_a$ constraints, comparable to the deviation reported from the DESI 2024 results. We forecast that the systematic uncertainties can shift the inference of $w_0-w_a$ by a few times the error ellipse for future low- and high-$z$ SN~Ia compilations and hence, it is critical to circumvent them to robustly test for deviations from $\Lambda$.

 - **Abstract**
 The first adiabatic exponent profile, noted $\Gamma_1$, computed along adiabatic coordinats $(T, \rho)$ is in the focus of our study. Under conditions of almost fully ionized hydrogen and helium, the $\Gamma_1$ profile is quite sensitive to heavy elements ionization. $\Gamma_1$ decreases in regions where an element is partially ionized. The recent helioseismic structural inversion is obtained with an accuracy better than $10^{-4}$ in the most of the adiabatic convective zone that allows to study ionization variations. The aim is to determine the major heavy elements content in the solar convective zone. The method of our research is synthesis of the $\Gamma_1$ profile which is based on a linear combination of the contributions of individual heavy elements. The idea of the approach was proposed and justified by Baturin et al. (Astron. Astrophys., 660, A125, 2022). We find the best approximation of the inverted profile $\Gamma_1$ adjusting the abundances of major elements (C, N, O, Ne), meanwhile the abundances of elements heavier than neon are fixed. We synthesize the theoretical $\Gamma_1$ profile using the SAHA-S equation of state, and are able to reproduce the inverted profiles with an accuracy of $(1-2)\cdot 10^{-5}$. Total mass fraction of heavy elements found by this method is $Z=0.0148\pm 0.0004$. The oxygen logarithmic abundance is $8.70\pm 0.03$, carbon $8.44\pm 0.04$, nitrogen $8.12\pm 0.08$, and neon $8.17\pm 0.09$. The obtained estimations of oxygen and carbon agree with spectroscopic abundances by Asplund et al. (Astron. Astrophys., 653, A141, 2021).

 The search for relics from the inflation era in the form of B-mode polarization of the CMB is a major challenge in cosmology. The main obstacle appears to come from the complexity of Galactic foregrounds that need to be removed. Multi-frequency observations are key to mitigating their contamination and mapping primordial fluctuations. We present "Spectral-Imaging", a method to reconstruct sub-frequency maps of the CMB polarization within the instrument's physical bandwidth, a unique feature of Bolometric Interferometry that could be crucial for foreground mitigation as it provides an increased spectral resolution. Our technique uses the frequency evolution of the shape of the Bolometric Interferometer's synthesized beam to reconstruct frequency information from the time domain data. We reconstruct sub-frequency maps using an inverse problem approach based on detailed modeling of the instrument acquisition. We use external data to regularize the convergence of the estimator and account for bandpass mismatch and varying angular resolution. The reconstructed maps are unbiased and allow exploiting the spectral-imaging capacity of QUBIC. Using end-to-end simulations of the QUBIC instrument, we perform a cross-spectra analysis to extract a forecast on the tensor-to-scalar ratio constraint of $\sigma(r) = 0.0225$ after component separation.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of B-modes in the CMB polarization pattern is a major issue in modern cosmology and must therefore be handled with analytical methods that produce reliable results. We describe a method that uses the frequency dependency of the QUBIC synthesized beam to perform component separation at the map-making stage, to obtain more precise results. We aim to demonstrate the feasibility of component separation during the map-making stage in time domain space. This new technique leads to a more accurate description of the data and reduces the biases in cosmological analysis. The method uses a library for highly parallel computation which facilitates the programming and permits the description of experiments as easily manipulated operators. These operators can be combined to obtain a joint analysis using several experiments leading to maximized precision. The results show that the method works well and permits end-to-end analysis for the CMB experiments, and in particular, for QUBIC. The method includes astrophysical foregrounds, and also systematic effects like gain variation in the detectors. We developed a software pipeline that produces uncertainties on tensor-to-scalar ratio at the level of $\sigma(r) \sim 0.023$ using only QUBIC simulated data.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanets form from circumstellar protoplanetary discs whose fundamental properties (notably their extent, composition, mass, temperature and lifetime) depend on the host star properties, such as their mass and luminosity. B-stars are among the most massive stars and their protoplanetary discs test extreme conditions for exoplanet formation. This paper investigates the frequency of giant planet companions around young B-stars (median age of 16 Myr) in the Scorpius-Centaurus association, the closest association containing a large population of B-stars. We systematically search for massive exoplanets with the high-contrast direct imaging instrument SPHERE using the data from the BEAST survey, that targets an homogeneous sample of young B-stars from the wide Sco-Cen association. We derive accurate detection limits in case of non-detections. We found evidence in previous papers for two substellar companions around 42 stars. The masses of these companions are straddling the ~13 Jupiter mass deuterium burning limit but their mass ratio with respect to their host star is close to that of Jupiter. We derive a frequency of such massive planetary mass companions around B stars of 11-5+7%, accounting for the survey sensitivity. The discoveries of substellar companions bcen b and mu2sco B happened after only few stars in the survey had been observed, raising the possibility that massive Jovian planets might be common around B-stars. However our statistical analysis show that the occurrence rate of such planets is similar around B-stars and around solar-type stars of similar age, while B-star companions exhibit low mass ratios and larger semi-major axis.

 - **Abstract**
 Instruments for gamma-ray astronomy at Very High Energies ($E>100\,{\rm GeV}$) have traditionally derived their scientific results through proprietary data and software. Data standardisation has become a prominent issue in this field both as a requirement for the dissemination of data from the next generation of gamma-ray observatories and as an effective solution to realise public data legacies of current-generation instruments. Specifications for a standardised gamma-ray data format have been proposed as a community effort and have already been successfully adopted by several instruments. We present the first production of standardised data from the Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes. We converted $166\,{\rm h}$ of observations from different sources and validated their analysis with the open-source software Gammapy. We consider six data sets representing different scientific and technical analysis cases and compare the results obtained analysing the standardised data with open-source software against those produced with the MAGIC proprietary data and software. Aiming at a systematic production of MAGIC data in this standardised format, we also present the implementation of a database-driven pipeline automatically performing the MAGIC data reduction from the calibrated down to the standardised data level. In all the cases selected for the validation, we obtain results compatible with the MAGIC proprietary software, both for the manual and for the automatic data productions. Part of the validation data set is also made publicly available, thus representing the first large public release of MAGIC data. This effort and this first data release represent a technical milestone toward the realisation of a public MAGIC data legacy.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the evolution of radial sizes and instantaneous expansion speeds of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is crucial for assessing their impact duration on Earth's environment. We introduce a non-conventional approach to derive the CME's radial sizes and expansion speeds at different instances during its passage over a single-point in situ spacecraft. We also estimate the CME's radial sizes and expansion speeds during its journey from the Sun to 1 AU using the 3D kinematics of different CME features, including the leading edge (LE), center, and trailing edge (TE). The continuous 3D kinematics of the CME is estimated by employing the GCS and SSSE reconstruction methods on multi-point observations from coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers combined with the drag-based model. We choose the 2010 April 3 CME as a suitable case for our study, promising a more accurate comparison of its remote and in situ observations. We show that the introduced non-conventional approach can provide better accuracy in estimating radial sizes and instantaneous expansion speeds of CMEs at different instances. We examine the aspect ratio of the CME, which influences its expansion behavior and shows the discrepancy between its value in the corona and interplanetary medium. Our study highlights significant inconsistencies in the arrival time, radial size, and expansion speed estimates obtained from remote and in situ observations. We advocate for future studies leveraging multi-spacecraft in situ observations and our non-conventional approach to analyze them to improve the comprehension of CME dynamics in the solar wind.

 - **Abstract**
 The strong-field gravity in General Relativity (GR) realized in neutron stars (NSs) renders the Equation of State (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$ of supradense neutron star (NS) matter to be essentially nonlinear and refines the upper bound for $\phi\equiv P/\varepsilon$ to be much smaller than the Special Relativity (SR) requirement with linear EOSs, where $P$ and $\varepsilon$ are respectively the pressure and energy density of the system considered. Specifically, a tight bound $\phi\lesssim0.374$ is obtained by anatomizing perturbatively the intrinsic structures of the scaled Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations without using any input nuclear EOS. New insights gained from this novel analysis provide EOS-model independent constraints on properties (e.g., density profiles of the sound speed squared $s^2=\d P/\d\varepsilon$ and trace anomaly $\Delta=1/3-\phi$) of cold supradense matter in NS cores. Using the gravity-matter duality in theories describing NSs, we investigate the impact of gravity on supradense matter EOS in NSs. In particular, we show that the NS mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$, radius $R$ and its compactness $\xi\equiv M_{\rm{NS}}/R$ scale with certain combinations of its central pressure and energy density (encapsulating its central EOS). Thus, observational data on these properties of NSs can straightforwardly constrain NS central EOSs without relying on any specific nuclear EOS-model.

 - **Abstract**
 While many astrophysical plasmas can be modelled successfully assuming ionisation and thermal equilibrium, in some cases this is not appropriate and a non-equilibrium approach is required. In nebulae around evolved stars the local elemental abundances may also strongly vary in space and time. Here we present a non-equilibrium multi-ion module developed for the fluid-dynamics code \textsc{pion}, describing the physical processes included and demonstrating its capabilities with some test calculations. A non-equilbrium ionisation solver is developed that allows arbitrary elemental abundances for neutral and ionised (but not molecular) gas, for the elements H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Si, S and Fe. Collisional ionisation and recombination, photoionisation and charge-exchange reactions are included, and ion-by-ion non-equilibrium radiative cooling is calculated based on the instantaneous ion fractions of each element. Element and ion mass-fractions are advected using passive scalars, operator-split from the microphysical processes. The module is validated by comparing with equilibrium and non-equilibrium calculations in the literature. Effects of charge exchange on ion abundances in cooling plasmas are discussed. Application to modelling shocks and photoionised H~\textsc{ii} regions is demonstrated. The time-dependent expansion of a Wolf-Rayet nebula is studied, including photoionisation and collisional processes, and spectral-line luminosities calculated for non-equilibrium and equilibrium plasma states. The multi-ion module enables simulation of ionised plasmas with spatially varying elemental abundances using self-consistent ion abundances and thermal evolution. This allows prediction of spectral lines in UV, optical, IR and X-ray even in cases where the plasma is out of ionisation equilibrium.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we explored late-time cosmology within an extended class of theories based on $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity. This theory generalizes $f(Q)$ gravity by incorporating a non-minimal coupling between the non-metricity $Q$ and the matter Lagrangian $L_m$, analogous to the $f(Q,T)$ theory. The coupling between $Q$ and $L_m$ leads to the non-conservation of the matter energy-momentum tensor. We first investigated a cosmological model defined by the functional form $f(Q, L_m) = \alpha Q + \beta L_m^n$, where $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $n$ are constants. The derived Hubble parameter $H(z) = H_0 (1+z)^{\frac{3n}{2(2n-1)}}$ indicates that $n$ significantly influences the scaling of $H(z)$ over cosmic history, with $n > 2$ suggesting accelerated expansion. We also examined the simplified case of $n = 1$, leading to the linear form $f(Q, L_m) = \alpha Q + \beta L_m$, consistent with a universe dominated by non-relativistic matter. Using various observational datasets, including $H(z)$ and Pantheon, we constrained the model parameters. Our analysis showed that the $f(Q, L_m)$ model aligns well with observational results and exhibits similar behavior to the $\Lambda$CDM model. The results, with $q_0 = -0.22 \pm 0.01$ across all datasets, indicate an accelerating universe, highlighting the model's potential as an alternative to $\Lambda$CDM.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of core-collapse supernovae revealed that the existence of dense circumstellar matter (CSM) around their progenitors is ubiquitous. Interaction of supernova ejecta with such a dense CSM is a potential production sight of high-energy cosmic rays (CRs), gamma-rays, and neutrinos. We estimate the gamma-ray and neutrino signals from SN 2023ixf, a core-collapse supernova occurred in a nearby galaxy M101, which exhibits signatures of the interaction with the confined dense CSM. Using radiation-hydrodynamic simulation model calibrated by the optical and ultraviolet observations of SN 2023ixf, we find that the CRs cannot be accelerated in the early phase because the sharp velocity jump at the shock disappears due to strong radiation pressure. Roughly 4 days after the explosion, the collisionless sub-shock is formed in the CSM, which enables the CR production and leads to gamma-ray and neutrino emissions. The shock sweeps up the entire dense CSM roughly 9 days after the explosion, which ceases the high-energy radiation. Based on this scenario, we calculate the gamma-ray and neutrino signals, which have a peak around 9 days after the explosion. We can constrain the cosmic-ray production efficiency to be less than 30\% by comparing our prediction to the Fermi-LAT data. Future multi-messenger observations with an enlarged sample of nearby supernovae will provide a better constraint on the cosmic-ray production efficiency in the early phases of supernovae.

          The erosion of large primary atmospheres typically leaves behind substantial secondary atmospheres on temperate rocky planets

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanet exploration has revealed that many$\unicode{x2013}$perhaps most$\unicode{x2013}$terrestrial exoplanets formed with substantial H$_2$-rich envelopes, seemingly in contrast to solar system terrestrials, for which there is scant evidence of long-lived primary atmospheres. It is not known how a long-lived primary atmosphere might affect the subsequent habitability prospects of terrestrial exoplanets. Here, we present a new, self-consistent evolutionary model of the transition from primary to secondary atmospheres. The model incorporates all Fe-C-O-H-bearing species and simulates magma ocean solidification, radiative-convective climate, thermal escape, and mantle redox evolution. For our illustrative example TRAPPIST-1, our model strongly favors atmosphere retention for the habitable zone planet TRAPPIST-1e. In contrast, the same model predicts a comparatively thin atmosphere for the Venus-analog TRAPPIST-1b, which would be vulnerable to complete erosion via non-thermal escape and is consistent with JWST observations. More broadly, we conclude that the erosion of primary atmospheres typically does not preclude surface habitability, and frequently results in large surface water inventories due to the reduction of FeO by H$_2$.
