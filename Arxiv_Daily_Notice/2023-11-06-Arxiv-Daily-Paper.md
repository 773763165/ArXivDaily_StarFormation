 - **Abstract**
 We propose the use of group convolutional neural network architectures (GCNNs) equivariant to the 2D Euclidean group, $E(2)$, for the task of galaxy morphology classification by utilizing symmetries of the data present in galaxy images as an inductive bias in the architecture. We conduct robustness studies by introducing artificial perturbations via Poisson noise insertion and one-pixel adversarial attacks to simulate the effects of limited observational capabilities. We train, validate, and test GCNNs equivariant to discrete subgroups of $E(2)$ - the cyclic and dihedral groups of order $N$ - on the Galaxy10 DECals dataset and find that GCNNs achieve higher classification accuracy and are consistently more robust than their non-equivariant counterparts, with an architecture equivariant to the group $D_{16}$ achieving a $95.52 \pm 0.18\%$ test-set accuracy. We also find that the model loses $<6\%$ accuracy on a $50\%$-noise dataset and all GCNNs are less susceptible to one-pixel perturbations than an identically constructed CNN. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/snehjp2/GCNNMorphology.

 - **Abstract**
 We study gauge preheating following pseudoscalar-driven inflation in full general relativity. We implement the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura (BSSN) scheme to solve the full nonlinear evolution of the metric alongside the dynamics of the pseudoscalar and gauge fields. The dynamics of the background and emission of gravitational waves are broadly consistent with simulations in a Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime. We find large, localized overdensities in the BSSN simulations of order $\delta = \delta\rho/\rho \sim 30$, and the dimensionless power spectrum of $\delta$ peaks above unity. These overdense regions are seeded on length scales only slightly smaller than the horizon, and have a compactness $C \sim 0.1$. The scale of peak compactness is shorter than the Jeans length, which implies that pressure of the matter fields plays an important role in the evolution of these objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Inhomogeneous cloud formation and wavelength-dependent phenomena are expected to shape hot Jupiter atmospheres. We present a General Circulation Model (GCM) with multiwavelength "picket fence" radiative transfer and radiatively active, temperature dependent clouds, and compare the results to a double gray routine. The double gray method inherently fails to model polychromatic effects in hot Jupiter atmospheres, while picket fence captures these non-gray aspects and performs well compared to fully wavelength-dependent methods. We compare both methods with radiatively active clouds and cloud-free models, assessing the limitations of the double gray method. Although there are broad similarities, the picket fence models have larger day-night side temperature differences, non-isothermal upper atmospheres, and multiwavelength effects in the presence of radiatively active clouds. We model the well-known hot Jupiters HD 189733 b and HD 209458 b. For the hotter HD 209458 b, the picket fence method prevents clouds from thermostating dayside temperatures, resulting in hotter upper atmospheres and the dissipation of dayside clouds. Differences in the temperature structures are then associated with nuanced differences in the circulation patterns and clouds. Models of the cooler HD 189733 b have global cloud coverage, regardless of radiative transfer scheme, whereas there are larger differences in the models of HD 209458 b, particularly in the extent of the partial cloud coverage on its dayside. This results in minor changes to the thermal and reflected light phase curves of HD 189733 b, but more significant differences for the picket fence and double gray versions of HD 209458 b.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the serendipitous discovery of VVV-WIT-12, an unusual variable source that seems to induce variability in its surrounding nebula. The source belongs to the rare objects that we call WITs (short for What Is This?) discovered within the VISTA Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea (VVV) survey. VVV-WIT-12 was discovered during a pilot search for light echoes from distant Supernovae (SNe) in the Milky Way using the near-IR images of the VVV survey. This source has an extremely red spectral energy distribution, consistent with a very reddened ($A_V \sim 100$ mag) long period variable star ($P\sim1525$ days). Furthermore, it is enshrouded in a nebula that changes brightness and color with time, apparently in synch with the central source variations. The near-IR light curve and complementary follow-up spectroscopy observations are consistent with a variable Young Stellar Object (YSO) illuminating its surrounding nebula. In this case the source periodic variation along the cycles produces an unprecedented light echo in the different regions of the nebula.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for satellites around exoplanets represents one of the greatest challenges in advancing the characterization of planetary systems. Currently, we can only detect massive satellites, which resemble additional planetary companions rather than rocky moons. It is not yet well understood whether such substellar pairs, known as binary planets, are common or how they form. In this study, we investigated the formation scenario for binary planets resulting from tidal dissipation during close encounters in the gravitational instability scenario. We conducted seven sets of simulations, varying the number of initial planets injected into the system from two to five, as well as the amount of energy lost due to tides. Our results demonstrate that this formation mechanism is quite efficient in producing binary planets, with an average occurrence rate for the simulated systems of 14.3%. Additionally, we present the distribution of relevant physical parameters (semi-major axis, eccentricity, mass ratios, and formation time) for planet-planet pairs. We also provide comprehensive statistics for single planets and planet-planet pairs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present numerical characterizations of the wavefront sensing performance for few-mode photonic lantern wavefront sensors (PLWFSs). These characterizations include calculations of throughput, control space, sensor linearity, and an estimate of maximum linear reconstruction range for standard and hybrid lanterns with 3 to 19 ports, at a wavelength of 1550 nm. We additionally consider the impact of beam-shaping optics and a charge-1 vortex mask, placed in the pupil plane. The former is motivated by the application of PLs to high-resolution spectroscopy, which could enable efficient injection into the spectrometer along with simultaneous focal-plane wavefront sensing; similarly, the latter is motivated by the application of PLs to vortex fiber nulling (VFN), which can simultaneously enable wavefront sensing and the nulling of on-axis starlight. Overall, we find that the PLWFS setups tested in this work exhibit good linearity out to ~0.25-0.5 radians of RMS wavefront error (WFE). Meanwhile, we estimate the maximum amount of WFE that can be handled by these sensors, before the sensor response becomes degenerate, to be around ~1-2 radians RMS. In the future, we expect these limits can be pushed further by increasing the number of degrees of freedom, either by adopting higher-mode-count lanterns, dispersing lantern outputs, or separating polarizations. Lastly, we consider optimization strategies for the design of the PLWFS, which involve both modification of the lantern itself and the use of pre- and post-lantern optics like phase masks and interferometric beam recombiners.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are one of the most promising transient events for studying multi-wavelength observations in extreme conditions. Observation of GeV photons from bursts would provide crucial information on GRB physics, including the off-axis emission. The Second Gamma-ray Burst Catalog (2FLGC) was announced by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) Collaboration. This catalog includes 29 bursts with photon energy higher than 10 GeV. While the synchrotron forward-shock model has well explained the afterglow data of GRBs, photon energies greater than 10 GeV are very difficult to interpret within this framework. To study the spectral and temporal indices of those bursts described in 2FLGC, Fraija et al. (2022a) proposed the closure relations (CRs) of the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emitted from an on-axis jet which decelerates in stellar-wind and the constant-density medium. In this paper, we extend the CRs of the SSC afterglow from an on-axis scenario to an off-axis, including the synchrotron afterglow radiation that seems off-axis. In order to investigate the spectral and temporal index evolution of those bursts reported in 2FLGC, we consider the hydrodynamical evolution with energy injection in the adiabatic and radiative regime for an electron distribution with a spectral index of $1<p<2$ and $2 < p$. The results show that the most likely scenario for synchrotron emission corresponds to the stellar wind whether or not there is energy injection and that the most likely scenario for SSC emission corresponds to the constant density when there is no energy injection and to the stellar wind when there is energy injection.

 - **Abstract**
 The second {\itshape Fermi}/LAT gamma-ray burst (GRB) catalog (2FLGC) spanning the first decade of operations by the LAT collaboration was recently released. The closure relations of the synchrotron forward shock (FS) model are not able to reproduce a sizeable portion of the afterglow-phase light curves in this collection, indicating that there may be a large contribution from some other mechanism. Recently, synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) light curves from the reverse shock (RS) regions were derived in the thick- and thin-shell regime for a constant-density medium, and it was demonstrated that analytical light curves could explain the~GeV flare observed in several bursts from 2FLGC, including GRB 160509A. Here, we generalise the SSC RS scenario from the constant density to a stratified medium, and show that this contribution helps to describe the early light curves exhibited in some {\itshape Fermi}/LAT-detected bursts. As a particular case, we model a sample of eight bursts that exhibited a short-lasting emission with the synchrotron and SSC model from FS and RS regions, evolving in a stellar-wind environment, constraining the microphysical parameters, the circumburst density, the bulk Lorentz factor, and the fraction of shock-accelerated electrons. We demonstrate that the highest-energy photons can only be described by the SSC from the forward-shock region.

 - **Abstract**
 The peptide-like molecules, cyanoformamide (NCCONH2), is the cyano (CN) derivative of formamide (NH2CHO). It is known to play a role in the synthesis of nucleic acid precursors under prebiotic conditions. In this paper, we present a tentative detection of NCCONH2 in the interstellar medium (ISM) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) archive data. Ten unblended lines of NCCONH2 were seen around 3sigma noise levels toward Sagittarius B2(N1E), a position that is slightly offset from the continuum peak. The column density of NCCONH2 was estimated to be 2.4\times 10^15 cm ^-2, and the fractional abundance of NCCONH2 toward Sgr B2(N1E) was 6.9\times10^-10. The abundance ratio between NCCONH2 and NH2CHO is estimated to be ~0.01. We also searched for other peptide-like molecules toward Sgr B2(N1E). The abundances of NH2CHO, CH3NCO and CH3NHCHO toward Sgr B2(N1E) were about one tenth of those toward Sgr B2(N1S), while the abundances of CH3CONH2 was only one twentieth of that toward Sgr B2(N1S).

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first time measurement of X-ray polarization in the 2$-$8 keV band from the high synchrotron peaked (HSP) blazar 1ES 1959+650. The low energy hump in the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of blazars in the log$\nu$ versus $\nu F_{\nu}$ plane is believed to be due to the synchrotron emission process from relativistic particles in their jets. In HSP blazars, the observed X-ray emission lies in the high energy tail of the synchrotron part of the SED, and X-ray polarization measurements can constrain the processes by which particles are accelerated in their jets. We present here our results on the X-ray polarization characteristics of 1ES 1959+650 using observations carried out by the {\it Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE)}. {\it IXPE} observed this source for four epochs between May 2022 and August 2023, with observation time ranging from about 50 to 300 ksec. Of the four epochs of observations, we detected polarization on two epochs, significantly larger than the minimum detectable polarization values. From model-independent analysis during the observations on 28 October 2022, in the 2$-$8 keV band, we found the degree of polarization of $\Pi_X$ = 9.0 $\pm$ 1.6 \% and an electric vector position angle of $\psi_X$ = 53 $\pm$ 5 deg. Similarly, from the observations on 14 August 2023, we found $\Pi_X$ and $\psi_X$ values as 12.5 $\pm$ 0.7 \% and 20 $\pm$ 2 deg respectively in the 2$-$8 keV band. These values obtained from model-independent analysis are also in agreement with the values obtained from spectro-polarimetric analysis of the I, Q, and U spectra in the 2$-$8 keV range. The measured X-ray polarization is larger than that known in the optical that ranges between 2.5$-$9\% during the period 2008 to 2018. This result can be inferred as the shock acceleration of the particles in the jet of 1ES 1959+650.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we introduce the software package ProPane, written for the R data analysis language. ProPane combines the full range of wcslib projections with the C++ image manipulation routines provided by the CImg library. ProPane offers routines for image warping and combining (including stacking), and various related tasks such as image alignment tweaking and pixel masking. It can stack an effectively unlimited number of target frames using multiple parallel cores, and offers threading for many lower level routines. It has been used for a number of current and upcoming large surveys, and we present a range of its capabilities and features. ProPane is already available under a permissive open-source LGPL-3 license at github.com/asgr/ProPane (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.10057053).
#### Gravity- and temperature-driven phase transitions in a model for  collapsed axionic condensates

 - **Abstract**
 We show how to use the cubic-quintic Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equation (cq-GPPE) and the cubic-quintic Stochastic Ginzburg-Landau-Poisson equation (cq-SGLPE) to investigate the gravitational collapse of a tenuous axionic gas into a collapsed axionic condensate for both zero and finite temperature $T$. At $T=0$, we use a Gaussian Ansatz for a spherically symmetric density to obtain parameter regimes in which we might expect to find compact axionic condensates. We then go beyond this Ansatz, by using the cq-SGLPE to investigate the dependence of the axionic condensate on the gravitational strength $G$ at $T = 0$. We demonstrate that, as $G$ increases, the equilibrium configuration goes from a tenuous axionic gas, to flat sheets or $\textit{Zeldovich pancakes}$, cylindrical structures, and finally a spherical axionic condensate. By varying $G$, we show that there are first-order phase transitions, as the system goes from one of these structures to the next one; we find hysteresis loops that are associated with these transitions. We examine these states and the transitions between these states via the Fourier truncated cq-GPPE; and we also obtain the thermalized $T > 0$ states from the cq-SGLPE; the transitions between these states yield thermally driven first-order phase transitions and their associated hysteresis loops. Finally, we discuss how our cq-GPPE approach can be used to follow the spatiotemporal evolution of a rotating axionic condensate and also a rotating binary-axionic-condensate system; in particular, we demonstrate, in the former, the emergence of vortices at large angular speeds $\Omega$ and, in the latter, the rich dynamics of the mergers of the components of this binary system, which can yield vortices in the process of merging.
#### Relaxing cosmological constraints on current neutrino masses

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01803
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01803
 - **Abstract**
 We show that a mass-varying neutrino model driven by scalar field dark energy relaxes the existing upper bound on the current neutrino mass to ${\sum m_\nu < 0.72}$ eV. We extend the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by introducing two parameters: the rate of change of the scalar field with the number of $e$-folds and the coupling between neutrinos and the field. We investigate how they affect the matter power spectrum, the CMB anisotropies and its lensing potential. The model is tested against Planck observations of temperature, polarization, and lensing, combined with BAO measurements that constrain the background evolution. The results indicate that small couplings favor a cosmological constant, while larger couplings favor a dynamical dark energy, weakening the upper bound on current neutrino masses.

 - **Abstract**
 A relevant fraction of massive stars are runaway stars. These stars move with a significant peculiar velocity with respect to their environment. We aim to discover and characterize the population of massive and early-type runaway stars in the GOSC and BeSS catalogs using Gaia DR3 astrometric data. We present a 2-dimensional method in the velocity space to discover runaway stars as those that deviate significantly from the velocity distribution of field stars, which are considered to follow the Galactic rotation curve. We found 106 O runaway stars, 42 of which were not previously identified as runaways. We found 69 Be runaway stars, 47 of which were not previously identified as runaways. The dispersion of runaway stars is a few times higher in Z and b than that of field stars. This is explained by the ejections they underwent when they became runaways. The percentage of runaways is 25.4% for O-type stars, and it is 5.2% for Be-type stars. In addition, we conducted simulations in 3 dimensions for our catalogs. They revealed that these percentages could increase to ~30% and ~6.7%, respectively. Our runaway stars include seven X-ray binaries and one gamma-ray binary. Moreover, we obtain velocity dispersions of ~5 km/s perpendicular to the Galactic plane for O- and Be-type field stars. These values increase in the Galactic plane to ~7 km/s for O-type stars due to uncertainties and to ~9 km/s for Be-type stars due to Galactic velocity diffusion. The excellent Gaia DR3 astrometric data have allowed us to identify a significant number of O-type and Be-type runaways in the GOSC and BeSS catalogs. The higher percentages and higher velocities found for O-type compared to Be-type runaways underline that the dynamical ejection scenario is more likely than the binary supernova scenario. Our results open the door to identifying new high-energy systems among our runaways by conducting detailed studies.
#### Fermi-LAT detection of the supernova remnant G312.4-0.4 in the vicinity  of 4FGL J1409.1-6121e

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray emission provides constraints on the non-thermal radiation processes at play in astrophysical particle accelerators. This allows both the nature of accelerated particles and the maximum energy that they can reach to be determined. Notably, it remains an open question to what extent supernova remnants (SNRs) contribute to the sea of Galactic cosmic rays. In the Galactic plane, at around 312{\deg} of Galactic longitude, Fermi-LAT observations show an extended source (4FGL J1409.1-6121e) around five powerful pulsars. This source is described by one large disk of 0.7{\deg} radius with a high significance of 45 sigma in the 4FGL-DR3 catalog. Using 14 years of Fermi-LAT observations, we revisited this region with a detailed spectro-morphological analysis in order to disentangle its underlying structure. Three sources have been distinguished, including the supernova remnant G312.4-0.4 whose gamma-ray emission correlates well with the shell observed at radio energies. The hard spectrum detected by the LAT, extending up to 100 GeV without any sign of cut-off, is well reproduced by a purely hadronic model.

 - **Abstract**
 We have received a new physical characteristics fitting based on actual observational data from the Swift mission's long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). We considered such characteristics as the Amati parameters for linear correlation ($E_\text{iso}-E_{\text{p},i}$) and the $k$-correction for gravitational lensing and Malmquist bias (GLMB) effect. We used the Pantheon SN Ia catalogue and the standard $\Lambda$CDM model with a fixed Hubble constant of $H_0=70$ km/s/Mpc as the baseline for the Hubble function $\mu(z)$. In our paper, we formulated the inverse cosmological calibration problem (ICCP) in the non-parametric statistics framework. The ICCP involves fitting non-observable physical characteristics while assuming a fixed cosmological model. To solve this problem, we developed a new method that is resistant to non-Gaussian processes. This method is based on error propagation through the Monte Carlo method and the Theil-Sen method for linear regression estimate. We have demonstrated the stability and robustness of this assessment method. The parameter estimates are as follows: $a=0.92^{+0.12}_{-0.12}$, $b=50.32^{+0.33}_{-0.32}$ without considering the GLMB effect, and $a=0.63^{+0.13}_{-0.14}$, $b=50.12^{+0.33}_{-0.31}$, and $k=1.98^{+0.25}_{-0.24}$ with the effect included. The proposed method can be applied to any other calibration sample of known standard candles, a calibrated sample of LGRBs, and the Hubble function $\mu(z)$. In the future, the ICCP idea can be used as an alternative cosmological test for estimating cosmological parameters, including the GLMB effect, or even for the selection of models, providing new information about the Universe. This can be done by analysing the residual values of observational data within the Bayesian statistics paradigm.

 - **Abstract**
 The "chromosome maps" (ChMs) of globular clusters (GCs) have revealed that these ancient structures are not homogeneous in metallicity in various ways, and in different natures. The Type II GCs generally display larger variations, sometimes coupled with slow neutron capture (s) element enrichment on the ChMs redder sequences, which has been interpreted as due to multiple generations of stars. On the other hand, most GCs have inhomogeneous first populations (1P) in the form of large ranges in the Delta(F275W,F814W) values, pointing towards a not fully mixed pristine molecular cloud. We analyse the chemical composition the GC 47 Tucanae, which shows both inhomogeneous 1P stars and, although not formally a Type II GC, hosts a small number of stars distributed on a red side of the main stream of ChM stars. Our results suggest that 1P stars are not homogeneous in the overall metallicity, with variations of the order of ~0.10 dex in all the chemical species. The anomalous stars distributed on a redder sequence of the ChM, are further enriched in metals, but without any evidence for a significant enrichment in the s elements. Our three second population stars located on the normal component of the map, have metallicities similar to those of the metal-richer 1P group, suggesting that this population formed from these stars. Although three stars is a too-small sample to draw strong conclusions, the low spread in metals of these objects might point towards a formation in a fully mixed medium, possibly after a cooling flow phase.

 This is a brief, non-exhaustive review of Fast Radio Burst (FRB), a new category of radio transients originating from extragalactic distances. We discuss the key observational properties known so far and the scientific applications of FRBs. We summarize the FRB-related research in the French astrophysics community, and conclude by sharing some insights to the future of FRB science.

 - **Abstract**
 A growing planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk induces three-dimensional gas flow, which exhibits a midplane outflow that can suppress dust accretion onto the planet and form global dust substructures (rings and gaps). Because analytic formulae for the planet-induced outflow are useful for modeling its influences on local and global dust surface densities and planet accretion, we derive the analytic formulae that describe the morphology and velocity of the planet-induced outflow. We first perform three-dimensional, nonisothermal hydrodynamical simulations of the gas flow past a planet, which enables us to introduce a fitting formula describing the morphology of the outflow. We then derive an analytic formula for the outflow speed using Bernoulli's theorem. We successfully derived a fitting formula for the midplane outflow morphology (the shape of the streamline), which is valid when the dimensionless thermal mass falls below $m\lesssim0.6$. The obtained analytic formulae for the outflow, such as the maximum outflow speed and the velocity distributions of the outflow in the radial and vertical directions to the disk, show good agreement with the numerical results. We find the following trends: (1) the maximum outflow speed increases with the planetary mass and has a peak of $\sim$30--40$\%$ of the sound speed when the dimensionless thermal mass is $m\sim0.3$, corresponding to a super-Earth mass planet at 1 au for the typical steady accretion disk model, and (2) the presence of the headwind (namely, the global pressure force acting in the positive radial direction of the disk) enhances (reduces) the outflow toward the outside (inside) of the planetary orbit. The planet-induced outflow of the gas affects the dust motion when the dimensionless stopping time of dust falls below ${\rm St}\lesssim\min(10m^2,0.1)$.

 - **Abstract**
 The NASA's Double-Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) was a unique planetary defence and technology test mission, the first of its kind. The main spacecraft of the DART mission impacted the target asteroid Dimorphos, a small moon orbiting asteroid (65803) Didymos, on 2022 September 26. The impact brought up a mass of ejecta which, together with the direct momentum transfer from the collision, caused an orbital period change of 33 +/- 1 minutes, as measured by ground-based observations. We report here the outcome of the optical monitoring campaign of the Didymos system from the Danish 1.54 m telescope at La Silla around the time of impact. The observations contributed to the determination of the changes in the orbital parameters of the Didymos-Dimorphos system, as reported by arXiv:2303.02077, but in this paper we focus on the ejecta produced by the DART impact. We present photometric measurements from which we remove the contribution from the Didymos-Dimorphos system using a H-G photometric model. Using two photometric apertures we determine the fading rate of the ejecta to be 0.115 +/- 0.003 mag/d (in a 2" aperture) and 0.086 +/- 0.003 mag/d (5") over the first week post-impact. After about 8 days post-impact we note the fading slows down to 0.057 +/- 0.003 mag/d (2" aperture) and 0.068 +/- 0.002 mag/d (5"). We include deep-stacked images of the system to illustrate the ejecta evolution during the first 18 days, noting the emergence of dust tails formed from ejecta pushed in the anti-solar direction, and measuring the extent of the particles ejected sunward to be at least 4000 km.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine gravitational waves (GWs) emitted from axionic strings and domain walls (DWs) in the early universe using advanced 3D lattice simulations. Our study encompasses scenarios for domain wall numbers $N_{\rm DW}=1$ and $N_{\rm DW}>1$, which correspond to GWs primarily from strings and DWs, respectively. Simulations begin before the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) phase transition and conclude with the destruction of string-wall networks below the QCD energy scale, relevant to both QCD axions and axion-like particles (ALPs). For $N_{\rm DW}=1$, the GW energy density from axion strings appears undetectable for both QCD axions and ALPs. In contrast, for $N_{\rm DW}>1$, the GW spectrum is largely determined by the bias term's coefficient, with the QCD axion model predicting undetectable GW emissions, while the ALPs model allows for a detectable GW signal in the nano-Hertz to the kilo-Hertz frequency range.

 - **Abstract**
 Large and deep depressions, also known as pits, are observed at the surface of all Jupiter Family Comets (JFCs) imaged by spacecraft missions. They offer the opportunity to glimpse into sub-surface characteristics of comet nuclei, and study the complex interplay between surface structures and cometary activity. This work investigates the evolution of pits at the surface of 81P/Wild 2, 9P/Tempel 1 and 103P/Hartley 2, in continuation of the work by Benseguane et al. (2022), on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Pits are selected across the surface of each nucleus, and high-resolution shape models are used to compute the energy they receive. A thermal evolution model is applied to constrain how cometary activity sustained under current illumination conditions could modify them. Similarly to what was found for 67P, we show erosion resulting from water-driven activity is primarily controlled by seasonal patterns, unique to each comet as a consequence of their shape and rotational properties. However, progressive erosion sustained after multiple perihelion passages is not able to carve any of the observed pits. Instead, cometary activity tends to erase sharp morphological features: they become wider and shallower over time. Our results reinforce the evolutionary sequence evidenced from independent measurables to transform "young" cometary surfaces, with sharp surface topography prone to outbursts, into "old" cometary surfaces. Finally, we suggest that the mechanism at the origin of pits on JFCs should be able to carve these structures in a region of the solar system where water ice does not sublimate: the Centaur phase thus appears critical to understand JFCs surface properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Axion-like particles (ALPs) are a well-motivated dark matter candidate that solve some of the problems in the clustering of large scale structure in cosmology. ALPs are often described by a simplified quadratic potential to specify the dynamics of the axion field, and are included in cosmological analysis codes using a modified fluid prescription. In this paper we consider the extreme axion: a version of the axion with a high initial field angle that produces an enhancement (rather than a suppression) of structure on small scales around the Jeans length, which can be probed by measurements of clustering such as the eBOSS DR14 Ly-$\alpha$ forest. We present a novel method of modeling the extreme axion as a cosmological fluid, combining the Generalized Dark Matter model with the effective fluid approach presented in the \texttt{axionCAMB} software, as well as implementing a series of computational innovations to efficiently simulate the extreme axions. We find that for axion masses between $10^{-23} \text{ eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-22.5} \text{ eV}$, constraints on the axion fraction imposed by the eBOSS DR14 Ly-$\alpha$ forest can be significantly weakened by allowing them to be in the form of extreme axions with a starting angle between $\pi - 10^{-1} \lesssim \theta_0 \lesssim \pi - 10^{-2}$. This work motivates and enables a more robust hydrodynamical analysis of extreme axions in order to compare them to high-resolution Ly-$\alpha$ forest data in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamic astrophysical phenomena are predominantly described by differential equations, yet our understanding of these systems is constrained by our incomplete grasp of non-linear physics and scarcity of comprehensive datasets. As such, advancing techniques in solving non-linear inverse problems becomes pivotal to addressing numerous outstanding questions in the field. In particular, modeling hot galactic winds is difficult because of unknown structure for various physical terms, and the lack of \textit{any} kinematic observational data. Additionally, the flow equations contain singularities that lead to numerical instability, making parameter sweeps non-trivial. We leverage differentiable programming, which enables neural networks to be embedded as individual terms within the governing coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and show that this method can adeptly learn hidden physics. We robustly discern the structure of a mass-loading function which captures the physical effects of cloud destruction and entrainment into the hot superwind. Within a supervised learning framework, we formulate our loss function anchored on the astrophysical entropy ($K \propto P/\rho^{5/3}$). Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, even in the absence of kinematic data $v$. We then apply these models to real Chandra X-Ray observations of starburst galaxy M82, providing the first systematic description of mass-loading within the superwind. This work further highlights neural ODEs as a useful discovery tool with mechanistic interpretability in non-linear inverse problems. We make our code public at this GitHub repository (https://github.com/dustindnguyen/2023_NeurIPS_NeuralODEs_M82).
#### Physical properties of the eclipsing binary KIC 9851944 and analysis of  its tidally-perturbed p- and g-mode pulsations

 - **Abstract**
 Stars that are both pulsating and eclipsing offer an important opportunity to better understand many of the physical phenomena that occur in stars, because it is possible to measure the pulsation frequencies of stars for which the masses and radii are known precisely and accurately. KIC 9851944 is a double-lined detached eclipsing binary containing two F-stars which show both pressure and gravity mode pulsations. We present an analysis of new high-resolution spectroscopy of the system and high quality light curves from the Kepler and TESS space missions. We determine the masses and effective temperatures of the stars to 0.6% precision, and their radii to 1.0% and 1.5% precision. The secondary component is cooler, but larger and more massive than the primary so is more evolved; both lie inside the {\delta} Scuti and {\gamma} Doradus instability strips. We measure a total of 133 significant pulsation frequencies in the light curve, including 14 multiplets that each contain between 3 and 19 frequencies. We find evidence for tidal perturbations to some of the p- and g-modes, attribute a subset of the frequencies to either the primary or secondary star, and measure a buoyancy radius and near-core rotational frequency for the primary component. KIC 9851944 is mildly metal-rich and MIST isochrones from the MESA evolutionary code agree well with the observed properties of the system for an age of 1.25 Gyr.
