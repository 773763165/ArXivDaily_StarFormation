 - **Abstract**
 Context. Comets are small celestial bodies made of ice, dust, and rock that orbit the Sun. Understanding their behavior as they warm up at perihelion unveils many pieces of information about the interior and general morphology of the ices hidden under the dust. Aims. The goal of this research is to study the sublimation of CH4 through amorphous solid water (ASW), with a focus on the structural changes in water and the influence of a layer of indene (as a proxy of the crust) during a period of thermal processing, which we use in a controlled laboratory setting to simulate cometary environments. Methods. Ices at a CH4 to H2O abundance ratio of about 0.01 are deposited and layered, or co-deposited, at 30 K and are heated until 200 K (or 140 K) with a ramp of either 1 or 5 K per min. We use mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy to analyze the results. Results. Depending on the heating ramp and type of deposition, the sublimation of methane through ASW varies, being lower in intensity and higher in temperature when the co-deposited structure is considered. When two temperature cycles are applied, the second one sees less intense CH4 desorptions. When indene is placed above the ice mixtures, we find that the thicker its layer, the later the methane desorption. Conclusions. The structural changes of water ice drive volatile and hyper-volatile desorption because of the transition from high to low intrinsic density and transformation from amorphous to crystalline. This desorption indicates that such material has been deposited at low temperatures in agreement with previous theories on cometary ices formed in the pre-stellar cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Using near-infrared observations of Neptune from the Keck and Lick Observatories, and the Hubble Space Telescope in combination with amateur datasets, we calculated the drift rates of prominent infrared-bright cloud features on Neptune between 2018 and 2021. These features had lifespans of $\sim 1$ day to $\geq$1 month and were located at mid-latitudes and near the south pole. Our observations permitted determination of drift rates via feature tracking. These drift rates were compared to three zonal wind profiles describing Neptune's atmosphere determined from features tracked in H band (1.6 $\mu m$), K' band (2.1 $\mu m$), and Voyager 2 data at visible wavelengths. Features near $-70 \deg$ measured in the F845M filter (845nm) were particularly consistent with the K' wind profile. The southern mid-latitudes hosted multiple features whose lifespans were $\geq$1 month, providing evidence that these latitudes are a region of high stability in Neptune's atmosphere. We also used HST F467M (467nm) data to analyze a dark, circumpolar wave at $- 60 \deg$ latitude observed on Neptune since the Voyager 2 era. Its drift rate in recent years (2019-2021) is $4.866 \pm 0.009 \deg $/day. This is consistent with previous measurements by Karkoschka (2011), which predict a $4.858 \pm 0.022 \deg$/day drift rate during these years. It also gained a complementary bright band just to the north.

 - **Abstract**
 It remains to be ascertained whether sub-Neptune exoplanets primarily possess hydrogen-rich atmospheres or whether a population of H$_2$O-rich "water worlds" lurks in their midst. Addressing this question requires improved modeling of water-rich exoplanetary atmospheres, both to predict and interpret spectroscopic observations and to serve as upper boundary conditions on interior structure calculations. Here we present new models of hydrogen-helium-water atmospheres with water abundances ranging from solar to 100% water vapor. We improve upon previous models of high water content atmospheres by incorporating updated prescriptions for water self-broadening and a non-ideal gas equation of state. Our model grid (https://umd.box.com/v/water-worlds) includes temperature-pressure profiles in radiative-convective equilibrium, along with their associated transmission and thermal emission spectra. We find that our model updates primarily act at high pressures, significantly impacting bottom-of-atmosphere temperatures, with implications for the accuracy of interior structure calculations. Upper atmosphere conditions and spectroscopic observables are less impacted by our model updates, and we find that under most conditions, retrieval codes built for hot Jupiters should also perform well on water-rich planets. We additionally quantify the observational degeneracies among both thermal emission and transmission spectra. We recover standard degeneracies with clouds and mean molecular weight for transmission spectra, and we find thermal emission spectra to be more readily distinguishable from one another in the water-poor (i.e. near-solar) regime.

 - **Abstract**
 The star-forming region W5 is a major part of the Cassiopeia OB6 association. Its internal structure and kinematics may provide hints of the star formation process in this region. Here, we present a kinematic study of young stars in W5 using the Gaia data and our radial velocity data. A total 490 out of 2,000 young stars are confirmed as members. Their spatial distribution shows that W5 is highly substructured. We identify a total of eight groups using the k-means clustering algorithm. There are three dense groups in the cavities of H II bubbles, and the other five sparse groups are distributed at the ridge of the bubbles. The three dense groups have almost the same ages (5 Myr) and show a pattern of expansion. The scale of their expansion is not large enough to account for the overall structure of W5. The three northern groups are, in fact, 3 Myr younger than the dense groups, which indicates the independent star formation events. Only one group of them shows the signature of feedback-driven star formation as its members move away from the eastern dense group. The other two groups might have formed in a spontaneous way. On the other hand, the properties of two southern groups are not understood as those of a coeval population. Their origins can be explained by dynamical ejection of stars and multiple star formation. Our results suggest that the substructures in W5 formed through multiple star-forming events in a giant molecular cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova (SN) 1987A is the nearest supernova in $\sim$400 years. Using the {\em JWST} MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph, we spatially resolved the ejecta, equatorial ring (ER) and outer rings in the mid-infrared 12,927 days after the explosion. The spectra are rich in line and dust continuum emission, both in the ejecta and the ring. Broad emission lines (280-380~km~s$^{-1}$ FWHM) seen from all singly-ionized species originate from the expanding ER, with properties consistent with dense post-shock cooling gas. Narrower emission lines (100-170~km~s$^{-1}$ FWHM) are seen from species originating from a more extended lower-density component whose high ionization may have been produced by shocks progressing through the ER, or by the UV radiation pulse associated with the original supernova event. The asymmetric east-west dust emission in the ER has continued to fade, with constant temperature, signifying a reduction in dust mass. Small grains in the ER are preferentially destroyed, with larger grains from the progenitor surviving the transition from SN into SNR. The ER is fit with a single set of optical constants, eliminating the need for a secondary featureless hot dust component. We find several broad ejecta emission lines from [Ne~{\sc ii}], [Ar~{\sc ii}], [Fe~{\sc ii}], and [Ni~{\sc ii}]. With the exception of [Fe~{\sc ii}]~25.99$\mu$m, these all originate from the ejecta close to the ring and are likely being excited by X-rays from the interaction. The [Fe~{\sc ii}]~5.34$\mu$m to 25.99$\mu$m line ratio indicates a temperature of only a few hundred K in the inner core, consistent with being powered by ${}^{44}$Ti decay.
#### TOI-4201: An Early M-dwarf Hosting a Massive Transiting Jupiter  Stretching Theories of Core-Accretion

 - **Abstract**
 We confirm TOI-4201 b as a transiting Jovian mass planet orbiting an early M dwarf discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. Using ground based photometry and precise radial velocities from NEID and the Planet Finder Spectrograph, we measure a planet mass of 2.59$^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ M$_{J}$, making this one of the most massive planets transiting an M-dwarf. The planet is $\sim$0.4\% the mass of its 0.63 M$_{\odot}$ host and may have a heavy element mass comparable to the total dust mass contained in a typical Class II disk. TOI-4201 b stretches our understanding of core-accretion during the protoplanetary phase, and the disk mass budget, necessitating giant planet formation to either take place much earlier in the disk lifetime, or perhaps through alternative mechanisms like gravitational instability.

 - **Abstract**
 The European Open Science Cloud aims to make all data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. By far the largest community of users of the European Open Science Cloud is the science-inclined public. These users need a more curated experience of open science than subject specialists, but nevertheless make very substantial research contributions in open science, especially in crowdsourced data mining, i.e. citizen science. This short, non-technical invited review presents applications of citizen science in the European Open Science Cloud, with a particular focus on astrophysics and astroparticle physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are transient events with a high energy and short duration in the radio frequency. By identifying the origin of the pulse, it is possible to measure the redshift of the host galaxy, which can be used to constrain cosmological and astrophysical parameters and test aspects of fundamental physics when combined with the observed dispersion measure ($DM$). However, some factors limit the application of FRBs in cosmology: (i) the current poor modelling of the fluctuations in the $DM$ due to spatial variation in the cosmic electrons density; (ii) the fact that the fraction of baryon mass in the intergalactic medium ($f_{IGM}$) is degenerated with some cosmological parameters; (iii) the limited current knowledge about host galaxy contribution ($DM_{host}$). In this work, we investigate the impact of different redshift distribution models of FRBs to constrain the baryon fraction in the IGM and host galaxy contribution. We use a cosmological model-independent method developed in previous work \cite{Lemos2023} to perform the analysis and combine simulated FRB data from Monte Carlo simulation and supernovae data. Since the physical mechanism responsible for the burst is still unknown, we assume four distribution models for the FRBs, namely gamma-ray bursts (GRB), star formation rate (SFR), uniform and equidistant (ED). Also, we consider samples with $N = 15$, 30, 100 and 500 points and three different values of the fluctuations of electron density in the $DM$, $\delta = 0, 10, 100$ pc/cm$^{3}$. Our analysis shows that the GRB, SFR and Uniform distribution models present consistent results within $2\sigma$ for the free parameters $f_{IGM}$ and $DM_{host,0}$ and highlights the crucial role of $DM$ fluctuations in obtaining more precise measurements.
