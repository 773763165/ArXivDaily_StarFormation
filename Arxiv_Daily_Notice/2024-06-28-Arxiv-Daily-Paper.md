          HATS-38 b and WASP-139 b join a growing group of eccentric hot Neptunes on polar orbits

 - **Abstract**
 We constrain the sky-projected obliquities of two low-density hot Neptune planets HATS-38 b and WASP-139 b orbiting nearby G and K stars using Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) observations with VLT/ESPRESSO, yielding $\lambda = -108_{-16}^{+11}$ deg and $-85.6_{-4.2}^{+7.7}$ deg, respectively. To model the RM effect, we use a new publicly available code, \texttt{ironman}, which is capable of jointly fitting transit photometry, Keplerian radial velocities, and RM effects. The two planets have residual eccentricities ($e= 0.112_{-0.070}^{+0.072}$, and $0.103_{-0.041}^{+0.050}$, respectively), and together with the obliquity constraints, we show that they join a growing group of eccentric hot and low-density Neptunes on polar orbits. We use long-term radial velocities to rule out companions with masses $\sim 0.3-50$ $M_J$ within $\sim$10 au. We show that the orbital architectures of the two Neptunes disfavor an origin from primordial disk misalignment and/or in-situ secular interactions with distant companions and instead favor high-eccentricity migration from $\gtrsim 2$ au driven by a distant companion. Finally, we performed a hierarchical Bayesian modeling of the true obliquity distribution of Neptunes and found suggestive evidence for a higher preponderance of polar orbits of hot Neptunes compared to Jupiters. However, we note that the exact distribution is sensitive to the choice of priors, highlighting the need for additional obliquity measurements of Neptunes to robustly compare the hot Neptune obliquity distribution to Jupiters.

 - **Abstract**
 Over a quarter of white dwarfs have photospheric metal pollution, which is evidence for recent accretion of exoplanetary material. While a wide range of mechanisms have been proposed to account for this pollution, there are currently few observational constraints to differentiate between them. To investigate the driving mechanism, we observe a sample of polluted and non-polluted white dwarfs in wide binary systems with main-sequence stars. Using the companion stars' metallicities as a proxy for the white dwarfs' primordial metallicities, we compare the metallicities of polluted and non-polluted systems. Because there is a well-known correlation between giant planet occurrence and higher metallicity (with a stronger correlation for close-in and eccentric planets), these metallicity distributions can be used to probe the role of gas giants in white dwarf accretion. We find that the metallicity distributions of polluted and non-polluted systems are consistent with the hypothesis that both samples have the same underlying metallicity distribution. However, we note that this result is likely biased by several selection effects. Additionally, we find no significant trend between white dwarf accretion rates and metallicity. These findings suggest that giant planets are not the dominant cause of white dwarf accretion events in binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Roughly 2% of white dwarfs harbor planetary debris disks detectable via infrared excesses, but only a few percent of these disks show a gaseous component, distinguished by their double-peaked emission at the near-infrared calcium triplet. Previous studies found most debris disks around white dwarfs are variable at 3.4 and 4.5 $\mu$m, but they analyzed only a few of the now 21 published disks showing calcium emission. To test if most published calcium emission disks exhibit large-amplitude stochastic variability in the near-infrared, we use light curves generated from the unWISE images at 3.4 $\mu$m that are corrected for proper motion to characterize the near-infrared variability of these disks against samples of disks without calcium emission, highly variable cataclysmic variables, and 3215 isolated white dwarfs. We find most calcium emission disks are extremely variable: 6/11 with sufficient signal-to-noise show high-amplitude variability in their 3.4-$\mu$m light curves. These results lend further credence to the notion that disks showing gaseous debris in emission are the most collisionally active. Under the assumption that 3.4-$\mu$m variability is characteristic of white dwarfs with dusty debris disks, we generate a catalog of 104 high-confidence near-infrared variable white dwarfs, 84 of which are published as variable for the first time. We do near-infrared spectroscopic follow-up of seven new candidate 3.4-$\mu$m variables, confirming at least one new remnant planetary system, and posit that empirical near-infrared variability can be a discovery engine for debris disks showing gaseous emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiplanetary systems spanning the radius valley are ideal testing grounds for exploring the proposed explanations for the observed bimodality in the radius distribution of close-in exoplanets. One such system is HIP 29442 (TOI-469), an evolved K0V star hosting two super-Earths and a sub-Neptune. We observe HIP 29442 with CHEOPS for a total of 9.6 days, which we model jointly with 2 sectors of TESS data to derive planetary radii of $3.410\pm0.046$, $1.551\pm0.045$ and $1.538\pm0.049$ R$_\oplus$ for planets b, c and d, which orbit HIP 29442 with periods of 13.6, 3.5 and 6.4 days. For planet d, this value deviates by more than 3 sigma from the median value reported in the discovery paper, leading us to conclude that caution is required when using TESS photometry to determine the radii of small planets with low per-transit S/N and large gaps between observations. Given the high precision of these new radii, combining them with published RVs from ESPRESSO and HIRES provides us with ideal conditions to investigate the internal structure and formation pathways of the planets in the system. We introduce the publicly available code plaNETic, a fast and robust neural network-based Bayesian internal structure modelling framework. We then apply hydrodynamic models to explore the upper atmospheric properties of these inferred structures. Finally, we identify planetary system analogues in a synthetic population generated with the Bern model for planet formation and evolution. Based on this analysis, we find that the planets likely formed on opposing sides of the water iceline from a protoplanetary disk with an intermediate solid mass. We finally report that the observed parameters of the HIP 29442 system are compatible with both a scenario where the second peak in the bimodal radius distribution corresponds to sub-Neptunes with a pure H/He envelope as well as a scenario with water-rich sub-Neptunes.

 - **Abstract**
 The correction of quasi-static wavefront errors within a coronagraphic optical system will be a key challenge to overcome in order to directly image exoplanets in reflected light. These quasi-static errors are caused by mid to high-order surface errors on the optical elements as a result of manufacturing processes. Using high-order wavefront sensing and control (HOWFSC) techniques that do not introduce non-common path aberrations, the quasi-static errors can be corrected within the desired region of interest designated as the dark hole. For the future Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), HOWFSC algorithms will be key to attaining the desired contrasts. To simulate the performance of HOWFSC with space rated processors, optical models for a 6 m class space-borne observatory and a coronagraph have been developed. Phenomena such as the Talbot effect and beamwalk are included in the simulations using combinations of ray-based modeling and end-to-end propagation techniques. After integrating the optical models with the embedded processors, simulations with realistic computation times can be performed to understand the computational hardware performance that will be needed to maintain the desired contrasts. Here, the details of the optical models are presented along with the HOWFSC methods utilized. Initial results of the HOWFSC methods are also included as a demonstration of how system drifts will degrade the contrast and require dark hole maintenance.

 - **Abstract**
 We have analyzed high-dispersion spectra in the Li 6708 Angstrom region for 167 stars within the anticenter cluster, NGC 2204. From 105 probable members, abundance analysis of 45 evolved stars produces [Fe/H] = -0.40 +/- 0.12, [Si/Fe] = 0.14 +/- 0.12, [Ca/Fe] = 0.29 +/- 0.07, and [Ni/Fe] = -0.12 +/- 0.10, where quoted errors are standard deviations. With E(B-V) = 0.07 and (m-M)_0 = 13.12, appropriate isochrones provide an excellent match from the main sequence through the tip of the giant branch for an age of 1.85 +/- 0.05 Gyr. Li spectrum synthesis produces A(Li) below 1.4 at the base of the red giant branch to a detectable value of -0.4 at the tip. Six probable AGB stars and all but one red clump star have only Li upper limits. A rapidly rotating red giant is identified as a possible Li-rich giant, assuming it is a red clump star. Main sequence turnoff stars have a well-defined A(Li) = 2.83 +/- 0.03 (sem) down to the Li-dip wall at the predicted mass of 1.29 solar masses. Despite the same isochronal age as the more metal-rich NGC 2506, the red giant luminosity distribution reflects a younger morphology similar to NGC 7789, possibly indicating a deeper metallicity impact on stellar structure and A(Li) than previously assumed. As in NGC 2506 and NGC 7789, the NGC 2204 turnoff exhibits a broad range of rotation speeds, making abundance estimation impossible for some stars. The cluster place within Galactic A(Li) evolution is discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The pulsational mode of gravitational collapse (PMGC) originating from the combined gravito-electrostatic interaction in complex dust molecular clouds (DMCs) is a canonical mechanisms leading to the onset of astronomical structure formation dynamics. A semi-analytic generalized model is formulated to examine the collective effects of polarization force, Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity, and non-thermal (r, q)-distributed electrons on the stability of the PMGC concurrently. The ions are treated with the help of the Maxwellian thermo-statistical distribution law whereas the electrons are modelled with the non-thermal (r, q)-distribution law. The dust species including neutral and negatively charged particles are treated as fluids. A spherical normal mode analysis obtains a quartic linear dispersion relation for the PMGC. The oscillatory and propagation characteristics of the PMGC mode dynamics are investigated on a constructed numerical platform. It found that an increase in the polarization force and positive EiBI parameter significantly enhances the instability resulting in the DMC collapse, and vice versa. The electron non-thermality spectral parameters play a vital role as stabilizing factor. Its reliability and applicability are finally outlined in light of the previous astronomical studies in the same thematic direction.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. High frame-rate imaging was employed to mitigate the effects of atmospheric turbulence (seeing) in observations of globular cluster Terzan 5. Aims. High-precision time-series photometry has been obtained with the highest angular resolution so far taken in the crowded central region of Terzan 5, with ground-based telescopes, and ways to avoid saturation of the brightest stars in the field observed. Methods. The Electron-Multiplying Charge Coupled Device (EMCCD) camera installed at the Danish 1.54-m telescope at the ESO La Silla Observatory was employed to produce thousands of short-exposure time images (ten images per second) that were stacked to produce the normal-exposure-time images (minutes). We employed difference image analysis in the stacked images to produce high-precision photometry using the DanDIA pipeline. Results. Light curves of 1670 stars with 242 epochs were analyzed in the crowded central region of Terzan 5 to statistically detect variable stars in the field observed. We present a possible visual counterpart outburst at the position of the pulsar J1748-2446N, and the visual counterpart light curve of the low-mass X-ray binary CX 3. Additionally, we present the discovery of 4 semiregular variables. We also present updated ephemerides and properties of the only RR Lyrae star previously known in the field covered by our observations in Terzan 5. Finally, we report a significant displacement of two sources by ~0.62 and 0.59 arcseconds with respect to their positions in previous images available in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 Future X-ray astrophysics missions will survey large areas of the sky with unparalleled sensitivity, enabled by lightweight, high-resolution optics. These optics inherently produce curved focal surfaces with radii as small as 2 m, requiring a large area detector system that closely conforms to the curved focal surface. We have embarked on a project using a curved charge-coupled device (CCD) detector technology developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory to provide large-format, curved detectors for such missions, improving performance and simplifying design. We present the current status of this work, which aims to curve back-illuminated, large-format (5 cm x 4 cm) CCDs to 2.5-m radius and confirm X-ray performance. We detail the design of fixtures and the curving process, and present intial results on curving bare silicon samples and monitor devices and characterizing the surface geometric accuracy. The tests meet our accuracy requirement of <5 $\mu$m RMS surface non-conformance for samples of similar thickness to the functional detectors. We finally show X-ray performance measurements of planar CCDs that will serve as a baseline to evaluate the curved detectors. The detectors exhibit low noise, good charge-transfer efficiency, and excellent, uniform spectroscopic performance, including in the important soft X-ray band.

          Probing the cosmic web in Ly$\alpha$ emission over large scales: an Intensity Mapping forecast for DECaLS/BASS and DESI

 - **Abstract**
 Being the most prominent HI line, Ly$\alpha$ permeates the cosmic web in emission. Despite its potential as a cosmological probe, its detection on large scales remains elusive. We present a new methodology to perform Ly$\alpha$ intensity mapping with broad-band optical images, by cross-correlating them with Ly$\alpha$ forest data using a custom one-parameter estimator. We also develop an analytical large-scale Ly$\alpha$ emission model with two parameters (average luminosity $\langle L_{\rm Ly\alpha} \rangle$ and bias $b_{\rm e}$) that respects observational constraints from QSO luminosity functions. We compute a forecast for DECaLS/BASS $g$-band images cross-correlated with DESI Ly$\alpha$ forest data, setting guidelines for reducing images into Ly$\alpha$ intensity maps. Given the transversal scales of our cross-correlation (26.4 arcmin, $\sim$33 cMpc/h), our study effectively integrates Ly$\alpha$ emission over all the cosmic volume inside the DESI footprint at $2.2 < z < 3.4$ (the $g$-band Ly$\alpha$ redshift range). Over the parameter space ($\langle L_{\rm Ly\alpha} \rangle$, $b_{\rm e}$) sampled by our forecast, we find a 3$\sigma$ of large-scale structure in Ly$\alpha$ likely, with a probability of detection of 23.95\% for DESI-DECaLS/BASS, and 54.93\% for a hypothetical DESI phase II with twice as much Ly$\alpha$ QSOs. Without a detection, we derive upper bounds on $\langle L_{\rm Ly\alpha} \rangle$ competitive with optimistic literature estimates ($2.3 \pm 1 \cdot 10^{\rm 41}$ erg/s/cMpc$^3$ for DESI, and $\sim$35\% lower for its hypothetical phase II). Extrapolation to the DESI-Rubin overlap shows that a detection of large-scale structure with Ly$\alpha$ intensity mapping using next-generation imaging surveys is certain. [abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate D-term inflation within the framework of supergravity, employing the minimal Kahler potential. Our study reveals that this model can overcome the {\eta}-problem found in F-term models. Additionally, we explore reheating dynamics and gravitino production, emphasizing the interplay between reheating temperature, spectral index, and gravitino abundance. Our analysis indicates that gravitino production is sensitive to the equation of state during reheating, affecting the reheating temperature and subsequent dark matter relic density. Perturbation theory reveals that Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs) evolve according to second-order effects arising from first-order curvature perturbations. In fact, the spectral energy density of these waves is particularly relevant to Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations. Furthermore, we analyze gravitational waves generated by cosmic strings, providing critical constraints on early Universe dynamics and cosmic string properties. The dimensionless string tension significantly influences the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by cosmic strings post-inflation. Finally, the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by cosmic strings is influenced by the energy scales of inflation and string formation.

          Eccentricity and Inclination of Massive Planets Inside Low-density Cavities: Results of 3D Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We study the evolution of eccentricity and inclination of massive planets in low-density cavities of protoplanetary discs using three-dimensional (3D) simulations. When the planet's orbit is aligned with the equatorial plane of the disc, the eccentricity increases to high values of 0.7-0.9 due to the resonant interaction with the inner parts of the disc. For planets on inclined orbits, the eccentricity increases due to the Kozai-Lidov mechanism, where the disc acts as an external massive body that perturbs the planet's orbit. At small inclination angles, < 30 degrees, the resonant interaction with the inner disc strongly contributes to the eccentricity growth, while at larger angles, eccentricity growth is mainly due to the Kozai-Lidov mechanism. We conclude that planets inside low-density cavities tend to acquire high eccentricity if favorable conditions give sufficient time for growth. The final value of the planet's eccentricity, after the disc dispersal depends on the planet's mass and properties of the cavity and protoplanetary disc.

 - **Abstract**
 The Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB) is a high-contrast imaging testbed built to demonstrate starlight suppression techniques at visible wavelengths in a space-like vacuum environment. The testbed is designed to achieve ${<}10^{-8}$ contrast from $3-10\lambda/D$ in a one-sided dark hole using a liquid crystal vector vortex waveplate and a 952-actuator Kilo-C deformable mirror (DM) from Boston Micromachines (BMC). We have recently expanded the testbed to include a field stop for mitigation of stray/scattered light, a precision-fabricated pinhole in the source simulator, a Minus K passive vibration isolation table for jitter reduction, and a low-noise vacuum-compatible CMOS sensor. We report the latest contrast performance achieved using implicit electric field conjugation (iEFC) at a vacuum of ${\sim}10^{-6}$ Torr and over a range of bandpasses with central wavelengths from 500 to 650nm and bandwidths (BW) from $\ll 1\%$ to 15\%. Our jitter in vacuum is $<3\times10^{-3} \lambda/D$, and the best contrast performance to-date in a half-sided D-shaped dark hole is $2.2\times10^{-9}$ in a $\ll 1 \%$ BW, $4\times10^{-9}$ in a 2\% BW, and $2.5\times10^{-8}$ in a 15\% BW.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarization aberrations originating from the telescope and high-contrast imaging instrument optics introduce polarization-dependent speckles and associated errors in the image plane, affecting the measured exoplanet signal. Understanding this effect is critical for future space-based high-contrast imaging instruments that aim to image the Earth analogs with 1e-10 raw contrast and characterize their atmospheres. We present end-to-end modeling of the polarization aberrations for a high-contrast imaging testbed, SCoOB. We use a vector vortex coronagraph (VVC) as the focal plane mask, incorporate polarization filtering, and estimate the peak contrast in the dark hole region. The dominant polarization aberrations in the system are retardance defocus and tilt due to the OAPs and fold mirrors. Although the mean contrast in the dark hole region remains unaffected by the polarization aberrations, we see brighter speckles limiting the contrast to 1e-9 at smaller inner working angles. We extend the simulations using the measured retardance maps for the VVC. We find that the mean contrast in SCoOB is more sensitive to the VVC and the QWP retardance errors than the polarization aberrations.

 - **Abstract**
 The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is responsive to kinetic disruptions generated by nearby astrophysical events. In this work, we study the saturation and dissipation of turbulent hydrodynamics within the CGM through an extensive array of 252 numerical simulations with a large parameter space. These simulations are endowed with proper cooling mechanisms to consistently explore the parameter space spanned by the average gas density, metallicity, and turbulence driving strength. A dichotomy emerges in the dynamics dissipation behaviors. Disturbances that are hot and subsonic are characterized by weak compression and slow dissipation, resulting in density fluctuations typically $\lesssim 10^{-2}$. Conversely, warm supersonic turbulence, marked by significant compression shocks and subsequent rapid cooling, is associated with substantial clumping factors $\sim 10^0-10^1$. In the supersonic cases, the kinetic energy decay is divided into a rate-limiting phase of shock dissipation and a comparatively swift phase of thermal dissipation, predominantly occurring within the overdense regions. Upon turbulence driving turnoff, the strong density contrasts decay within a relatively brief timescale of $\sim 30 - 300~{\rm Myr}$, depending on the average gas density. Dense clouds are crushed on similar timescales of $ \sim 30 - 100 ~{\rm Myr} $, depending on turbulence driving strength but independent from average gas density. Results of this work also contribute a novel dataset of dissipation timescales that incorporates an understanding of kinematics and thermodynamics in addition to the traditional cooling rate tables, which may serve as a valuable asset for forthcoming simulations that aim to explore gas dynamics on galactic and cosmological scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Based on the Gaia DR3, we reconstructed the orbital evolution of the known Milky Way globular clusters and found that six objects, NGC 6681, NGC 6981, Palomar 6, NGC 6642, HP 1, and NGC 1904, very likely interact closely with the nuclear star cluster. Aims. We study the dynamical evolution of selected Milky Way globular clusters and their interactions with the Galactic centre over cosmological timescales. We examine the global dynamical mass loss of these globular cluster systems, their close interactions with the Galactic centre, and the potential capture of stars by the Milky Way nuclear star cluster. Methods. For the dynamical modelling of the clusters, we used the parallel N-body code phi-GPU, which allows star-by-star simulations of the systems. Our current code also enabled us to follow the stellar evolution of individual particles, including the formation of high-mass remnants. The modelling was carried out in a Milky Way-like, time-variable potential (with a dynamically changing mass and scale length), obtained from the IllustrisTNG-100 database, with a full integration time of eight billion years. Results. Based on extensive numerical modelling and analysis, we estimated the mass loss and the global and inner structures of the selected six clusters. Over an evolution of eight billion years, the clusters lost 80% of their initial mass. We analysed the phase-space evolution of the individual unbound stars NGC 6681, NGC 6642, HP 1, and NGC 1904. We found that only NGC 6642 could potentially have been a source for populating the Milky Way nuclear star cluster in the past.

 - **Abstract**
 A systematic, population-level discrepancy exists between the densities of exoplanets whose masses have been measured with transit timing variations (TTVs) versus those measured with radial velocities (RVs). Since the TTV planets are predominantly nearly resonant, it is still unclear whether the discrepancy is attributed to detection biases or to astrophysical differences between the nearly resonant and non resonant planet populations. We defined a controlled, unbiased sample of 36 sub-Neptunes characterised by Kepler, TESS, HARPS, and ESPRESSO. We found that their density depends mostly on the resonant state of the system, with a low probability (of $0.002_{-0.001}^{+0.010}$) that the mass of (nearly) resonant planets is drawn from the same underlying population as the bulk of sub-Neptunes. Increasing the sample to 133 sub-Neptunes reveals finer details: the densities of resonant planets are similar and lower than non-resonant planets, and both the mean and spread in density increase for planets that are away from resonance. This trend is also present in RV-characterised planets alone. In addition, TTVs and RVs have consistent density distributions for a given distance to resonance. We also show that systems closer to resonances tend to be more co-planar than their spread-out counterparts. These observational trends are also found in synthetic populations, where planets that survived in their original resonant configuration retain a lower density; whereas less compact systems have undergone post-disc giant collisions that increased the planet's density, while expanding their orbits. Our findings reinforce the claim that resonant systems are archetypes of planetary systems at their birth.

 - **Abstract**
 The digital correlator is one of the most crucial data processing components of a radio telescope array. With the scale of radio interferometeric array growing, many efforts have been devoted to developing a cost-effective and scalable correlator in the field of radio astronomy. In this paper, a 192-input digital correlator with six CASPER ROACH2 boards and seven GPU servers has been deployed as the digital signal processing system for Tianlai cylinder pathfinder located in Hongliuxia observatory. The correlator consists of 192 input signals (96 dual-polarization), 125-MHz bandwidth, and full-Stokes output. The correlator inherits the advantages of the CASPER system, for example, low cost, high performance, modular scalability, and a heterogeneous computing architecture. With a rapidly deployable ROACH2 digital sampling system, a commercially expandable 10 Gigabit switching network system, and a flexible upgradable GPU computing system, the correlator forms a low-cost and easily-upgradable system, poised to support scalable large-scale interferometeric array in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Future space observatories will likely have segmented primaries, causing diffraction effects that reduce coronagraph performance. Reflective binary pupil apodizer masks can mitigate these, with the metamaterial black silicon (BSi) showing promise as a strong absorber. To bring contrast ratios to the $10^-{10}$ level as needed to observe Earth-like exoplanets, feature sizes on these BSi masks will need to be less than $5$ microns when paired with MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems) deformable mirrors. As scalar diffraction cannot reliably model this feature size, we developed a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) model of BSi masks using Meep software. We characterize the FDTD-derived polarization-dependent bidirectional reflectance distribution function of BSi and discuss the model's shortcomings.

          Extended GeV $\gamma$-ray emission around the star forming region of the W3 complex

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the GeV $\gamma$-ray emission from the W3 complex using about 14 years of Pass 8 data recorded by the $\it Fermi$ Large Area Telescope (\textit{Fermi}-LAT). We resolve the $\gamma$-ray emissions around W3 into two components: an elliptical Gaussian overlapping with the molecular gas and a point-like source near the cluster W3 Main. The pion-bump feature of SED for the elliptical Gaussian together with the better fitting result of pion decay model favor the hadronic origin. We further argue that the cosmic rays (CRs) could originate from the interactions between cluster winds and the shock produced by the SNR HB3. The point-like source positionally coincident with the star cluster W3 Main indicates it may be directly powered by near clusters, while its fainter $\gamma$-ray emissions below 10 GeV is possibly due to the shelter from dense gas making the low-energy CRs incapable of penetrating the dense materials. Meanwhile, we cannot rule out that the $\gamma$-ray emissions originate from the interaction of accelerated protons in SNR with the ambient gas.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar evolution theories predict a gap in the black hole birth mass spectrum as the result of pair instability processes in the cores of massive stars. This gap, however, is not seen in the binary black hole masses inferred from gravitational wave data. One explanation is that black holes form dynamically in dense star clusters where smaller black holes merge to form more massive black holes, populating the mass gap. We show that this model predicts a distribution of the effective and precessing spin parameters, $\chi_{\rm eff}$ and $\chi_{\rm p}$, within the mass gap that is insensitive to assumptions about black hole natal spins. We analyze the distribution of $\chi_{\rm eff}$ as a function of primary mass for the black hole binaries in the third gravitational wave transient catalog. We infer the presence of a high-mass population of black holes that is consistent with hierarchical formation in dense star clusters. This population becomes dominant above $44^{+6}_{-4} M_\odot$, which we interpret as the lower edge of the pair-instability mass gap. Upcoming data will enable us to tightly constrain the hierarchical formation hypothesis and refine our understanding of binary black hole formation.

          Hybrid approach predicts a lower binding energy for benzene on water ice

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we provide a highly accurate value for the binding energy of benzene to proton-ordered crystalline water ice (XIh), as a model for interstellar ices. We compare our computed value to the latest experimental data available from temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and find that our binding energy value agrees well with data obtained from binding to either crystalline or amorphous ice. Importantly, our new value is lower than that used in most astrochemical networks by about nearly half its value. We explore the impact of this revised binding energy value for both an AGB outflow and a protoplanetary disk. We find that the lower value of the binding energy predicted here compared with values used in the literature (4050 K versus 7587 K) leads to less depletion of gas-phase benzene in an AGB outflow, and leads to a shift outwards in the benzene snowline in the midplane of a protoplanetary disk. Using this new value, the AGB model predicts lower abundances of benzene in the solid phase throughout the outflow. The disk model also predicts a larger reservoir of gas-phase benzene in the inner disk, which is consistent with the recent detections of benzene for the first time in protoplanetary disks with JWST.

          Stability of the Potential Super Jupiter in Alpha Centauri System

 - **Abstract**
 The stability of potential exoplanets in binary star systems remains a critical challenge in celestial mechanics. This study investigates the stability of a hypothetical Jupiter-mass planet in the Alpha Centauri AB system by drawing parallels with the recently detected Neptune-mass planet in the GJ65AB system, which shares similar mass ratios and orbital eccentricities. Utilizing the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem and the Mean Exponential Growth of Nearby Orbits (MEGNO) parameter within the REBOUND software package, we perform numerical simulations to identify stable orbital configurations. Our results indicate that a Jupiter-mass planet could theoretically maintain a stable orbit in Alpha Centauri AB, with orbital parameters derived from the stable zones observed in GJ65AB. Despite the absence of observational evidence for such a planet in Alpha Centauri AB, this study suggests that similar binary systems could exhibit analogous stability characteristics. Future observational efforts are recommended to explore this potential and refine our understanding of planetary formation in binary star systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The free electron model with Boltzmann statistics for spherical low-density plasmas is developed further with asymptotic relations obtaining the density of electrons, mass densities, and the potentials of such plasmas. Solutions are developed as function of a pure number proportional to the distance from the stellar plasma center (galaxy center) with extremely small coefficient, so that these solutions are essentially functions of large astronomical distances and masses. The present plasma is divided into a central part and very long tail, where the central part of the plasma shows an exponential dependence on the distance from the galaxy center, but a part of the large mass of this plasma is included in the long stellar plasma tail. The present model is specialized to completely ionized Hydrogen plasma (with a small correction factor considering its mixture with heavier atoms) where emission and absorption of spectral lines can be neglected in the warm low density stellar plasma. We apply the present approach for treating rotation curves measurements, A general theory for rotation curves should include the superposition of the gravitational potentials introduced by the high-density compact stars, with those of the low-density stellar plasma potentials. But for halos which are at extremely large distance from the galaxy center, the dominant effects would be those of dark matter, and such dark halos are permeating and surrounding the compact galactic stars. Such plasma is found to be transparent in most of the EM spectrum. The existence of a large mass for the warm low-density plasma may solve the problem of missing mass in rotation curves measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 We have investigated the behaviour of three strong near-infrared diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) at {\lambda}13177 Å, {\lambda}14680 Å, and {\lambda}15272 Å, on a larger sample of sightlines and over a wider range of extinctions than previously studied, utilizing spectra from three observatories. We applied two telluric correction techniques to reduce atmospheric contamination and have used Gaussian fits to characterise the DIB profiles and measure equivalent widths. We confirmed strong and approximately linear correlations with reddening of the {\lambda}13177 Å, {\lambda}14680 Å and {\lambda}15272 Å DIBs, extending them to higher reddening values and strengthening their link to interstellar matter. Modelling of the {\lambda}14680 Å DIB profiles revealed intrinsic variations, including line broadening, linked to their formation processes. This effect is particularly pronounced in the Galactic Centre (GC) environment, where multiple diffuse molecular clouds along the line of sight contribute to line broadening. We have detected one new DIB candidate at {\lambda}14795 Å on sightlines with high reddening.

          X-ray and gamma-ray study for 2023 nova eruption of V1716 Sco

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of X-ray and gamma-ray analyses of the nova V1716 Sco taken by Swift, NICER, NuSTAR and F ermi-LAT. We have detected gamma-ray emission at a significant level exceeding 8 {\sigma} in daily bins starting the day after the optical eruption. The gamma-ray emission, characterized by a Test Statistic (TS) value more than four, persisted for approximately 40 days. Notably, harder X-ray emission were observed by NuSTAR as the start of gamma-ray emission, which is the fourth classical nova that gamma-ray emission is concurrent with harder X-ray emission from NuSTAR data. V1716 Sco is one of rare samples that clearly shows a hard X-ray emission (1-10 keV bands) in the Swift-XRT data concurrently with gamma-ray emission of Fermi-LAT data, and its light curve in 1.0-10.0 keV bands had a peak at about 20 days after the optical eruption. The X-ray spectrum was initially fitted by a model of thermal plasma emission, and entered a supersoft phase with additional blackbody (BB) component emerged around about 40 days after the optical eruption. NICER data taken in supersoft source phase revealed a quasi-periodic oscillation with a period of 79.10+-1.98 seconds, and the peak phase of the folded light curve varied with time. Moreover, V1716 Sco is the another example that the emission radius in supersoft source phase is significantly larger than the radius of white dwarf, and a simple BB emission model may not be applicable since the luminosity exceeds significantly Eddington limit.

          Interacting ultralight dark matter and dark energy and fits to cosmological data in a field theory approach

 - **Abstract**
 The description of dark matter as a pressure-less fluid and of dark energy as a cosmological constant, both minimally coupled to gravity, constitutes the basis of the concordance $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ model. However, the concordance model is based on using equations of motion directly for the fluids with constraints placed on their sources, and lacks an underlying Lagrangian. In this work, we propose a Lagrangian model of two spin zero fields describing dark energy and dark matter with an interaction term between the two along with self-interactions. We study the background evolution of the fields as well as their linear perturbations, suggesting an alternative to $\Lambda$CDM with dark matter and dark energy being fundamental dynamical fields. The parameters of the model are extracted using a Bayesian inference tool based on multiple cosmological data sets which include those of Planck (with lensing), BAO, Pantheon, SH0ES, and WiggleZ. Using these data, we set constraints on the dark matter mass and the interaction strengths. Furthermore, we find that the model is able to alleviate the Hubble tension for some data sets while also resolving the $S_8$ tension.

          M31 nucleus: molecular and ionised gas content upper limits

 - **Abstract**
 We report NOEMA and ALMA observations of the nucleus of Andromeda (M31), putting strong constraints on the presence of gas in the form of cold or warm phase, as proposed by Chang et al. M31 hosts the largest supermassive black hole (SMBH) closer than 1 Mpc from us. Its nucleus is silent with some murmurs at the level of 4 10$^{-9}$ L$_{Edd}$, and is surrounded by a 5-pc-radius disk of old stars. The mass-loss from these stars is expected to fill a molecular gas disk within the tidal truncation of 1 pc (0.26"), of 10$^4$ Mo, corresponding to a CO(1-0) signal of 2mJy with a linewidth of 1000km/s. We observed the nucleus with NOEMA in CO(2-1) and with ALMA in CO(3-2) with angular resolutions of 0.5" (1.9 pc) and 0.12" (0.46 pc) respectively. We exclude the presence of gas with a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 195 Mo. The CO(3-2) upper limit also constrains warm gas, escaping detection in CO(1-0). The scenario proposed by Chang et al. is not verified, and instead the hot gas, expelled by the stellar winds, might never cool nor fall onto the disc. Alternatively, the stellar wind mass-loss rate can have been overestimated by a factor 50, and/or the ionised gas escaped from the nucleus. The SMBH in M31 is obviously in a low state of activity, similar to what is observed for Sgr A* in the Milky Way (MW). Recently, a cool (10$^4$ K) ionised accretion disc has been detected around Sgr A* in the H30$\alpha$ recombination line with ALMA. Re-scaling sizes, masses and fluxes according to the mass of M31's black hole (35 times higher than in the MW) and the distances, a similar disc could be easily detectable around M31 nucleus with an expected signal 8 times weaker that the signal detected in SgrA*. We searched for an ionised gas disc around M31 nucleus with NOEMA, and put a 3$\sigma$ upper limit on the H30$\alpha$ recombination line at a level twice lower than expected with a simple scaling of the SgrA*.

          The AMS-02 cosmic ray deuteron flux is consistent with a secondary origin

 - **Abstract**
 The recent measurements of cosmic ray deuteron fluxes by AMS-02 show that the rigidity dependence of deuterons is similar with that of protons but flatter than $^3$He, which has been attributed to the existence of primary deuterons with abundance much higher than that from the Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The requirement of highly deuteron-abundant sources imposes a serious challenge on the modern astrophysics since there is no known process to produce a large amount of deuterons without violating other constraints \cite{1976Natur.263..198E}. In this work we demonstrate that the fragmentation of heavy nuclei up to iron plays a crucial role in shaping/enhancing the spectrum/flux of the cosmic ray deuterons. Based on the latest cosmic ray data, the predicted secondary fluxes of deuterons and $^3$He are found to be reasonably consistent with the AMS-02 measurements and a primary deuteron component is not needed. The apparent difference between D/$^4$He (D/p) and $^3$He/$^4$He ($^3$He/p) is probably due to a combined effect of the kinetic-energy-to-rigidity conversion and the solar modulation. More precise measurements of the fragmentation cross sections of various nuclei to produce deuterons, tritons, and $^3$He in a wide energy range will be very helpful in further testing the secondary origin of cosmic ray deuterons.

 We study the effects of superfluid dark matter on the structure of a cosmic string wake, considering both the effects of regular and quantum pressure terms. We consider the total fluid to consist of a combination of baryons and dark matter. Hence, we are also able to study the effects of superfluid dark matter on the distribution of baryons inside the wake. We focus on parameter values for the superfluid dark matter which allow a MONDian explanation of galaxy rotation curves.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroids with diameters less than about 5 km have complex histories because they are small enough for radiative torques, YORP, to be a notable factor in their evolution. (152830) Dinkinesh is a small asteroid orbiting the Sun near the inner edge of the Main Asteroid Belt with a heliocentric semimajor axis of 2.19 AU; its S type spectrum is typical of bodies in this part of the Main Belt. Here we report observations by the Lucy spacecraft as it passed within 431 km of Dinkinesh. Lucy revealed Dinkinesh, which has an effective diameter of only $\sim$720 m, to be unexpectedly complex. Of particular note is the presence of a prominent longitudinal trough overlain by a substantial equatorial ridge, and the discovery of the first confirmed contact binary satellite, now named (152830) Dinkinesh I Selam. Selam consists of two near-equal sized lobes with diameters of $\sim$210 m and $\sim$230 m. It orbits Dinkinesh at a distance of 3.1 km with an orbital period of about 52.7 hr, and is tidally locked. The dynamical state, angular momentum, and geomorphologic observations of the system lead us to infer that the ridge and trough of Dinkinesh are probably the result of mass failure resulting from spin-up by YORP followed by the partial reaccretion of the shed material. Selam probably accreted from material shed by this event.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive neural architecture, the PUREPath, which leverages a nested Probabilistic multi-modal U- Net framework, augmented by the inclusion of probabilistic ResNet blocks in the Expanding Pathway of the decoders, to estimate the posterior density of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) signal conditioned on the observed CMB data and the training dataset. By seamlessly integrating Bayesian statistics and variational methods our model effectively minimizes foreground contamination in the observed CMB maps. The model is trained using foreground and noise contaminated CMB temperature maps simulated at Planck LFI and HFI frequency channels 30 - 353 GHz using publicly available Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background (CAMB) and Python Sky Model (PySM) packages. During training, our model transforms initial prior distribution on the model parameters to posterior distributions based on the training data. From the joint full posterior of the model parameters, during inference, a predicitve CMB posterior and summary statistics such as the predictive mean, variance etc of the cleaned CMB map is estimated. The predictive standard deviation map provides a direct and interpretable measure of uncertainty per pixel in the predicted mean CMB map. The cleaned CMB map along with the error estimates can be used for more accurate measurements of cosmological parameters and other cosmological analyses.
