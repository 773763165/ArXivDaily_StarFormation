 - **Abstract**
 We present the first detection of 13CCH in a protoplanetary disk (TW Hya). Using observations of C2H we measure CCH/13CCH = 65 +/- 20 in gas with a CO isotopic ratio of 12CO/13CO = 21 +/- 5 (Yoshida et al. 2022a). The TW Hya disk exhibits a gas phase C/O that exceeds unity and C2H is the tracer of this excess carbon. We confirm that the TW Hya gaseous disk exhibits two separate carbon isotopic reservoirs as noted previously (Yoshida et al. 2022a). We explore two theoretical solutions for the development of this dichotomy. One model represents TW Hya today with a protoplanetary disk exposed to a cosmic ray ionization rate that is below interstellar as consistent with current estimates. We find that this model does not have sufficient ionization in cold (T < 40 K) layers to activate carbon isotopic fractionation. The second model investigates a younger TW Hya protostellar disk exposed to an interstellar cosmic ray ionization rate. We find that the younger model has sources of ionization deeper in a colder disk that generates two independent isotopic reservoirs. One reservoir is 12C-enriched carried by methane/hydrocarbon ices and the other is 13C-enriched carried by gaseous CO. The former potentially provides a source of methane/hydrocarbon ices to power the chemistry that generates the anomalously strong C$_2$H emission in this (and other) disk systems in later stages. The latter provides a source of gaseous 13C-rich material to generate isotopic enrichments in forming giant planets as recently detected in the super-Jupiter TYC 8998-760-1 b by Zhang et al. (2021).

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Citizen Science program Active Asteroids and describe discoveries stemming from our ongoing project. Our NASA Partner program is hosted on the Zooniverse online platform and launched on 2021 August 31, with the goal of engaging the community in the search for active asteroids -- asteroids with comet-like tails or comae. We also set out to identify other unusual active solar system objects, such as active Centaurs, active quasi-Hilda asteroids, and Jupiter-family comets (JFCs). Active objects are rare in large part because they are difficult to identify, so we ask volunteers to assist us in searching for active bodies in our collection of millions of images of known minor planets. We produced these cutout images with our project pipeline that makes use of publicly available Dark Energy Camera (DECam) data. Since the project launch, roughly 8,300 volunteers have scrutinized some 430,000 images to great effect, which we describe in this work. In total we have identified previously unknown activity on 15 asteroids, plus one Centaur, that were thought to be asteroidal (i.e., inactive). Of the asteroids, we classify four as active quasi-Hilda asteroids, seven as JFCs, and four as active asteroids, consisting of one Main-belt comet (MBC) and three MBC candidates. We also include our findings concerning known active objects that our program facilitated, an unanticipated avenue of scientific discovery. These include discovering activity occurring during an orbital epoch for which objects were not known to be active, and the reclassification of objects based on our dynamical analyses.
#### TRANSLIENT: Detecting Transients Resulting from Point Source Motion or  Astrometric Errors

 - **Abstract**
 Detection of moving sources over complicated background is important for several reasons. First is measuring the astrophysical motion of the source. Second is that such motion resulting from atmospheric scintillation, color refraction, or astrophysical reasons is a major source of false alarms for image subtraction methods. We extend the Zackay, Ofek, and Gal-Yam image subtraction formalism to deal with moving sources. The new method, named translient (translational transient) detector, applies hypothesis testing between the hypothesis that the source is stationary and that the source is moving. It can be used to detect source motion or to distinguish between stellar variability and motion. For moving source detection, we show the superiority of translient over the proper image subtraction, using the improvement in the receiver-operating characteristic curve. We show that in the small translation limit, Translient is an optimal detector of point source motion in any direction. Furthermore, it is numerically stable, fast to calculate, and presented in a closed form. Efficient transient detection requires both the proper image subtraction statistics and the translient statistics: when the translient statistic is higher, then the subtraction artifact is likely due to motion. We test our algorithm both on simulated data and on real images obtained by the Large Array Survey Telescope (LAST). We demonstrate the ability of translient to distinguish between motion and variability, which has the potential to reduce the number of false alarms in transients detection. We provide the translient implementation in Python and MATLAB.
#### Stellar Mergers or Truly Young? Intermediate-Age Stars on Highly-Radial  Orbits in the Milky Way's Stellar Halo

 - **Abstract**
 Reconstructing the mass assembly history of the Milky Way relies on obtaining detailed measurements of the properties of many stars in the Galaxy, especially in the stellar halo. One of the most constraining quantities is stellar age, as it can shed light on the accretion time and quenching of star formation in merging satellites. However, obtaining reliable age estimates for large samples of halo stars is difficult. We report published ages of 120 subgiant halo stars with highly-radial orbits that likely belong to the debris of the $Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage$ (GES) galaxy. The majority of these halo stars are old, with an age distribution characterized by a median of 11.6~Gyr and 16$^{\rm th}$(84$^{\rm th}$) percentile of 10.5~(12.7)~Gyr. However, the distribution is skewed, with a tail of younger stars that span ages down to $\sim6$-$9$ Gyr. All highly-radial halo stars have chemical and kinematic/orbital quantities that associate them with the GES debris. Initial results suggest that these intermediate-age stars are not a product of mass transfer and/or stellar mergers, which can bias their age determination low. If this conclusion is upheld by upcoming spectro-photometric studies, then the presence of these stars will pose an important challenge for constraining the properties of the GES merger and the accretion history of the Galaxy.
#### Estimating the Absolute Parameters of W UMa-type Binary Stars Using Gaia  DR3 Parallax

 - **Abstract**
 The accuracy of absolute parameters' estimation in contact binary systems is important for investigating their evolution and solving some challenges. The Gaia DR3 parallax is one of the methods used for estimating the absolute parameters, in cases where photometric data is the only one that is available. The use of this method includes advantages and limitations that we have described and examined in this study. We selected 48 contact binary systems whose mass ratios were mostly obtained by spectroscopic data, in addition to a number of photometric studies. The target systems were suitable for A_V and the Re-normalised Unit Weight Error (RUWE), and their absolute parameters were calculated based on Gaia DR3 parallax, observational information, orbital period, and light cure solution from the literature and catalogs. The outcomes of OO Aql differed significantly from those reported in the literature. Upon analyzing the system's light curve with TESS data, we concluded that the stars' temperatures were the reason for this difference, and utilizing Gaia DR3 parallax provided reasonable results. We displayed the target systems on the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR), q-L_ratio, P-M_V, and logM_tot-logJ_0 diagrams, and the systems are in good agreement with the theoretical fits. We showed that the estimation of absolute parameters with this method might be acceptable if Delta a(R_Sun) is less than about 0.1(R_Sun). There are open questions regarding the existence of l_3 in the light curve analysis and its effect on the estimation of absolute parameters with this method.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar age measurements are fundamental to understanding a wide range of astronomical processes, including galactic dynamics, stellar evolution, and planetary system formation. However, extracting age information from Main Sequence stars is complicated, with techniques often relying on age proxies in the absence of direct measurements. The Gaia data releases have enabled detailed studies of the dynamical properties of stars within the Milky Way, offering new opportunities to understand the relationship between stellar age and dynamics. In this study, we leverage high-precision astrometric data from Gaia DR3 to construct a stellar age prediction model based only on stellar dynamical properties; namely, the vertical action. We calibrate two distinct, hierarchical stellar age--vertical action relations, first employing asteroseismic ages for red giant branch stars, then isochrone ages for main-sequence turn-off stars. We describe a framework called "zoomies" based on this calibration, by which we can infer ages for any star given its vertical action. This tool is open-source and intended for community use. We compare dynamical age estimates from "zoomies" with ages derived from other techniques for a sample of open clusters and main-sequence stars with asteroseismic age measurements. We also compare dynamical age estimates for stellar samples from the Kepler, K2, and TESS exoplanet transit surveys. While dynamical age relations are associated with large uncertainty, they are generally mass-independent and depend on homogeneously measured astrometric data. These age predictions are uniquely useful for large-scale demographic investigations, especially in disentangling the relationship between planet occurrence, metallicity, and age for low-mass stars.
#### Rapid hydrofracture of icy moon shells: insights from glaciology

 - **Abstract**
 Europa's surface features many regions of complex topography termed 'chaos terrains'. One set of hypotheses for chaos terrain formation require upward migration of liquid water from perched water bodies formed by convection and tidal heating within the icy shell. However, consideration of the behaviour of terrestrial ice sheets suggests the rapid downwards, not upwards, movement of water from perched water bodies, initiated through hydrofracture and without a propagation limit provided there is a sufficient volume of water to fill the resulting vertical fracture. I suggest that drainage of perched water bodies to the subsurface ocean through hydrofracture is a likely phenomenon at Europa and other icy moons. This may at first appear to rule out perched water bodies in the formation of chaos areas, but the violence of such drainage events and loss of mechanical support could lead to the collapse of the surface shell and a temporary surface-ocean connection. Alternatively, hydrofracture provides a mechanism for entire ice-shell fracture if a surface impact melts enough near-surface ice.

 - **Abstract**
 Few laboratory studies have investigated the vapor pressures of the volatiles that may be present as ices in the outer solar system; even fewer studies have investigated these species at the temperatures and pressures suitable to the surfaces of icy bodies in the Saturnian and Uranian systems ($\lt$100 K, $\lt10^{-9}$ bar). This study adds to the work of Grundy et al. (2024) in extending the known equilibrium vapor pressures of outer solar system ices through laboratory investigations at very low temperatures. Our experiments with ammonia and oxygen ices provide new thermodynamic models for these species' respective enthalpies of sublimation. We find that ammonia ice, and to a lesser degree oxygen ice, are stable at higher temperatures than extrapolations in previous literature have predicted. Our results show that these ices should be retained over longer periods of time than previous extrapolations would predict, and a greater amount of these solids is required to support observation in exospheres of airless bodies in the outer solar system.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the connection between a cluster's structural configuration and observable measures of its gas emission that can be obtained in X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) surveys. We present an analytic model for the intracluster gas density profile: parameterised by the dark matter halo's inner logarithmic density slope, $\alpha$, the concentration, $c$, the gas profile's inner logarithmic density slope, $\varepsilon$, the dilution, $d$, and the gas fraction, $\eta$, normalised to cosmological content. We predict four probes of the gas emission: the emission-weighted, $T_\mathrm{X}$, and mean gas mass-weighted, $T_\mathrm{m_g}$, temperatures, and the spherically, $Y_\mathrm{sph}$, and cylindrically, $Y_\mathrm{cyl}$, integrated Compton parameters. Over a parameter space of clusters, we constrain the X-ray temperature scaling relations, $M_{200} - T_\mathrm{X}$ and $M_{500} - T_\mathrm{X}$, within $57.3\%$ and $41.6\%$, and $M_{200} - T_\mathrm{m_g}$ and $M_{500} - T_\mathrm{m_g}$, within $25.7\%$ and $7.0\%$, all respectively. When excising the cluster's core, the $M_{200} - T_\mathrm{X}$ and $M_{500} - T_\mathrm{X}$ relations are further constrained, to within $31.3\%$ and $17.1\%$, respectively. Similarly, we constrain the SZ scaling relations, $M_{200} - Y_\mathrm{sph}$ and $M_{500} - Y_\mathrm{sph}$, within $31.1\%$ and $17.7\%$, and $M_{200} - Y_\mathrm{cyl}$ and $M_{500} - Y_\mathrm{cyl}$, within $25.2\%$ and $22.0\%$, all respectively. The temperature observable $T_\mathrm{m_g}$ places the strongest constraint on the halo mass, whilst $T_\mathrm{X}$ is more sensitive to the parameter space. The SZ constraints are sensitive to the gas fraction, whilst insensitive to the form of the gas profile itself. In all cases, the halo mass is recovered with an uncertainty that suggests the cluster's structural profiles only contribute a minor uncertainty in its scaling relations.
#### Reconstruction of luminosity function from flux-limited samples

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of the progenitors of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and of their environment are encoded in their luminosity function and cosmic formation rate. They are usually recovered from a flux-limited sample based on Lynden-Bell's $c^{-}$ method. However, this method is based on the assumption that the luminosity is independent of the redshift. Observationally, if correlated, people use nonparametric $\tau$ statistical method to remove this correlation through the transformation, $L^{\prime}=L/g(z)$, where $z$ is the burst redshift, and $g(z)=(1+z)^{k}$ parameterizes the underlying luminosity evolution. However, the application of this method to different observations could result in very different luminosity functions. By the means of Monte Carlo simulation, in this paper, we demonstrate that the origin of an observed correlation, measured by the $\tau$ statistical method, is a complex combination of multiple factors when the underlying data are correlated. Thus, in this case, it is difficult to unbiasedly reconstruct the underlying population distribution from a truncated sample, unless the detailed information of the intrinsic correlation is accurately known in advance. In addition, we argue that an intrinsic correlation between luminosity function and formation rate is unlikely eliminated by a misconfigured transformation, and the $g(z)$, derived from a truncated sample with the $\tau$ statistical method, does not necessarily represent its underlying luminosity evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Transition disks, with inner regions depleted in dust and gas, could represent later stages of protoplanetary disk evolution when newly-formed planets are emerging. The PDS 70 system has attracted particular interest because of the presence of two giant planets at tens of au orbits within the inner disk cavity, at least one of which is itself accreting. However, the region around PDS 70 most relevant to understanding the planet populations revealed by exoplanet surveys of middle-aged stars is the inner disk, which is the dominant source of the system's excess infrared emission but only marginally resolved by ALMA. Here we present and analyze time-series optical and infrared photometry and spectroscopy that reveal the inner disk to be dynamic on timescales of days to years, with occultation of sub-micron dust dimming the star at optical wavelengths and 3-5 $\mu$m emission varying due to changes in disk structure. Remarkably, the infrared emission from the innermost region (nearly) disappears for ~1 year. We model the spectral energy distribution of the system and its time variation with a flattened warm (T <~ 600K) disk and a hotter (1200K) dust that could represent an inner rim or wall. The high dust-to-gas ratio of the inner disk relative to material accreting from the outer disk, means that the former could be a chimera consisting of depleted disk gas that is subsequently enriched with dust and volatiles produced by collisions and evaporation of planetesimals in the inner zone.
#### The first measurements of carbon isotopic ratios in post-RGB stars: SZ  Mon and DF Cyg. E-iSpec: A spectral analysis tool to derive elemental  abundances and isotopic ratios for evolved stars

 - **Abstract**
 Dusty post-red giant branch (post-RGB) stars are low- and intermediate-mass stars where the RGB evolution was prematurely terminated by a poorly understood binary interaction. These binary stars are considered to be low-luminosity analogues of post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) binary stars. In this study, we investigated the chemical composition of two dusty post-RGB binary stars, SZ Mon and DF Cyg, using multi-wavelength spectroscopic data from HERMES/Mercator (optical) and the APOGEE survey (near-infrared). Owing to challenges posed by existing spectral analysis tools for the study of evolved stars with complex atmospheres, we developed E-iSpec: a dedicated spectral analysis tool for evolved stars, to consistently determine atmospheric parameters, elemental abundances, and carbon isotopic ratios. Our abundance analysis revealed that observed depletion patterns and estimated depletion efficiencies resemble those found in post-AGB binary stars. However, the onset of chemical depletion in post-RGB targets occurs at higher condensation temperatures ($T_{\rm turn-off, post-RGB}\approx1400$ K), than in most post-AGB stars ($T_{\rm turn-off, post-AGB}\approx1100$ K). Additionally, our study resulted in the first estimates of carbon isotopic ratios for post-RGB stars ($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C$_{\rm SZ Mon}=8\pm4$, $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C$_{\rm DF Cyg}=12\pm3$). We found that the observationally derived CNO abundances and the carbon isotopic ratios of our post-RGB binary targets are in good agreement with theoretical predictions from the ATON single star evolutionary models involving first dredge-up and moderately-deep extra mixing. This agreement emphasises that in post-RGB binary targets, the observed CNO abundances reflect the chemical composition expected from single star nucleosynthesis (i.e., convective and non-convective mixing processes) occurring during the RGB phase before it is terminated.
#### Measurements of All-Particle Energy Spectrum and Mean Logarithmic Mass  of Cosmic Rays from 0.3 to 30 PeV with LHAASO-KM2A

 - **Abstract**
 We present the measurements of all-particle energy spectrum and mean logarithmic mass of cosmic rays in the energy range of 0.3-30 PeV using data collected from LHAASO-KM2A between September 2021 and December 2022, which is based on a nearly composition-independent energy reconstruction method, achieving unprecedented accuracy. Our analysis reveals the position of the knee at $3.67 \pm 0.05 \pm 0.15$ PeV. Below the knee, the spectral index is found to be -$2.7413 \pm 0.0004 \pm 0.0050$, while above the knee, it is -$3.128 \pm 0.005 \pm 0.027$, with the sharpness of the transition measured with a statistical error of 2%. The mean logarithmic mass of cosmic rays is almost heavier than helium in the whole measured energy range. It decreases from 1.7 at 0.3 PeV to 1.3 at 3 PeV, representing a 24% decline following a power law with an index of -$0.1200 \pm 0.0003 \pm 0.0341$. This is equivalent to an increase in abundance of light components. Above the knee, the mean logarithmic mass exhibits a power law trend towards heavier components, which is reversal to the behavior observed in the all-particle energy spectrum. Additionally, the knee position and the change in power-law index are approximately the same. These findings suggest that the knee observed in the all-particle spectrum corresponds to the knee of the light component, rather than the medium-heavy components.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution astronomical spectroscopy carried out with a photonic Fourier transform spectrograph (FTS) requires long asymmetrical optical delay lines that can be dynamically tuned. For example, to achieve a spectral resolution of R = 30,000, a delay line as long as 1.5 cm would be required. Such delays are inherently prone to phase errors caused by temperature fluctuations. This is due to the relatively large thermo-optic coefficient and long lengths of the waveguides, in this case composed of SiN, resulting in thermally dependent changes to the optical path length. To minimize phase error to the order of 0.05 radians, thermal stability of the order of 0.05{\deg} C is necessary. A thermal control system capable of stability such as this would require a fast thermal response and minimal overshoot/undershoot. With a PID temperature control loop driven by a Peltier cooler and thermistor, we minimized interference fringe phase error to +/- 0.025 radians and achieved temperature stability on the order of 0.05{\deg} C. We present a practical system for precision temperature control of a foundry-fabricated and packaged FTS device on a SiN platform with delay lines ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 cm in length using inexpensive off-the-shelf components, including design details, control loop optimization, and considerations for thermal control of integrated photonics.

 - **Abstract**
 We use a special gluon distribution in the nucleon, which was predicted by a QCD evolution equation to consistently explain several intriguing phenomena associated with gamma-ray bursts. They are the GeV-TeV spectra of GRB 221009A, the remarkably symmetrical explosion cloud in kilonova AT2017gfo, and the absence of a very high-energy gamma-ray signature in GRB 170817A. We find that these occurrences can be attributed to the gluon condensation within nucleons, i.e., a significant number of soft gluons within nucleons are condensed at a critical momentum, resulting in the emergence of a steep and high peak in the gluon distributions. Through this profound connection between microscopic and macroscopic phenomena, we have not only expanded the applications of the hadronic scenario in cosmic gamma-ray emissions but also presented new evidence for the existence of gluon condensation.

 - **Abstract**
 Many dozens of protoplanetary discs show signatures of sculpting by planets. To help find these protoplanets by direct imaging, we compute their broadband spectral energy distributions, which overlap with the JWST (James Webb Space Telescope) and ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) passbands. We consider circumplanetary spherical envelopes, and combinations of circumplanetary discs and envelopes, heated by protoplanet accretion and external irradiation. Searches with JWST's NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) and the blue portion of MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) are most promising since $\sim$300--1000 K protoplanets outshine their $\sim$20--50 K circumstellar environs at wavelengths of $\sim$2--20 $\mu$m. Detection is easier if circumplanetary dust settles into discs (more likely for more massive planets) or is less abundant per unit mass gas (because of grain growth or filtration). At wavelengths longer than 20 $\mu$m, circumplanetary material is difficult to see against the circumstellar disc's surface layers that directly absorb starlight and reprocess it to the far-infrared. Such contaminating circumstellar emission can be serious even within the evacuated gaps observed by ALMA. Only in strongly depleted regions, like the cavity of the transitional disc PDS 70 where two protoplanets have been confirmed, may long-wavelength windows open for protoplanet study. We compile a list of candidate protoplanets and identify those with potentially the highest accretion luminosities, all peaking in the near-infrared.

 - **Abstract**
 Intervening metal absorbers in quasar spectra at $z > 6$ can be used as probes to study the chemical enrichment of the Universe during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). This work presents the comoving line densities ($dn/dX$) of low ionisation absorbers, namely, Mg II (2796\r{A}), C II (1334\r{A}) and O I (1302\r{A}) across $2 <z < 6$ using the E-XQR-30 metal absorber catalog prepared from 42 XSHOOTER quasar spectra at $5.8 < z < 6.6$. Here, we analyse 280 Mg II ($1.9 < z < 6.4$), 22 C II ($5.2 < z < 6.4$) and 10 O I ($5.3 < z < 6.4$) intervening absorbers, thereby building up on previous studies with improved sensitivity of 50% completeness at an equivalent width of $W > 0.03$\r{A}. For the first time, we present the comoving line densities of 131 weak ($W < 0.3$\r{A}) intervening Mg II absorbers at $1.9 < z < 6.4$ which exhibit constant evolution with redshift similar to medium ($0.3 < W < 1.0$\r{A}) absorbers. However, the cosmic mass density of Mg II - dominated by strong Mg II systems - traces the evolution of global star formation history from redshift 1.9 to 5.5. E-XQR-30 also increases the absorption path length by a factor of 50% for C II and O I whose line densities show a rising trend towards $z > 5$, in agreement with previous works. In the context of a decline in metal enrichment of the Universe at $z > 5$, the overall evolution in the incidence rates of absorption systems can be explained by a weak - possibly soft fluctuating - UV background. Our results, thereby, provide evidence for a late reionization continuing to occur in metal-enriched and therefore, biased regions in the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Abell 3667 is a near-by (z=0.056) merging cluster with the most prominent cold front and a pair of two bright radio relics. Assuming a face-to-face merger scenario, the origin of the cold front is often considered to be a remnant core of the cluster stripped of its surrounding ICM. Sarazin et al. (2016) proposed an offset merger scenario in which the sub-cluster cores rotate after the first core-crossing. To distinguish between these scenarios, we revisited the ICM distribution and measured the line-of-sight bulk ICM velocity using a calibration technique proposed by Sanders et al. (2020). In the unsharp masked image, we identified several ICM features, some of which we detected for the first time. There is an enhancement of the X-ray surface brightness extending from the 1st BCG to the cold front, which is named the "BCG-E tail". The notable feature is the "RG1 vortex", which is a clockwise vortex-like enhancement with a radius of about 250 kpc connecting the 1st BCG to the radio galaxy (RG1). It is particularly enhanced near the north of the 1st BCG, which is named the "BCG-N tail". The thermodynamic map shows that the ICM in the RG1 vortex has a relatively high abundance of 0.5-0.6 solar compared to the surrounding regions. The ICM of the BCG-E tail also has high abundance, and low pseudo-entropy, and can be interpreted as the remnant of the ICM of the cluster core. Including its arc-like shape, the RG1 vortex supports the idea that the ICM around the cluster center is rotating, which is natural in an offset merger scenario. The results of the line-of-sight bulk ICM velocity measurement show that the ICM around the BCG-N tail is redshifted with a velocity difference of 940$\pm$440 km s$^{-1}$ compared to the optical redshift of the 1st BCG. Other symptoms of diversity in the line-of-sight velocity of the ICM were also obtained and discussed in the context of the offset merger.

 - **Abstract**
 The use of artificial Laser Guide Stars (LGS) is planned for the new generation of giant segmented mirror telescopes, to extend the sky coverage of their adaptive optics systems. The LGS, being a 3D object at a finite distance will have a large elongation that will affect its use with the Shack-Hartmann (SH) wavefront sensor. In this paper, we compute the expected performance for a Pyramid WaveFront Sensor (PWFS) using a LGS for a 40 m telescope affected by photon noise, and also extend the analysis to a flat 2D object as reference. We developed a new way to discretize the LGS, and a new, faster method of propagating the light for any Fourier Filtering wavefront sensors (FFWFS) when using extended objects. We present the use of a sensitivity model to predict the performance of a closed-loop adaptive optic system. We optimized a point source calibrated interaction matrix to accommodate the signal of an extended object, by means of computing optical gains using a convolutional model. We found that the sensitivity drop, given the size of the extended laser source, is large enough to make the system operate in a low-performance regime given the expected return flux of the LGS. The width of the laser beam, rather than the thickness of the sodium layer was identified as the limiting factor. Even an ideal, flat LGS will have a drop in performance due to the flux of the LGS, and small variations in the return flux will result in large variations in performance. We conclude that knife-edge-like wavefront sensors, such as the PWFS, are not recommended for their use with LGS for a 40 m telescope, as they will operate in a low-performance regime, given the size of the extended object.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, there has been a gradual increase in the performance of Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) cameras. These cameras have gained popularity as a viable alternative to charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras in a wide range of applications. One particular application is the CMOS camera installed in small space telescopes. However, the limited power and spatial resources available on satellites present challenges in maintaining ideal observation conditions, including temperature and radiation environment. Consequently, images captured by CMOS cameras are susceptible to issues such as dark current noise and defective pixels. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven framework for mitigating dark current noise and bad pixels for CMOS cameras. Our approach involves two key steps: pixel clustering and function fitting. During pixel clustering step, we identify and group pixels exhibiting similar dark current noise properties. Subsequently, in the function fitting step, we formulate functions that capture the relationship between dark current and temperature, as dictated by the Arrhenius law. Our framework leverages ground-based test data to establish distinct temperature-dark current relations for pixels within different clusters. The cluster results could then be utilized to estimate the dark current noise level and detect bad pixels from real observational data. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we have conducted tests using real observation data obtained from the Yangwang-1 satellite, equipped with a near-ultraviolet telescope and an optical telescope. The results show a considerable improvement in the detection efficiency of space-based telescopes.
#### Peak energy--Isotropic Luminosity Correlation and Jet Opening Angle  Evolution in Swift-BAT Short GRBs with Soft Tail Emission

 - **Abstract**
 Some short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) exhibit a short duration and spectral hard emission (referred to as a "hard spike") followed by a slightly longer soft emission (known as a "soft tail"). We identified nine SGRBs with known redshift in the \textit{Swift}/BAT gamma-ray burst catalog by specifically searching for the soft tail. We found that spectra of these SGRBs can be described as a cutoff power-law model for both hard spike and soft tail, and both show time variation keeping the $E_{\rm peak}$--$L_{\rm iso}$ correlation. This suggests that the emission mechanism of both phenomena is identical. Furthermore, we found a trend of luminosity evolution as a function of redshift. This phenomenon suggests that these bursts originate from sources that have intrinsically bright and/or energy density concentrated within a narrower jet at higher redshift. We demonstrate that the average jet opening angle, derived from the jet break, can be explained by considering a model based on a strongly redshift-dependent jet opening angle.

 - **Abstract**
 We developed an FPGA-based high-speed readout system for a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor to observe soft X-ray transients in future satellite missions, such as HiZ-GUNDAM. Our previous research revealed that the CMOS image sensor has low-energy X-ray detection capability (0.4-4 keV) and strong radiation tolerance, which satisfies the requirements of the HiZ-GUNDAM mission. However, CMOS sensors typically have small pixel sizes (e.g., $\sim$10 ${\rm \mu m}$), resulting in large volumes of image data. GSENSE400BSI has 2048$\times$2048 pixels, producing 6 Mbyte per frame. These large volumes of observed raw image data cannot be stored in a satellite bus system with a limited storage size. Therefore, only X-ray photon events must be extracted from the raw image data. Furthermore, the readout time of CMOS image sensors is approximately ten times faster than that of typical X-ray CCDs, requiring faster event extraction on a timescale of $\sim$0.1 s. To address these issues, we have developed an FPGA-based image signal processing system capable of high-speed X-ray event extraction onboard without storing raw image data. The developed compact system enabled mounting on a CubeSat mission, facilitating early in-orbit operation demonstration. Here, we present the design and results of the performance evaluation tests of the proposed FPGA-based readout system. Utilizing X-ray irradiation experiments, the results of the X-ray event extraction with the onboard and offline processing methods were consistent, validating the functionality of the proposed system.
#### The role of heating on the formation and the dynamics of YSO jets : I. A  parametric study

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical arguments as well as observations of young stellar objects (YSO) support the presence of a diversified circumstellar environment. A stellar jet is thought to account for most of the stellar spin down and disk wind outflow for the observed high mass loss rate, thus playing a major role in the launching of powerful jets. RY Tau, for instance, is an extensively studied intermediate mass pre-main sequence star. Observational data reveal a small scale jet called microjet. Nevertheless, it is not clear how the microjet shapes the jet observed at a large scale. The goal is to investigate the spatial stability and structure of the central jet at a large scale by mixing the stellar and disk components. We mix two existing analytical self-similar models for the disk and the stellar winds to build the initial set-ups. Instead of using a polytropic equation of state, we map from the analytical solutions, the heating and cooling sources. The heating exchange rate is controlled by two parameters, its spatial extent and its intensity. The central jet and the surrounding disk are strongly affected by these two parameters. We separate the results in three categories, which show different emissivity, temperature, and velocity maps. We reached this categorization by looking at the opening angle of the stellar solution. For cylindrically, well collimated jets, we have opening angles as low as 10 degrees between 8 and 10 au, and for the wider jets, we can reach 30 degrees with a morphology closer to radial solar winds. Our parametric study shows that the less heated the outflow is, the more collimated it appears. We also show that recollimation shocks appear consistently with UV observations in terms of temperature but not density.

 - **Abstract**
 The problems of heating and acceleration of solar wind particles are of significant and enduring interest in astrophysics. The interactions between waves and particles are crucial in determining the distributions of proton and alpha particles, resulting in non-Maxwellian characteristics including temperature anisotropies and particle beams. These processes can be better understood as long as the beam can be separated from the core for the two major components of the solar wind. We utilized an alternative numerical approach that leverages the clustering technique employed in Machine Learning to differentiate the primary populations within the velocity distribution, rather than employing the conventional biMaxwellian fitting method. Separation of the core and beam revealed new features for protons and alphas. We estimated that the total temperature of the two beams was slightly higher than that of their respective cores, and the temperature anisotropy for the cores and beams was larger than 1. We concluded that the temperature ratio between alphas and protons largely over 4 is due to the presence of a massive alpha beam, which is approximately 50% of the alpha core. We provided evidence that the alpha core and beam populations are sensitive to Alfv\'enic fluctuations and the surfing effect found in the literature can be recovered only when considering the core and beam as a single population. Several similarities between proton and alpha beams would suggest a common and local generation mechanism not shared with the alpha core, which may not have necessarily been accelerated and heated locally.
