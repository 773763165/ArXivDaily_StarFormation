#### Tilted Dark Halos are Common, Long-Lived, and can Warp Galactic Disks

 - **Abstract**
 The outer disk of the Milky Way Galaxy is warped and flared. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these phenomena, but none have quantitatively reproduced both features. Recent work has demonstrated that the Galactic stellar halo is tilted with respect to the disk plane, suggesting that at least some component of the dark matter halo may also be tilted. Here we show that a dark halo tilted in the same direction as the stellar halo can induce a warp and flare in the Galactic disk at the same amplitude and orientation as the data. In our model the warp is visible in both the gas and stars of all ages, which is consistent with the breadth of observational tracers of the warp. These results, in combination with data in the stellar halo, provide compelling evidence that our Galaxy is embedded in a tilted dark matter halo. This misalignment of the dark halo and the disk holds clue to the formation history of the Galaxy, and represents the next step in the dynamical modeling of the Galactic potential.

 - **Abstract**
 Standard rulers such as the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale serve as workhorses for precision tests of cosmology, enabling distance measurements that probe the geometry and expansion history of our Universe. Aside from BAO measurements from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), most standard ruler techniques operate at relatively low redshifts and depend on biased tracers of the matter density field. In a companion paper, we explored the scientific reach of nulling estimators, where CMB lensing convergence maps are cross-correlated with linear combinations of similar maps from line intensity mapping (LIM) to precisely null out the low-redshift contributions to CMB lensing. We showed that nulling estimators can be used to constrain the high redshift matter power spectrum and showed that this spectrum exhibits discernible BAO features. Here we propose using these features as a standard ruler at high redshifts that does not rely on biased tracers. Forecasting such a measurement at $z \sim 5$, we find that next-generation instruments will be able to constrain the BAO scale to percent-level precision at $7.2 \%$, while our futuristic observing scenario can constrain the BAO scale to $4\%$ precision. This constitutes a fundamentally new kind of BAO measurement during early epochs in our cosmic history.
#### On the relative importance of shocks and self-gravity in modifying tidal  disruption event debris streams

 - **Abstract**
 In a tidal disruption event (TDE), a star is destroyed by the gravitational field of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) to produce a stream of debris, some of which accretes onto the SMBH and creates a luminous flare. The distribution of mass along the stream has a direct impact on the accretion rate, and thus modeling the time-dependent evolution of this distribution provides insight into the relevant physical processes that drive the observable properties of TDEs. Analytic models that only account for the ballistic evolution of the debris do not capture salient and time-dependent features of the mass distribution, suggesting that fluid dynamical effects significantly modify the debris dynamics. Previous investigations have claimed that shocks are primarily responsible for these modifications, but here we show -- with high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations -- that self-gravity is the dominant physical mechanism responsible for the anomalous (i.e., not predicted by ballistic models) debris stream features and its time dependence. These high-resolution simulations also show that there is a specific length scale on which self-gravity modifies the debris mass distribution, and as such there is enhanced power in specific Fourier modes. Our results have implications for the stability of the debris stream under the influence of self-gravity, particularly at late times and the corresponding observational signatures of TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamic atmosphere imposes challenges to ground-based cosmic microwave background observation, especially for measurements on large angular scales. The hydrometeors in the atmosphere, mostly in the form of clouds, scatter the ambient thermal radiation and are known to be the main linearly polarized source in the atmosphere. This scattering-induced polarization is significantly enhanced for ice clouds due to the alignment of ice crystals under gravity, which are also the most common clouds seen at the millimeter-astronomy sites at high altitudes. This work presents a multifrequency study of cloud polarization observed by the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) experiment on Cerro Toco in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile, from 2016 to 2022, at the frequency bands centered around 40, 90, 150, and 220 GHz. Using a machine-learning-assisted cloud classifier, we made connections between the transient polarized emission found in all four frequencies with the clouds imaged by monitoring cameras at the observing site. The polarization angles of the cloud events are found to be mostly $90^\circ$ from the local meridian, which is consistent with the presence of horizontally aligned ice crystals. The 90 and 150 GHz polarization data are consistent with a power law with a spectral index of $3.90\pm0.06$, while an excess/deficit of polarization amplitude is found at 40/220 GHz compared with a Rayleigh scattering spectrum. These results are consistent with Rayleigh-scattering-dominated cloud polarization, with possible effects from supercooled water absorption and/or Mie scattering from a population of large cloud particles that contribute to the 220 GHz polarization.
#### Statistical analysis of long GRBs' prompt emission and X-ray flares:  multivariate clustering and correlations

 - **Abstract**
 The extensive observations done by the X-ray telescope onboard Neil Gehrels Swift observatory has revealed the presence of late time flares concurrent with the decaying afterglow emission. However, the origin of these flares are elusive. In this work, we made use of the large database of Swift observations (2005 - 2020) of long GRBs to conduct a systematic statistical study between the prompt gamma ray emission and X-ray flares by characterising their temporal and spectral properties in terms of duration, quiescent period, peak flux, fluence, minimum variability timescale and spectral power-law index. The multi-dimensional database of parameters, thereby, generated was investigated by the principal component analysis which revealed there is no evident correlation between the different parameters of the prompt emission and X-ray flares. Furthermore, the correlation studies reveal that while there is a trend of positive correlation between the minimum variability timescale of flare and its duration, and a strong negative correlation with its peak flux, there are no such correlations observed in the prompt emission. Similarly, we find a positive correlation between the quiescent period and flare duration, and a negative correlation with the flare peak flux, while no such correlations are observed for the prompt emission of GRBs. Finally, among the X-ray flares, we find two dominant classes whose variations are driven by the minimum variability timescale, peak flux and fluences of the flares. A catalog of these different parameters characterising the prompt and flare emissions is presented.
#### The peculiar new state of the blazar PKS 1510-089

 - **Abstract**
 Contemporaneous multiwavelength observations with H.E.S.S., SALT, Fermi-LAT, Swift, and ATOM show that the blazar PKS 1510-089 suffered a significant decrease in its optical flux, degree of optical polarization and high-energy gamma-ray (E > 100 MeV) flux since July 2021. Meanwhile, the X-ray and very-high-energy gamma-ray (E > 100 GeV) fluxes remained steady throughout 2021 and 2022. The degree of optical polarization decreased to about zero in 2022, indicating an unpolarized dominating accretion disk component in the optical-UV domain that is completely diluting the polarized electron synchrotron component. In this proceeding we will discuss, via theoretical SED modeling, possible reasons for this dramatic change in the appearance of this blazar.
#### Generation of photoionized plasmas in the laboratory of relevance to  accretion-powered x-ray sources using keV line radiation

 - **Abstract**
 We describe laboratory experiments to generate x-ray photoionized plasmas of relevance to accretion-powered x-ray sources such as neutron star binaries and quasars, with significant improvements over previous work. We refer to a key quantity, the photoionization parameter, defined as xi = 4{\pi}F/n_e where F is the x-ray flux and n_e the electron density. This is usually meaningful in a steady state context, but is commonly used, in the literature, as a figure of merit for laboratory experiments that are, of necessity, time dependent. We demonstrate that we can achieve values of xi >100 erg-cm s-1 using laser-plasma x-ray sources, in the regime of interest for several astrophysical scenarios. In particular, we show that our use of a keV line source, rather than the quasi-blackbody radiation fields normally employed in such experiments, has allowed generation of a ratio of inner-shell to outer-shell photoionization expected from a blackbody source with ~keV spectral temperature. This is a key factor in allowing experiments to be compared to the predictions of codes employed to model astrophysical sources. We compare calculations from our in-house plasma modelling code with those from Cloudy and find moderately good agreement for the time evolution of both electron temperature and average ionisation. However, a comparison of code predictions of a K-beta argon X-ray spectrum with experimental data reveals that our Cloudy simulation overestimates the intensities of more highly ionised argon species. This is not totally surprising as the Cloudy model was generated for a single set of plasma conditions, while the experimental data are spatially integrated.

 - **Abstract**
 The dimmest and most numerous outlier of the Type Ia supernova population, Type Iax events, is increasingly being found in the results of observational campaigns. There is currently no single accepted model to describe these events. This 2D study explores the viability of modeling Type Iax events as a hybrid C/O/Ne white dwarf progenitor undergoing a deflagration using the multi-physics software FLASH. This hybrid was created using the stellar evolution code MESA, and its C-depleted core and mixed structure have demonstrated lower yields than traditional C/O progenitors in previous deflagration-to-detonation studies. To generate a sample, 30 "realizations" of this simulation were performed, the only difference being the shape of the initial matchhead used to start the deflagration. As consistent with earlier work, these realizations produce the familiar hot dense bound remnant surrounded by sparse ejecta. Our results indicate the majority of the star remains unburned (~70%) and bound (>90%). Our realizations produce total ejecta yields on the order of 10$^{-2}$ - 10$^{-1}$ solar masses, ejected $^{56}$Ni yields on the order of 10$^{-4}$ - 10$^{-2}$ solar masses, and ejecta kinetic energies on the order of 10$^{48}$ - 10$^{49}$ ergs. Compared to yields inferred from recent observations of the dimmest Type Iax events - SN 2007qd, SN 2008ha, SN 2010ae, SN 2019gsc, SN 2019muj, SN 2020kyg, and SN 2021fcg - our simulation produces comparable $^{56}$Ni yields, but too-small total yields and kinetic energies. Reignition of the remnant is also seen in some realizations.

 - **Abstract**
 The Tenerife Microwave Spectrometer (TMS) is a ground-based radio-spectrometer that will take absolute measurements of the sky between 10-20 GHz. To ensure the sensitivity and immunity to systematic errors of these measurements, TMS includes an internal calibration system optimised for the TMS band, and cooled down to 4 K. It consists of an Aluminium core, composed of a baseplate and a bed of pyramidal elements coated with an absorber material and a metallic shield. The absorber coating is made of a commercial resin ECCOSORB CR/MF 117. To achieve the high stability (+/- 1 mK/h), temperature homogeneity (thermal gradients {AT <= 25 mK), and emissivity (e>= 0.999) requirements of the reference unit, careful consideration has been given to the RF and thermal properties of the materials, as well as their geometry. In summary, this paper presents a comprehensive account of the design, characterisation, and test results of the TMS reference system.
#### Predicting reliable H$_2$ column density maps from molecular line data  using machine learning

 - **Abstract**
 The total mass estimate of molecular clouds suffers from the uncertainty in the H$_2$-CO conversion factor, the so-called $X_{\rm CO}$ factor, which is used to convert the $^{12}$CO (1--0) integrated intensity to the H$_2$ column density. We demonstrate the machine learning's ability to predict the H$_2$ column density from the $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O (1--0) data set of four star-forming molecular clouds; Orion A, Orion B, Aquila, and M17. When the training is performed on a subset of each cloud, the overall distribution of the predicted column density is consistent with that of the Herschel column density. The total column density predicted and observed is consistent within 10\%, suggesting that the machine learning prediction provides a reasonable total mass estimate of each cloud. However, the distribution of the column density for values $> \sim 2 \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, which corresponds to the dense gas, could not be predicted well. This indicates that molecular line observations tracing the dense gas are required for the training. We also found a significant difference between the predicted and observed column density when we created the model after training the data on different clouds. This highlights the presence of different $X_{\rm CO}$ factors between the clouds, and further training in various clouds is required to correct for these variations. We also demonstrated that this method could predict the column density toward the area not observed by Herschel if the molecular line and column density maps are available for the small portion, and the molecular line data are available for the larger areas.
#### The Mars Science Laboratory record of optical depth measurements via  solar imaging

 - **Abstract**
 The Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover has monitored the Martian environment in Gale crater since landing in 2012. This study reports the record of optical depth derived from visible and near-infrared images of the Sun. Aerosol optical depth, which is mostly due to dust but also includes ice, dominates the record, with gas optical depth too small to measure. The optical depth record includes the effects of regional dust storms and one planet-encircling dust event, showing the expected peaks during southern spring and summer and relatively lower and more stable optical depth in fall and winter. The measurements show that there is a seasonally varying diurnal change in dust load, with the optical depth peaking in the morning during southern spring and summer, correlated with thermotidal pressure changes. However, there was no systematic diurnal change during autumn and winter, except after one regional storm. There were indications that the dust was relatively enhanced at high altitudes during high-optical-depth periods and that high-altitude ice was significant during winter. The observations did not provide much information about particle size or composition, but they were consistent with a smaller particle size after aphelion (in southern winter). No scattering halos were seen in associated sky images, even when there was visual evidence of ice hazes or clouds, which suggests small or amorphous ice particles. Unexpectedly, the measurement campaign revealed that the cameras collected saltating sand in their sunshades 1.97 m above the surface. As a result, the measurement strategy had to be adjusted to avoid high-elevation imaging to avoid sand covering the optics.
#### A new break near 10 TeV in the energy spectrum of protons according to  data from space-based instruments: astrophysical interpretation
 - **Authors:** A.A. Lagutin, N.V. Volkov

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07420
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07420
 - **Abstract**
 Recent experimental data from space-based instruments of the DAMPE and CALET collaborations have shown that the energy spectrum of protons has a new feature, a break in the $\sim 10$ TeV region. In this energy range, the spectrum index of the observed particles varies from $-2.6$ to $-2.9$. The purpose of this work is to establish the local sources's position and age that determine this break, the index of the proton generation spectrum in them, as well as the astrophysical interpretation of the results obtained in the DAMPE and CALET experiments. Within the framework of the model of nonclassical diffusion of cosmic rays developed by the authors, which has break due to the propagation of particles in a sharply inhomogeneous (fractal type) galactic medium, it is shown that break in this energy range is formed by tevatron located at a distance of $\sim 120$ pc from the Earth. These source, whose age is $\sim 5 \cdot 10^5$ years, generate particles with a spectrum index $\sim 2.7$. The power-law behavior of the proton spectrum before and after the break, soft spectrum of particles generation in the source, first obtained in the DAMPE and CALET experiments, should be considered as an indication of the need to revise the standard paradigm accepted today about the sources of cosmic rays, mechanisms of particle acceleration in them and particles propagation in the Galaxy.
#### Where are the Pevatrons that Form the Knee in the Spectrum of the Cosmic  Ray Nucleon Component around 4 PeV?

 - **Abstract**
 The paper discusses an approach that made it possible to estimate the distance to the nearest pevatrons, which form a knee in the spectrum of the cosmic ray nucleon component of about $4$ PeV. It is based on the spectra of nucleons and electrons obtained by the authors in the framework of the superdiffusion model of nonclassical cosmic rays diffusion, which have a knee, on the assumption that nucleons and electrons are accelerated by the same type sources and their propagation in an inhomogeneous turbulent galactic medium is characterized by the same diffusion coefficient, and also on the knee in the spectrum of the electronic component in the region of $0.9$ TeV, established in the DAMPE experiment. It is shown that pevatrons, which form a knee in the spectrum of the cosmic ray nucleon component of about $4$ PeV, are located at distances of the order of $0.75$ kpc from the Earth.
#### Bridging between type IIb and Ib supernovae: SN IIb 2022crv with a very  thin Hydrogen envelope

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical, near-infrared, and radio observations of supernova (SN) SN~IIb 2022crv. We show that it retained a very thin H envelope and transitioned from a SN~IIb to a SN~Ib; prominent H$\alpha$ seen in the pre-maximum phase diminishes toward the post-maximum phase, while He {\sc i} lines show increasing strength. \texttt{SYNAPPS} modeling of the early spectra of SN~2022crv suggests that the absorption feature at 6200\,\AA\ is explained by a substantial contribution of H$\alpha$ together with Si {\sc ii}, as is also supported by the velocity evolution of H$\alpha$. The light-curve evolution is consistent with the canonical stripped-envelope supernova subclass but among the slowest. The light curve lacks the initial cooling phase and shows a bright main peak (peak M$_{V}$=$-$17.82$\pm$0.17 mag), mostly driven by radioactive decay of $\rm^{56}$Ni. The light-curve analysis suggests a thin outer H envelope ($M_{\rm env} \sim$0.05 M$_{\odot}$) and a compact progenitor (R$_{\rm env}$ $\sim$3 R$_{\odot}$). An interaction-powered synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) model can reproduce the radio light curves with a mean shock velocity of 0.1c. The mass-loss rate is estimated to be in the range of (1.9$-$2.8) $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for an assumed wind velocity of 1000 km s$^{-1}$, which is on the high end in comparison with other compact SNe~IIb/Ib. SN~2022crv fills a previously unoccupied parameter space of a very compact progenitor, representing a beautiful continuity between the compact and extended progenitor scenario of SNe~IIb/Ib.

 - **Abstract**
 Direct detection of exoplanets around nearby stars requires advanced Adaptive Optics (AO) systems. High order systems are needed to reach high Strehl Ratio (SR) in near infrared and optical wavelengths on future Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes (GSMTs). Direct detection of faint exoplanets with the ESO ELT will require some tens of thousand of correction modes. Resolution and sensitivity of the wavefront sensor (WFS) are key requirements for this science case. We present a new class of WFSs, the Bi-Orthogonal Foucault-knife-edge Sensors (or Bi-O-edge), that is directly inspired by the Foucault knife edge test (Foucault 1859). The idea consists of using a beam-splitter producing two foci, each of which is sensed by an edge with orthogonal direction to the other. We describe two implementation concepts: The Bi-O-edge sensor can be realised with a sharp edge and a tip-tilt modulation device (sharp Bi-O-edge) or with a smooth gradual transmission over a grey edge (grey Bi-O-edge). A comparison between the Bi-O-edge concepts and the 4-sided classical Pyramid Wavefront Sensor (PWS) gives some important insights into the nature of the measurements.Our analysis shows that the sensitivity gain of the Bi-O edge with respect to the PWS depends on the system configuration. The gain is a function of the number of control modes and the modulation angle. We found that for the sharp Bi-O-edge, the gain in reduction of propagated photon noise variance approaches a theoretical factor of 2 for a large number of control modes and small modulation angle, meaning that the sharp Bi-O-edge only needs half of the photons of the PWS to reach similar measurement accuracy.
#### Search for the Prompt Atmospheric Neutrino Flux in IceCube

 - **Abstract**
 For about a decade the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has been observing a high-energy diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux. At these energies, an important source of background are the prompt atmospheric neutrinos produced in decays of charmed mesons that are part of cosmic-ray-induced air showers. The production yield of charmed mesons in the very forward phase space of hadronic interactions, and thus the flux of prompt neutrinos, is not well known and has not yet been observed by IceCube. A measurement of the flux of prompt neutrinos will improve the modeling of hadronic interactions in cosmic-ray induced air showers at high energies. Additionally, in the context of astrophysical neutrino measurements, understanding this background flux will improve the measurement precision of the spectral shape in the future. In particular, the analysis of up-going muon neutrino-induced tracks in IceCube provides a large sample of atmospheric neutrinos which likely includes prompt neutrinos. However, the measurement of a subdominant prompt neutrino flux strongly depends on the hypothesis for the dominant astrophysical neutrino flux. This makes the estimation of upper limits on the prompt neutrino flux challenging. We discuss the extent of this model dependency on the astrophysical flux and propose a method to calculate robust upper limits. Furthermore, a possible dedicated search of the prompt neutrino flux using multiple IceCube detection channels is outlined.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a flux density study of 89 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) regularly monitored as part of the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array (MPTA) using the L-Band receiver with an approximately two week cadence between 2019-2022. For each pulsar, we have determined the mean flux densities at each epoch in eight $\sim$97 MHz sub-bands ranging from 944 to 1625 MHz. From these we have derived their modulation indices, their average and peak-to-median flux densities in each sub-band, as well as their mean spectral indices across the entire frequency range. We find that the vast majority of the MSPs have spectra that are well described by a simple power law, with a mean spectral index of -1.86(6). Using the temporal variation of the flux densities we measured the structure functions and determined the refractive scintillation timescale for seven. The structure functions provide strong evidence that the intrinsic radio luminosities of MSPs are stable. As a population, the average modulation index at 20 cm wavelengths peaks near unity at dispersion measures (DMs) of $\sim$20 pc cm$^{-3}$ and by a DM of 100 pc cm$^{-3}$ are closer to 0.2, due to refractive scintillation. We find that timing arrays can improve their observing efficiency by reacting to scintillation maxima, and that 20 cm FRB surveys should prioritise highly scintillating mid-latitude regions of the Galactic sky where they will find $\sim$30% more events and bursts at greater distances.

 X-ray spectroscopy is a powerful technique for the analysis of the energy distribution of X-rays from astrophysical sources. It allows for the study of the properties, composition, and physical processes taking place at the site of emission. X-ray spectral analysis methods are diverse, as they often need to be tailored to the specific type of instrument used to collect the data. In addition, these methods advance together with the improvement of the technology of the telescopes and detectors. Here, we present a compact overview of the common procedures currently employed in this field. We describe the fundamental data structure and the essential auxiliary information required for conducting spectral analysis and we explore some of the most relevant aspects related to statistical and computational challenges in X-ray spectroscopy. Furthermore, we outline some practical scenarios in the context of data reduction, modeling and fitting of spectra, and spectral simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we present the first-ever $L$- and $M$-band interferometric observations of Circinus, building upon a recent $N$-band analysis. We used these observations to reconstruct images and fit Gaussian models to the $L$ and $M$ bands. Our findings reveal a thin edge-on disk whose width is marginally resolved and is the spectral continuation of the disk imaged in the $N$ band to shorter wavelengths. Additionally, we find a point-like source in the $L$ and $M$ bands that, based on the $LMN$-band spectral energy distribution fit, corresponds to the $N$-band point source. We also demonstrate that there is no trace of direct sightlines to hot dust surfaces in the circumnuclear dust structure of Circinus. By assuming the dust is present, we find that obscuration of A$_{\rm V} \gtrsim 250$ mag is necessary to reproduce the measured fluxes. Hence, the imaged disk could play the role of the obscuring "torus" in the unified scheme of active galactic nuclei. Furthermore, we explored the parameter space of the disk + hyperbolic cone radiative transfer models and identify a simple modification at the base of the cone. Adding a cluster of clumps just above the disk and inside the base of the hyperbolic cone provides a much better match to the observed temperature distribution in the central aperture. This aligns well with the radiation-driven fountain models that have recently emerged. Only the unique combination of sensitivity and spatial resolution of the VLTI allows such models to be scrutinized and constrained in detail. We plan to test the applicability of this detailed dust structure to other MATISSE-observed active galactic nuclei in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to study the dust distribution in the central regions of the Keplerian disk of the Red Rectangle, the prototype of binary post-AGB stars with rotating circumbinary disks, and to compare it with the distribution of relevant molecular gas tracers We present new high-resolution (20 milliarcseconds, mas) ALMA observations of continuum and line emissions at 0.9 mm. The maps have been analyzed by means of a simple model of dust and free-free emissionn that is able to reproduce the continuum data. Resuts: i) We find that most of the dust emission in the Red Rectangle is concentrated in the inner disk regions, with a typical size of 250 AU in diameter and 50 AU in width. ii) The settlement of dust grains onto inner equatorial regions is remarkable when compared with the relatively widespread gas distribution. iii) This region is basically coincident with the warm PDR (photo-dominated region) where CI, CII, and certain molecules such as HCN are presumably formed, as well as probably PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, whose emission is very strong in this source). iv) We confirm the large size of the grains, with a typical radius ~ 150 mu The opacity of dust at 0.9 mm is deduced to be relatively large, ~0.5. v) We also confirm the existence of a very compact HII region in the center, for which we measure an extent of 10 - 15 mas (~ 10 AU) and a total flux of 7 - 8 mJy at 0.9 mm.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational microlensing is a powerful method for discovering Isolated Stellar-Mass Black Holes(ISMBHs). These objects make long-duration microlensing events. To characterize these lensing objects by fully resolving the microlensing degeneracy, measurements of parallax and astrometric deflections are necessary. Microlensing events due to ISMBHs have considerable astrometric deflections, but small parallax amplitudes as $\pi_{\rm E} \propto 1/\sqrt{M_{\rm l}}$, where $M_{\rm l}$ is the lens mass. We numerically investigate the possibility of inferring parallax amplitude from astrometric deflection in microlensing events due to ISMBHs. The parallax amplitude in astrometric deflections is proportional to the relative parallax $\pi_{\rm{rel}}$, which means (i) does not strongly depend on $M_{\rm l}$, and (ii) increases in microlensing observations toward the Magellanic Clouds(MCs). We assume these events are potentially detected in upcoming microlensing surveys-(1): the \wfirst\ observations of the Galactic bulge (GB), and (2): the LSST observations of the Large MC(LMC)-, and the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) follows up them with one data point every ten days. We evaluate the probability of inferring parallax amplitude from these observations by calculating the Fisher/Covariance matrices. For GB, the efficiencies for discerning parallax amplitudes with a relative error $<4\%$ through astrometric, and photometric observations are $3.8\%$, and $29.1\%$, respectively. For observations toward the LMC, these efficiencies are $41.1\%$, and $23.0\%$, respectively. Measuring parallax amplitude through astrometric deflections is plausible in the GB events with the lens distance $\lesssim 2.7$kpc, and in the LMC halo-lensing. The ELT telescope by monitoring long-duration microlensing events can detect astrometric deflections, and their parallax-induced deviations.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution, millimeter observations of disks at the protoplanetary stage reveal substructures such as gaps, rings, arcs, spirals, and cavities. While many protoplanetary disks host such substructures, only a few at the younger protostellar stage have shown similar features. We present a detailed search for early disk substructures in ALMA 1.3 and 0.87~mm observations of ten protostellar disks in the Ophiuchus star-forming region. Of this sample, four disks have identified substructure, two appear to be smooth disks, and four are considered ambiguous. The structured disks have wide Gaussian-like rings ($\sigma_R/R_{\mathrm{disk}}\sim0.26$) with low contrasts ($C<0.2$) above a smooth disk profile, in comparison to protoplanetary disks where rings tend to be narrow and have a wide variety of contrasts ($\sigma_R/R_{\mathrm{disk}}\sim0.08$ and $C$ ranges from $0-1$). The four protostellar disks with the identified substructures are among the brightest sources in the Ophiuchus sample, in agreement with trends observed for protoplanetary disks. These observations indicate that substructures in protostellar disks may be common in brighter disks. The presence of substructures at the earliest stages suggests an early start for dust grain growth and, subsequently, planet formation. The evolution of these protostellar substructures is hypothesized in two potential pathways: (1) the rings are the sites of early planet formation, and the later observed protoplanetary disk ring-gap pairs are secondary features, or (2) the rings evolve over the disk lifetime to become those observed at the protoplanetary disk stage.

 - **Abstract**
 eta Telescopii is a ~23 Myr old A-type star surrounded by an edge-on debris disc hypothesised to harbour gas. Recent analysis of far- and near-ultraviolet spectroscopic observations of eta Tel found absorption features at ~-23 km/s and ~-18 km/s in several atomic lines, attributed to circumstellar and interstellar gas, respectively. In this work, we put the circumstellar origin of the gas to a test by analysing high resolution optical spectroscopy of eta Tel and of three other stars with a similar line of sight as eta Tel: HD 181327, HD 180575, and rho Tel. We found absorption features at ~-23 km/s and ~-18 km/s in the Ca ii H&K lines, and at ~-23 km/s in the Na i D1&D2 doublet in eta Tel, in agreement with previous findings in the ultraviolet. However, we also found absorption features at ~-23 km/s in the Ca ii K lines of the three other stars analysed. This strongly implies that the absorption lines previously attributed to circumstellar gas are more likely due to an interstellar cloud traversing the line of sight of eta Tel instead.

 - **Abstract**
 The investigation of primordial non-Gaussianities holds immense importance in testing the inflation paradigm and shedding light on the physics of the early universe. In this study, we conduct the first complete analysis of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) by simultaneously incorporating the local-type non-Gaussianities $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$. To achieve this, we develop a Feynman-like diagrammatic technique and derive semi-analytic formulas for both the energy-density fraction spectrum and the angular power spectrum. For the energy-density fraction spectrum, we meticulously analyze all the relevant Feynman-like diagrams, systematically determining their contributions to the spectrum in an order-by-order fashion. As for the angular power spectrum, our focus lies on the initial inhomogeneities that arise from the coupling between short-wavelength and long-wavelength modes due to primordial non-Gaussianities. These inhomogeneities give rise to anisotropies in SIGWs. Our analysis reveals that this spectrum exhibits a typical multipole dependence, characterized by $\tilde{C}_{\ell}\propto[\ell(\ell+1)]^{-1}$. This dependence plays a crucial role in distinguishing between different sources of gravitational waves. Moreover, depending on the model parameters, significant anisotropies of $\tilde{C}_{\ell}\sim10^{-3}$ can be achieved. Additionally, we demonstrate that the degeneracies in the model parameters can be broken. The findings of our study underscore the power of this spectrum as a robust probe for investigating primordial non-Gaussianities and exploring the physics of the early universe through gravitational-wave observations. Furthermore, the theoretical predictions derived from our research can be experimentally tested using space-borne gravitational-wave detectors and pulsar timing arrays.

 - **Abstract**
 We have systematically investigated ultraviolet (UV) emission from molecular hydrogen (H$_{2}$) using the Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer (IRIS), during three X-ray flares of C5.1, C9.7 and X1.0 classes on Oct. 25, 2014. Significant emission from five H$_{2}$ spectral lines appeared in the flare ribbons, interpreted as photo-excitation (fluorescence) due to the absorption of UV radiation from two Si IV spectral lines. The H$_{2}$ profiles were broad and consisted of two non-stationary components in red and in the blue wings of the line in addition to the stationary component. The red (blue) wing components showed small redshifts (blue shifts) of ~5-15 km s$^{-1}$ (~5-10 km s$^{-1}$). The nonthermal velocities were found to be ~5-15 km s$^{-1}$. The interrelation between intensities of H$_{2}$ lines and their branching ratios confirmed that H$_{2}$ emission formed under optically thin plasma conditions. There is a strong spatial and temporal correlation between Si IV and H$_{2}$ emission, but the H$_{2}$ emission is more extended and diffuse, further suggesting H$_{2}$ fluorescence, and - by analogy with flare ''back-warming'' providing a means to estimate the depth from which the H$_{2}$ emission originates. We find that this is 1871$\pm$157 km and 1207$\pm$112 km below the source of the Si IV emission, in two different ribbon locations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present extensive ultraviolet (UV) and optical photometric and optical spectroscopic follow-up of supernova (SN)~2021gno by the "Precision Observations of Infant Supernova Explosions" (POISE) project, starting less than two days after the explosion. Given its intermediate luminosity, fast photometric evolution, and quick transition to the nebular phase with spectra dominated by [Ca~II] lines, SN~2021gno belongs to the small family of Calcium-rich transients. Moreover, it shows double-peaked light curves, a phenomenon shared with only four other Calcium-rich events. The projected distance from the center of the host galaxy is not as large as other objects in this family. The initial optical light-curve peaks coincide with a very quick decline of the UV flux, indicating a fast initial cooling phase. Through hydrodynamical modelling of the bolometric light curve and line velocity evolution, we found that the observations are compatible with the explosion of a highly-stripped massive star with an ejecta mass of $0.8\,M_\odot$ and a $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.024~M_{\odot}$. The initial cooling phase (first light curve peak) is explained by the presence of an extended circumstellar material comprising $\sim$$10^{-2}\,M_{\odot}$ with an extension of $1100\,R_{\odot}$. We discuss if hydrogen features are present in both maximum-light and nebular spectra, and its implications in terms of the proposed progenitor scenarios for Calcium-rich transients.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we use the merger process of clusters/voids in the role of variable dark energy fluid to alleviate the Hubble tension, which can lead to a balance in the cosmological expansion rate. To reach this target, we will introduce a modified form of energy density for cosmic fluid with the quadratic equation of state, and then we obtain Hubble, deceleration parameters, and luminosity distance for this fluid. To obtain the merger factor and other parameters of our model, we utilize the NONLINEARMODELFIT function within MATHEMATICA. By consideration of the local and global measurements of $\rm H_0$, and the equation of state parameter $w$ as the priory values and fitting our model with Observational Hubble Data (OHD) measurements, we will show that the merger of clusters/voids plays the role of balancing the cosmic expansion rate. Also, it will be shown that the model is more compatible than $w$CDM with the standard model to describe the accelerating universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a new model of the evolution of the concentration of dark matter halos, c(t). For individual halos, our model approximates c(t) as a power law with a time-dependent index, such that at early times, concentration has a nearly constant value of c=3-4, and as cosmic time progresses, c(t) smoothly increases. Using large samples of halo merger trees taken from the Bolshoi-P and MDPL2 cosmological simulations, we demonstrate that our 3-parameter model can approximate the evolution of the concentration of individual halos with a typical accuracy of 0.1 dex for t>2 Gyr for all Bolshoi-P and MDPL2 halos of present-day mass greater than 10^11.5 Msun. We additionally present a new model of the evolution of the concentration of halo populations, which we show faithfully reproduces both average concentration growth, as well as the diversity of smooth trajectories of c(t), including capturing correlations with halo mass and halo assembly history. Our publicly available source code, Diffprof, can be used to generate Monte Carlo realizations of the concentration histories of cosmologically representative halo populations; Diffprof is differentiable due to its implementation in the JAX autodiff library, which facilitates the incorporation of our model into existing analytical halo model frameworks.

 - **Abstract**
 I identify a point-symmetric structure composed of three pairs of clumps in the recently released JWST image of the ejecta of SN 1987A and argue that these pairs of clumps support the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) for SN 1987A. I compare this point-symmetric structure with the multipolar-lobe morphology of a post-asymptotic giant branch nebula. The three pairs of clumps in the post-AGB nebula are formed at the tip of jet-inflated lobes. I use this similarity to strengthen earlier claims that SN 1987A was exploded by jets in the frame of the JJEM.

 - **Abstract**
 The future 21 cm intensity mapping observations constitute a promising way to trace the matter distribution of the Universe and probe cosmology. Here we assess its capability for cosmological constraints using as a case study the BINGO radio telescope, that will survey the Universe at low redshifts ($0.13 < z < 0.45$). We use neural networks (NNs) to map summary statistics, namely, the angular power spectrum (APS) and the Minkowski functionals (MFs), calculated from simulations into cosmological parameters. Our simulations span a wide grid of cosmologies, sampled under the $\Lambda$CDM scenario, {$\Omega_c, h$}, and under an extension assuming the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization, {$\Omega_c, h, w_0, w_a$}. In general, NNs trained over APS outperform those using MFs, while their combination provides 27% (5%) tighter error ellipse in the $\Omega_c-h$ plane under the $\Lambda$CDM scenario (CPL parameterization) compared to the individual use of the APS. Their combination allows predicting $\Omega_c$ and $h$ with 4.9% and 1.6% fractional errors, respectively, which increases to 6.4% and 3.7% under CPL parameterization. Although we find large bias on $w_a$ estimates, we still predict $w_0$ with 24.3% error. We also confirm our results to be robust to foreground contamination, besides finding the instrumental noise to cause the greater impact on the predictions. Still, our results illustrate the capability of future low redshift 21 cm observations in providing competitive cosmological constraints using NNs, showing the ease of combining different summary statistics.
