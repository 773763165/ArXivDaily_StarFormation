 - **Abstract**
 The first stars were born from chemically pristine gas. They were likely massive, and thus they rapidly exploded as supernovae, enriching the surrounding gas with the first heavy elements. In the Local Group, the chemical signatures of the first stellar population were identified among low-mass, long-lived, very metal-poor ([Fe/H]<-2) stars, characterized by high abundances of carbon over iron ([C/Fe]>+0.7): the so-called carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars. Conversely, a similar carbon excess caused by first-star pollution was not found in dense neutral gas traced by absorption systems at different cosmic time. Here we present the detection of 14 very metal-poor, optically thick absorbers at redshift z~3-4. Among these, 3 are carbon-enhanced and reveal an overabundance with respect to Fe of all the analyzed chemical elements (O, Mg, Al, and Si). Their relative abundances show a distribution with respect to [Fe/H] that is in very good agreement with those observed in nearby very metal-poor stars. All the tests we performed support the idea that these C-rich absorbers preserve the chemical yields of the first stars. Our new findings suggest that the first-star signatures can survive in optically thick but relatively diffuse absorbers, which are not sufficiently dense to sustain star formation and hence are not dominated by the chemical products of normal stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We search for the presence of cool cores in optically-selected galaxy clusters from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and investigate their prevalence as a function of redshift and cluster richness. Clusters were selected from the redMaPPer analysis of three years of DES observations that have archival Chandra X-ray observations, giving a sample of 99 clusters with a redshift range of $0.11 < z < 0.87$ and a richness range of $25 < \lambda < 207$. Using the X-ray data, the core temperature was compared to the outer temperature to identify clusters where the core temperature is a factor of 0.7 or less than the outer temperature. We found a cool core fraction of approximately 20% with no significant trend in the cool core fraction with either redshift or richness.

 - **Abstract**
 In binary black-hole mergers from isolated binary-star evolution, both black holes are from progenitor stars that have lost their hydrogen-rich envelopes by binary mass transfer. Envelope stripping is known to affect the pre-supernova core structures of such binary-stripped stars and thereby their final fates and compact remnant masses. In this paper, we show that binary-stripped stars give rise to a bimodal black-hole mass spectrum with characteristic black-hole masses of about $9\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $16\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ across a large range of metallicities. The bimodality is linked to carbon and neon burning becoming neutrino-dominated, which results in interior structures that are difficult to explode and likely lead to black hole formation. The characteristic black-hole masses from binary-stripped stars have corresponding features in the chirp-mass distribution of binary black-hole mergers: peaks at about $8$ and $14\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, and a dearth in between these masses. Current gravitational-wave observations of binary black-hole mergers show evidence for a gap at $10\text{--}12\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and peaks at $8$ and $14\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ in the chirp-mass distribution. These features are in agreement with our models of binary-stripped stars. In the future, they may be used to constrain the physics of late stellar evolution and supernova explosions, and may even help measure the cosmological expansion of the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Most existing exoplanets are discovered using validation techniques rather than being confirmed by complementary observations. These techniques generate a score that is typically the probability of the transit signal being an exoplanet (y(x)=exoplanet) given some information related to that signal (represented by x). Except for the validation technique in Rowe et al. (2014) that uses multiplicity information to generate these probability scores, the existing validation techniques ignore the multiplicity boost information. In this work, we introduce a framework with the following premise: given an existing transit signal vetter (classifier), improve its performance using multiplicity information. We apply this framework to several existing classifiers, which include vespa (Morton et al. 2016), Robovetter (Coughlin et al. 2017), AstroNet (Shallue & Vanderburg 2018), ExoNet (Ansdel et al. 2018), GPC and RFC (Armstrong et al. 2020), and ExoMiner (Valizadegan et al. 2022), to support our claim that this framework is able to improve the performance of a given classifier. We then use the proposed multiplicity boost framework for ExoMiner V1.2, which addresses some of the shortcomings of the original ExoMiner classifier (Valizadegan et al. 2022), and validate 69 new exoplanets for systems with multiple KOIs from the Kepler catalog.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of 288 young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Perseus Molecular Cloud that have well defined $g$ and $r$-band lightcurves from the Zwicky Transient Facility. Of the 288 YSOs, 238 sources (83% of our working sample) are identified as variables based on the normalized peak-to-peak variability metric, with variability fraction of 92% for stars with disks and 77% for the diskless populations. These variables are classified into different categories using the quasiperiodicity ($Q$) and flux asymmetry ($M$) metrics. Fifty-three variables are classified as strictly periodic objects that are well phased and can be attributed to spot modulated stellar rotation. We also identify 22 bursters and 25 dippers, which can be attributed to accretion burst and variable extinction, respectively. YSOs with disks tend to have asymmetric and non-repeatable lightcurves, while the YSOs without disks tend to have (quasi)periodic lightcurves. The periodic variables have the steepest change in $g$ versus $g-r$, while bursters have much flatter changes than dippers in $g$ versus $g-r$. Periodic and quasiperiodic variables display the lowest variability amplitude. Simple models suggest that the variability amplitudes of periodic variables correspond to changes of the spot coverage of 30% to 40%, burster variables are attributed to accretion luminosity changes in the range of $L_{\rm acc}/L_{\star}=0.1-0.3$, and dippers are due to variable extinction with $A_{V}$ changes in the range of $0.5-1.3\;$mag.
#### The Shape of Jupiter and Saturn Based on Atmospheric Dynamics, Radio  Occultations and Gravity Measurements

 - **Abstract**
 The shape of the two gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, is determined primarily by their rotation rate, and interior density distribution. It is also affected by their zonal winds, causing an anomaly of O(10 km) at low latitudes. However, uncertainties in the observed cloud-level wind and the polar radius, translate to an uncertainty in the shape with the same order of magnitude. The Juno (Jupiter) and Cassini (Saturn) missions gave unprecedented accurate gravity measurements, constraining better the uncertainty in the wind structure. Using an accurate shape calculation, and a joint optimization, given both gravity and radio-occultation measurements, we calculate the possible range of dynamical height for both planets. We find that for Saturn there is an excellent match to the radio-occultation measurements, while at Jupiter such a match is not achieved. This may point to deviations from a barotropic flow above the cloud level, which might be tested with the forthcoming radio-occultation measurements by Juno.

 - **Abstract**
 An unprecedented array of new observational capabilities are starting to yield key constraints on models of the epoch of first light in the Universe. In this Letter we discuss the implications of the UV radiation background at cosmic dawn inferred by recent JWST observations for radio experiments aimed at detecting the redshifted 21-cm hyperfine transition of diffuse neutral hydrogen. Under the basic assumption that the 21-cm signal is activated by the Ly$\alpha$ photon field produced by metal-poor stellar systems, we show that a detection at the low frequencies of the EDGES experiment may be expected from a simple extrapolation of the declining UV luminosity density estimated at $z\lesssim 14$ by JWST early galaxy data. Our findings raise the intriguing possibility that a high star formation efficiency at early times may trigger the onset of intense Ly$\alpha$ emission at redshift $z\lesssim 18$ and produce a cosmic 21-cm absorption signal 200 Myr after the Big Bang.
#### Star Formation History of the Small Magellanic Cloud: the shell  substructure

 - **Abstract**
 We present the spatially resolved star formation history (SFH) of a shell-like structure located in the northeastern Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We quantitatively obtain the SFH using unprecedented deep photometric data (g~24 magnitude) from the SMASH survey and colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting techniques. We consider, for the first time, the SMC's line-of-sight depth and its optical effects on the CMDs. The SFH presents higher accuracy when a line-of-sight depth of ~3 Kpc is simulated. We find young star formation enhancements at ~150 Myr, ~200 Myr, ~450 Myr, ~650 Myr, and ~1 Gyr. Comparing the shell's SFH with the Large Magellanic Cloud's (LMC) northern arm SFH we show strong evidence of synchronicity from at least the past ~2.8 Gyr and, possibly, the past ~3.5 Gyr. Our results place constraints on the orbital history of the Magellanic Clouds which, potentially, have implications on their dynamical mass estimates.

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST/NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of MACS0647-JD, the triply-lensed $z \sim 11$ candidate discovered in HST imaging and spatially resolved by JWST imaging into two components A and B. Spectroscopy of component A yields a spectroscopic redshift $z=10.17$ based on 7 detected emission lines: CIII] $\lambda\lambda$1907,1909, [OII] $\lambda$3727, [NeIII] $\lambda$3869, [NeIII] $\lambda$3968, H$\delta$ $\lambda$4101, H$\gamma$ $\lambda$4340, and [OIII] $\lambda$4363. These are the second-most distant detections of these emission lines to date, in a galaxy observed just 460 million years after the Big Bang. Based on observed and extrapolated line flux ratios we derive a gas-phase metallicity $Z =$ log(O/H) = $7.5 - 8.0$, or $(0.06 - 0.2)$ $Z_\odot$, ionization parameter log($U$) $\sim -1.9\pm0.2$, and an ionizing photon production efficiency ${\rm log}(\xi_{\rm ion})=25.2\pm0.2\,$erg$^{-1}$ Hz. The spectrum has a softened Lyman-$\alpha$ break, evidence for a strong Ly$\alpha$ damping wing, suggesting that MACS0647-JD was unable to ionize its surroundings beyond its immediate vicinity ($R_{\text{HII}} \ll 1$ pMpc). The Ly$\alpha$ damping wing also suppresses the F150W photometry, explaining the slightly overestimated photometric redshift $z = 10.6 \pm 0.3$. MACS0647-JD has a stellar mass log($M/M_\odot$) = $8.1 \pm 0.3$, including $\sim$ 6$\times 10^7 M_\odot$ in component A, most of which formed recently (within $\sim$ 20 Myr) with a star formation rate $2\pm1 M_\odot$ / yr, all within an effective radius $70\pm24\,$pc. The smaller component B ($r \sim 20$) pc is likely older ($\sim$100 Myr) with more dust ($A_V \sim 0.1$ mag), as found previously. Spectroscopy of a fainter companion galaxy C separated by a distance of \about\ 3$\,$kpc reveals a Lyman break consistent with $z = 10.17$. MACS0647-JD is likely the most distant galaxy merger known.
