 - **Abstract**
 The tidal deformability and the radius of neutron stars are observables, which have been used to constrain the neutron star equation of state and explore the composition in neutron stars. We investigated the radius and tidal deformability of dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANSs) by utilizing the two-fluid TOV equations. Assuming that the dark matter modeled as ideal fermi gas or self-interacting bosons, for a series of DANSs at a fixed mass, it is shown that there exists the DANSs with smaller normal matter radii but larger tidal deformabilities. This negative correlation does not exist in the normal neutron stars.In other words, if the observation finds that the neutron stars with a fixed mass exists such a situation, that is, having a smaller observed radius but a larger tidal deformability, it will indicate the existence of dark matter in neutron stars.In addition, the relevant neutron star observations can also be used to constrain the dark matter parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 The Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL) is a free online registry for source codes of interest to astronomers, astrophysicists, and planetary scientists. It lists, and in some cases houses, software that has been used in research appearing in or submitted to peer-reviewed publications. As of December 2023, it has over 3300 software entries and is indexed by NASA's Astrophysics Data System (ADS) and Clarivate's Web of Science. In 2020, NASA created the Exoplanet Modeling and Analysis Center (EMAC). Housed at the Goddard Space Flight Center, EMAC serves, in part, as a catalog and repository for exoplanet research resources. EMAC has 240 entries (as of December 2023), 78% of which are for downloadable software. This oral presentation covered the collaborative work the ASCL, EMAC, and ADS are doing to increase the discoverability and citability of EMAC's software entries and to strengthen the ASCL's ability to serve the planetary science community. It also introduced two new projects, Virtual Astronomy Software Talks (VAST) and Exoplanet Virtual Astronomy Software Talks (exoVAST), that provide additional opportunities for discoverability of EMAC software resources.
#### Time variability of ultra-fast BAL outflows using SALT: C IV absorption  depth based analysis
 - **Authors:** P. Aromal, R. Srianand, P. Petitjean
 - **Subjects:** Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17320
 - **Abstract**
 We probe the small-scale absorption line variability using absorption depth based analysis of a sample of 64 ultra-fast outflow (UFO) C IV broad absorption line (BAL) quasars monitored using the Southern African Large Telescope. We confirm the strong monotonic increase in the strength of variability with increasing outflow velocity. We identify regions inside the BAL trough for each source where the normalized flux difference between two epochs is $>$0.1 for a velocity width $\ge$500 kms$^{-1}$ (called ``variable regions"). We find the total number of variable regions increases with the time interval probed and the number of BALs showing variable regions almost doubles from short ($<$2 yrs) to long ($>$2 yrs) time scales. We study the distributions of variable region properties such as its velocity width, depth, and location. These regions typically occupy a few-tenths of the entire width of the BAL. Their widths are found to increase with increasing time scales having typical widths of ~2000 kms$^{-1}$ for dt $>$ 2 yr. However, their absolute velocity with respect to z$_{em}$ and their relative position within the BAL profile remain random irrespective of the time scale probed. The equivalent width variations of the BALs are strongly dependent on the size and depth of the variable regions but are little dependent on their total number. Finally, we find that ~17% of the UFO BALs show uncorrelated variability within the BAL trough.
#### Recovering the Missing Large-Scale Density Modes in 21cm Intensity Map  from the Scalar-Type Clustering Fossils

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17321
 - **Abstract**
 Revealing the large-scale structure from the 21cm intensity mapping surveys is only possible after the foreground cleaning. However, most current cleaning techniques relying on the smoothness of the foreground spectrum lead to a severe side effect of removing the large-scale structure signal along the line of sight. On the other hand, the clustering fossil, a coherent variation of the small-scale clustering over large scales, allows us to recover the long-wavelength density modes from the off-diagonal correlation between short-wavelength modes. In this paper, we study the requirements for an unbiased and optimal clustering-fossil estimator and show that (A) the estimator is unbiased only when using an accurate bispectrum model for the long-short-short mode coupling and (B) including the connected four-point correlation functions is essential for characterizing the noise power spectrum of the estimated long mode. The clustering fossil estimator based upon the leading-order bispectrum yields an unbiased estimation of the long-wavelength ($k\lesssim 0.01~[h/{\rm Mpc}]$) modes with the cross-correlation coefficient of $0.7$ at redshifts $z=0$ to $3$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Balloon Experiment for Galactic INfrared Science (BEGINS) is a concept for a sub-orbital observatory that will operate from $\lambda$ = 25-250 $\mu$m to characterize dust in the vicinity of high-mass stars. The mission's sensitivity requirements will be met by utilizing arrays of 1,840 lens-coupled, lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) operating at 300 mK. Each KID will consist of a titanium nitride (TiN) parallel strip absorbing inductive section and parallel plate capacitor (PPC) deposited on a silicon (Si) substrate. The PPC geometry allows for reduction of the pixel spacing. At the BEGINS focal plane the detectors require optical NEPs from $2\times10^{-16}$ W/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ to $6\times10^{-17}$ W/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ from 25-250 $\mu$m for optical loads ranging from 4 pW to 10 pW. We present the design, optical performance and quasiparticle lifetime measurements of a prototype BEGINS KID array at 25 $\mu$m when coupled to Fresnel zone plate lenses. For our optical set up and the absorption efficiency of the KIDs, the electrical NEP requirement at 25 $\mu$m is $7.6\times10^{-17}$ W/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ for an absorbed optical power of 0.36 pW. We find that over an average of five resonators the the detectors are photon noise limited down to about 200 fW, with a limiting NEP of about $7.4\times10^{-17}$ W/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the discovery of the first hot Jupiter orbiting a solar-type star, 51 Peg, in 1995, more than 4000 exoplanets have been identified using various observational techniques. The formation process of these sub-Earths remains elusive, and acquiring additional samples is essential for investigating this unique population. In our study, we employ a novel GPU Phase Folding algorithm combined with a Convolutional Neural Network, termed the GPFC method, on Kepler photometry data. This method enhances the transit search speed significantly over the traditional Box-fitting Least Squares method, allowing a complete search of the known KOI photometry data within hours using a commercial GPU card. To date, we have identified five promising sub-Earth short-period candidates: K00446.c, K01821.b, K01522.c, K03404.b, and K04978.b. A closer analysis reveals the following characteristics: K00446.c orbits a K dwarf on a 0.645091-day period. With a radius of $0.461R_\oplus$, it ranks as the second smallest USP discovered to date. K01821.b is a sub-Earth with a radius of $0.648R_\oplus$, orbiting a G dwarf over a 0.91978-day period. It is the second smallest USP among all confirmed USPs orbiting G dwarfs in the NASA Archive. K01522.c has a radius of $0.704 R_\oplus$ and completes an orbit around a Sun-like G dwarf in 0.64672 days; K03404.b, with a radius of $0.738 R_\oplus$, orbits a G dwarf on a 0.68074-day period; and K04978.b, with its planetary radius of $0.912 R_\oplus$, orbits a G dwarf, completing an orbit every 0.94197 days. Three of our finds, K01821.b, K01522.c and K03404.b, rank as the smallest planets among all confirmed USPs orbiting G dwarfs in the Kepler dataset. The discovery of these small exoplanets underscores the promising capability of the GPFC method for searching for small, new transiting exoplanets in photometry data from Kepler, TESS, and future space transit missions.

 - **Abstract**
 Changes in the flux and spectrum of Eta Carinae since 1900 have been attributed to the evolution of the central binary by some. Others suggest evolution in the occulting ejecta. The brightness jump in the 1940s, which coincided with the appearance of narrow forbidden emission lines, may have been caused by the clearing and ionization of intervening circumstellar ejecta. The brightening changed at a slower pace up through forty years later. Here we continue earlier studies focused on the long-term showing that the forbidden line emission increased in the early 1990s with no noticeable increase in the brightness of the Homunculus. We interpret that the increase in narrow line emission is due to decreased extinction in the LOS from the central binary to the Weigelt clumps. In 2000, the central stellar core increased in brightness at a faster rate without associated changes in the Homunculus. By 2018, hundreds of narrow-line absorptions from singly-ionized metals in our LOS from Eta Carinae disappeared, thought to be caused by increased ionization of metals. These three events (1990, 2000, and 2018) are explained by the dissipation of circumstellar material within the Homunculus close to the binary. Combining these changes with the steadiness of the Homunculus and the primary winds over the past four decades indicates that circumstellar ejecta in our direction have been cleared.
#### Surveys of clumps, cores, and condensations in Cygnus-X:Searching for  circumstellar disks

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate whether disk-mediated accretion is the primary mechanism in high-mass star formation, we have established a survey of a large sample of massive dense cores within a giant molecular cloud. We used high angular resolution ($\sim 1.8''$) observations with SMA to study the dust emission and molecular line emission of about 50 massive dense cores in Cygnus-X. At a typical distance of 1.4 kpc for Cygnus-X, these massive dense cores are resolved into $\sim 2000$ au condensations. We combined the CO outflow emission and gas kinematics traced by several high-density tracers to search for disk candidates. We extracted hundreds of dust condensations from the SMA 1.3 mm dust continuum emission. The CO data show bipolar or unipolar outflow signatures toward 49 dust condensations. Among them, only 27 sources are detected in dense gas tracers, which reveals the gas kinematics, and nine sources show evidence of rotating envelopes, suggesting the existence of embedded accretion disks. The position-velocity diagrams along the velocity gradient of all rotating condensations suggest that four condensations are possible to host Keplerian-like disks. A detailed investigation of the 27 sources detected in dense gas tracers suggests that the nine disk candidates are at earlier evolutionary stages compared to the remaining 18 sources. Non-detection of rotating disks in our sample may be due to several factors, including an unknown inclination angle of the rotation axis and an early evolutionary stage of the central source, and the latter could be important, considering that young and powerful outflows could confuse the observational evidence for rotation. The detection rate of disk candidates in our sample is 1/3, which confirms that disk accretion is a viable mechanism for high-mass star formation, although it may not be the only one.

 - **Abstract**
 The observations of gravitational waves (GWs) have revealed the existence of black holes (BHs) above $30M_\odot$. A variety of scenarios have been proposed as their origin. Among the scenarios, we consider the population III (Pop~III) star scenario. In this scenario, binary black holes (BBHs) containing such massive BHs are naturally produced. We consider Pop~I/II field binaries, Pop~III field binaries and the binaries dynamically formed in globular clusters. We employ a hierarchical Bayesian analysis method and constrain the branching fraction of each formation channel in our universe by using the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational wave transient catalog (GWTC-3) events. We find that the Pop~I/II field binary channel dominates the entire merging BBHs. We obtain the branching fraction of the Pop~III BBH channel of $0.11^{+0.08}_{-0.06}$, which gives the consistent local merger rate density with the model of Pop~III BBH scenario we adopt. We confirm that BHs arising from the Pop~III channel contribute to massive BBHs in GWTC-3. We also evaluate the branching fraction of each formation channel in the observed BBHs in the GWTC-3 and find the near-equal contributions from the three channels.

 - **Abstract**
 We argue that the lensing power spectrum of astrometric shift (lensing shift power spectrum) is a powerful tool of the clustering property of dark matter on subgalactic scales. First we give the formalism to probe the nature of dark matter by using the lensing shift power spectrum. Then, leveraging recent measurements of the lensing shift power spectrum on an angular scale of approximately $1~$arcsec towards the gravitationally lensed quasar MG$\,$J0414+0534 at the redshift of $z_S=2.639$, we place constraints on the mass of warm dark matter (WDM) particles $m_{\rm WDM}$ and their fraction in a mixed dark matter (MDM) model $r_{\rm WDM}$, in which WDM and cold dark matter coexist. Although the constraint derived from the above single lensing system is not as strong as the existing constraints, as we show in this paper, the lensing shift power spectrum has a great potential to obtain much tighter constraints on WDM and MDM models through future observations, highlighting the importance of well-controlled systematic error considerations for achieving enhanced precision.
#### Cluster Formation in a Filamentary Cloud: The Case of the Stellar  Cluster NGC 2316

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-wavelength analysis of the star cluster NGC 2316 and its surroundings. We estimated the physical parameters of the NGC 2316 cluster, including its shape (elongated), size (Rcluster = 0.4 pc), distance (1.3 +/- 0.3 kpc), and minimum reddening (AV = 1.55 mag). We discovered two massive stars (B2.0V-B1.5V, age ~12 Myr) embedded (AV = 4 mag) within this cluster. The cluster region still forms young stars even though the most massive star was born ~12 Myr ago. We also found evidence of positive feedback from these massive stars. We identified a cold gas/dust lane extending westward from the cluster. The western end of the dust lane seems to favor low-mass star formation, whereas the cluster's end favors bit massive star formation, which seems to have started earlier than the western end. We found an elongated molecular cloud in this region, characterized by numerous filamentary structures. The morphology of the filaments, along with position-velocity (pv) maps, velocity dispersion maps, channel maps, etc., indicate a coalescence of filaments and a potential longitudinal flow of matter toward the cluster through the western end of the gas/dust lane. This entire region seems to be a Hub-filamentary system (HFS), in which the NGC 2316 cluster is probably the hub and the dark lane is the main filamentary structure. Being the gravity well of this HFS, star formation started first in the NGC 2316 region and went on to the other filamentary nodes.
