 - **Abstract**
 We report on the properties of central engines in the $\gamma$-ray blazars located at high redshifts beyond z~>~0.4, where the extra-galactic background light (EBL) starts affecting their $\gamma$-ray spectra. The physical engine that provides power to the blazars of very high bolometric luminosity is assumed to be a highly collimated jet of matter moving relativistically away from the supermassive black hole (SMBH), located in the central region of the host galaxy, in a direction aligned toward the Earth. Due to their peculiar geometry and special physical conditions, blazars at redshifts beyond z~>~0.4 are bright enough to be detected in the $\gamma$-ray energy band. In this work, we investigate the physical properties of high-$z$ $\gamma$-ray blazars detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the \emph{Fermi} satellite. We also study the properties of their emission regions and the central engines and discuss cosmological and astrophysical implications.

 - **Abstract**
 Recycled millisecond pulsars are susceptible to starquakes as they are continuously accreting matter from their binary companion. A starquake happens when the rotational frequency of the star crosses its breaking frequency. In this study, we perform a model analysis of an accreting neutron star suffering a starquake. We analyze two models: a spherical star with accreting mountains and a deformed star with accreting mountains. We find that as the star crosses the breaking frequency and suffers a starquake there is a sudden change in the continuous gravitational wave signal arriving from them. It is interesting to note that the amplitude of the gravitational wave signals increases suddenly for the spherical star. In contrast, for the deformed star, the amplitude of the continuous gravitational wave signal decreases suddenly. This sudden change in the continuous gravitational wave signal in recycled millisecond pulsars can be a unique signature for such pulsars undergoing a starquake.

 - **Abstract**
 The simulation of heavy element nucleosynthesis requires input from yet-to-be-measured nuclear properties. The uncertainty in the values of these off-stability nuclear properties propagates to uncertainties in the predictions of elemental and isotopic abundances. However, for any given astrophysical explosion, there are many different trajectories, i.e. temperature and density histories, experienced by outflowing material and thus different nuclear properties can come into play. We consider combined nucleosynthesis results from 460,000 trajectories from a neutron star-black hole accretion disk and the find spread in elemental predictions due solely to unknown nuclear properties to be a factor of a few. We analyze this relative spread in model predictions due to nuclear variations and conclude that the uncertainties can be attributed to a combination of properties in a given region of the abundance pattern. We calculate a cross-correlation between mass changes and abundance changes to show how variations among the properties of participating nuclei may be explored. Our results provide further impetus for measurements of multiple quantities on individual short-lived neutron-rich isotopes at modern experimental facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Evidence suggests that when compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars form, they may receive a ``natal kick,'' where the stellar remnant gains momentum. Observational evidence for neutron star kicks is substantial, yet limited for black hole natal kicks, and some proposed black hole formation scenarios result in very small kicks. Here, we report the discovery that the canonical black hole low-mass X-ray binary V404 Cygni is part of a wide hierarchical triple with a tertiary companion at least 3500 astronomical units away from the inner binary. Given the orbital configuration, the black hole likely received a sub-5 kilometer per second kick to have avoided unbinding the tertiary. This discovery reveals that at least some black holes form with nearly no natal kick. Furthermore, the tertiary in this system lends credence to evolutionary models of low-mass X-ray binaries involving a hierarchical triple structure. Remarkably, the tertiary is evolved, indicating that the system formed 3-5 billion years ago, and that the black hole has removed at least half a solar mass of matter from its evolved secondary companion. During the event in which the black hole formed, it is likely that at least half of the mass of the black hole progenitor collapsed into the black hole; it may even have undergone a complete implosion, enabling the tertiary to remain loosely bound.
#### An overlooked source of uncertainty in the mass of the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 In the conventional approach to decomposing a rotation curve into a set of contributions from mass model components, the measurements of the rotation curve at different radii are taken to be independent. It is clear, however, that radial correlations are present in such data, for instance (but not only) because the orbital speed depends on the mass distribution at all (or, minimally, inner) radii. We adopt a very simple parametric form for a covariance matrix and constrain its parameters using Gaussian process regression. Applied to the rotation curve of the Milky Way, this suggests the presence of correlations between neighbouring rotation curve points with amplitudes $<10\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ over length scales of $1.5$-$2.5\,\mathrm{kpc}$ regardless of the assumed dark halo component. We show that accounting for such covariance can result in a $\sim 50$ per cent lower total mass estimate for the Milky Way than when it is neglected, and that the statistical uncertainty associated with the covariance is comparable to or exceeds the total systematic uncertainty budget. Our findings motivate including more detailed treatment of rotation curve covariance in future analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 With four companions at separations from 16 to 71 au, HR 8799 is a unique target for direct imaging, presenting an opportunity for the comparative study of exoplanets with a shared formation history. Combining new VLTI/GRAVITY observations obtained within the ExoGRAVITY program with archival data, we perform a systematic atmospheric characterisation of all four planets. We explore different levels of model flexibility to understand the temperature structure, chemistry and clouds of each planet using both petitRADTRANS atmospheric retrievals and fits to self-consistent radiative-convective equilibrium models. Using Bayesian Model Averaging to combine multiple retrievals, we find that the HR 8799 planets are highly enriched in metals, with [M/H] $\gtrsim$1, and have stellar to super-stellar C/O ratios. The C/O ratio increases with increasing separation from $0.55^{+0.12}_{-0.10}$ for d to $0.78^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ for b, with the exception of the innermost planet which has a C/O ratio of $0.87\pm0.03$. By retrieving a quench pressure and using a disequilibrium chemistry model we derive vertical mixing strengths compatible with predictions for high-metallicity, self-luminous atmospheres. Bayesian evidence comparisons strongly favour the presence of HCN in HR 8799 c and e, as well as CH$_{4}$ in HR 8799 c, with detections at $>5\sigma$ confidence. All of the planets are cloudy, with no evidence for patchiness. The clouds of c, d and e are best fit by silicate clouds lying above a deep iron cloud layer, while the clouds of the cooler HR 8799 b are more likely composed of Na$_{2}$S. With well defined atmospheric properties, future exploration of this system is well positioned to unveil further detail in these planets, extending our understanding of the composition, structure, and formation history of these siblings.
#### Accretion and Uneven Depletion of the Main Asteroid Belt

 - **Abstract**
 The main asteroid belt (MAB) is known to be primarily composed of objects from two distinct taxonomic classes, generically defined here as S- and C-complex. The former probably originated from the inner solar system (interior to Jupiter's orbit), while the latter probably from the outer solar system. Following this definition, (4) Vesta, a V-type residing in the inner MAB (a < 2.5 au), is the sole D > 500 km object akin to S-complex that potentially formed in-situ. This provides a useful constraint on the number of D > 500 km bodies that could have formed, or grown, within the primordial MAB. In this work we numerically simulate the accretion of objects in the MAB region during the time when gas in the protoplanetary disk still existed, while assuming different MAB primordial masses. We then accounted for the depletion of that population happening after gas disk dispersal. In our analysis, we subdivided the MAB into five sub-regions and showed that the depletion factor varies throughout the MAB. This results in uneven radial- and size-dependent depletion of the MAB. We show that the MAB primordial mass has to be $\lesssim$ 2.14$\times$10$^{-3}$ Earth masses. Larger primordial masses would lead to the accretion of tens-to-thousands of S-complex objects with D > 500 km in the MAB. Such large objects would survive depletion even in the outer sub-regions (a > 2.5 au), thus being inconsistent with observations. Our results also indicate that S-complex objects with D > 200-300 km, including (4) Vesta, are likely to be terrestrial planetesimals implanted into the MAB rather than formed in-situ.
#### Reevaluating the Origin of Detectable Cataclysmic Variables in Globular  Clusters: Testing the Importance of Dynamics

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03796
 - **Abstract**
 Based on the current detectable cataclysmic variable (CV) population in Galactic globular clusters (GCs), we show that there is not a clear relation between the number of sources per unit of mass and the stellar encounter rate, the cluster mass, or the cluster central density. If any, only in the case of core-collapsed GCs could there be an anticorrelation with the stellar encounter rate. Our findings contrast with previous studies where clear positive correlations were identified. Our results suggest that correlations between faint X-ray sources, from which often conclusions for the CV population are drawn, and the GC parameters considered here, are likely influenced by other type of X-ray sources, including other types of compact binaries, which have X-ray luminosities similar to CVs. The findings presented here also suggest that the role of primordial systems is more important than previously believed and that dynamical formation has less influence in the current detectable CV population. The long-standing paradigm that GCs are efficient factories of CVs formed via dynamical interactions does not seem to be supported by current observations.
#### The Critical Mass Ratio for W UMa-type Contact Binary Systems

 - **Abstract**
 Contact binaries are close binary systems in which both components fill their inner Roche lobes so that the stars are in direct contact and in potential mass and energy exchange. The most common such systems of low-mass are the so-called W UMa-type. In the last few years, there is a growing interest of the astronomical community in stellar mergers, primarily due to the detection of gravitational waves (mergers of black holes and neutron stars), but also because of an alternative model for type Ia supernovae (merger of two white dwarfs), which are again particularly important in cosmology where they played an important role in the discovery of dark energy and the accelerated expansion of the Universe. In that sense, contact systems of W UMa-type with extremely low mass ratio are especially interesting because there are indications that in their case, too, stars can merge and possible form fast-rotating stars such as FC Com stars and the blue-stragglers, and (luminous) red novae such as V1309 Sco. Namely, previous theoretical research has shown that in the cases when the orbital angular momentum of the system is only about three times larger than the rotational angular momentum of the primary, a tidal Darwin's instability occurs, the components can no longer remain in synchronous rotation, orbit continue to shrink fast and they finally merge into a single star. The above stability condition for contact systems can be linked to some critical mass ratio below which we expect a system to be unstable. We give an overview of this condition and show how it can be used to identify potential mergers. Finally, we discuss a number of known extreme mass ratio binaries from the literature and prospect for future research on this topic.

 - **Abstract**
 FarView is an early-stage concept for a large, low-frequency radio observatory, manufactured in-situ on the lunar far side using metals extracted from the lunar regolith. It consists of 100,000 dipole antennas in compact subarrays distributed over a large area but with empty space between subarrays in a core-halo structure. FarView covers a total area of ~200 km2, has a dense core within the inner ~36 km2, and a ~power-law falloff of antenna density out to ~14 km from the center. With this design, it is relatively easy to identify multiple viable build sites on the lunar far side. The science case for FarView emphasizes the unique capabilities to probe the unexplored Cosmic Dark Ages - identified by the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey as the discovery area for cosmology. FarView will deliver power spectra and tomographic maps tracing the evolution of the Universe from before the birth of the first stars to the beginning of Cosmic Dawn, and potentially provide unique insights into dark matter, early dark energy, neutrino masses, and the physics of inflation. What makes FarView feasible and affordable in the timeframe of the 2030s is that it is manufactured in-situ, utilizing space industrial technologies. This in-situ manufacturing architecture utilizes Earth-built equipment that is transported to the lunar surface to extract metals from the regolith and will use those metals to manufacture most of the array components: dipole antennas, power lines, and silicon solar cell power systems. This approach also enables a long functional lifetime, by permitting servicing and repair of the observatory. The full 100,000 dipole FarView observatory will take 4 - 8 years to build, depending on the realized performance of the manufacturing elements and the lunar delivery scenario.
#### INvestigations of massive Filaments ANd sTar formation (INFANT). I. Core  Identification and Core Mass Function

 - **Abstract**
 Filamentary structures are ubiquitously found in high-mass star-forming clouds. To investigate the relationship between filaments and star formation, we carry out the INFANT (INvestigations of massive Filaments ANd sTar formation) survey, a multi-scale, multi-wavelength survey of massive filamentary clouds with ALMA band 3/band 6 and VLA K band. In this first paper, we present the ALMA band 6 continuum observations toward a sample of 8 high-mass star forming filaments. We covered each target with approximately rectangular mosaic field of view with two 12-m array configurations, achieving an angular resolution of $\sim$0.6" (2700 AU at 4.5 kpc) and a continuum rms of $\sim$0.1 mJy/beam ($\sim$0.06 Msun in gas mass assuming 15 K). We identify cores using the getsf and astrodendro and find the former is more robust in terms of both identification and measuring flux densities. We identify in total 183 dense cores (15--36 cores in each cloud) and classify their star formation states via outflow and warm gas tracers. The protostellar cores are statistically more massive than the prestellar cores, possibly indicating further accretion onto cores after formation of protostars. For the high-mass end ($M_\text{core}$ $>$ 1.5 Msun) of the core mass function (CMF) we derive a power-law index of $-$1.15 $\pm$ 0.12 for the whole sample, and $-$1.70 $\pm$ 0.25 for the prestellar population. We also find a steepening trend in CMF with cloud evolution ($-$0.89 $\pm$ 0.15 for the young group v.s. $-$1.44 $\pm$ 0.25 for the evolved group) and discuss its implication for cluster formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The development of spectroscopic survey telescopes like Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment and Sloan Digital Sky Survey has opened up unprecedented opportunities for stellar classification. Specific types of stars, such as early-type emission-line stars and those with stellar winds, can be distinguished by the profiles of their spectral lines. In this paper, we introduce a method based on derivative spectroscopy (DS) designed to detect signals within complex backgrounds and provide a preliminary estimation of curve profiles. This method exhibits a unique advantage in identifying weak signals and unusual spectral line profiles when compared to other popular line detection methods. We validated our approach using synthesis spectra, demonstrating that DS can detect emission signals three times fainter than Gaussian fitting. Furthermore, we applied our method to 579,680 co-added spectra from LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey, identifying 16,629 spectra with emission peaks around the H{\alpha} line from 10,963 stars. These spectra were classified into three distinct morphological groups, resulting in nine subclasses as follows. (1) Emission peak above the pseudo-continuum line (single peak, double peaks, emission peak situated within an absorption line, P Cygni profile, Inverse P Cygni profile); (2) Emission peak below the pseudo-continuum line (sharp emission peak, double absorption peaks, emission peak shifted to one side of the absorption line); (3) Emission peak between the pseudo-continuum line.

 - **Abstract**
 More than a thousand warm debris disks have been detected as infrared excess at mid-infrared wavelengths, and their frequencies have been obtained for various spectral types of stars. However, the dependence of the frequencies on spectral type is still debated because the number of stars with significant and detectable infrared excess is limited. Herein, we present the largest systematic search for infrared excess using data from Gaia, WISE, and Spitzer. We identified 373, 485, and 255-reliable infrared excesses in the mid-infrared archival data at wavelengths of 12, 22, and 24 $\mu$m for WISE/$W3$, $W4$, and Spitzer/MIPS ch1, respectively. Although we confirmed that more massive stars tend to show higher frequencies of debris disks, these disk frequencies are relatively flat for both low- and intermediate-mass stars, with a jump at 7000 K for all three wavelengths. Assuming that bright, warm debris disks have lifetimes of a few to several hundred million years, the disk frequency can be understood as the ratio between the timescale and the upper limits of the sample ages. We also found that intermediate-mass stars with infrared excess tend to be bluer and fainter along the evolutionary track than those without, implying that massive stars hosting debris disks are relatively young, with an isochronal age of approximately 500 Myr. These tendencies are reasonably explained by a standard scenario in which debris disks are likely to be produced by collisions of planetesimals in early stages of stellar evolution, such as the Late Heavy Bombardment.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the formation of high-redshift supermassive black holes (SMBHs) via the direct collapse of baryonic clouds, where the necessary formation of molecular hydrogen is supressed by a Lyman-Werner (LW) photon background from relic particle decay. We improve on existing studies by dynamically simulating the collapse, accounting for the adiabatic contraction of the DM halo, as well as the in-situ production of the LW photons within the cloud which reduce the impact of the cloud's shielding. We find a viable parameter space where the decay of either some or all of the dark matter could successfully lead to the direct collapse of a SMBH.

 - **Abstract**
 EC 19529-4430 was identified as a helium-rich star in the Edinburgh-Cape Survey of faint-blue objects and subsequently resolved as a metal-poor extreme helium (EHe) star in the SALT survey of chemically-peculiar hot subdwarfs. This paper presents a fine analysis of the SALT high-resolution spectrum. EC 19529-4430 has $T_{\rm eff} = 20\,700 \pm250$\,K, $\log g /{\rm cm\,s^{-2}} = 3.49\pm0.03$, and an overall metallicity some 1.3 dex below solar; surface hydrogen is $\approx 0.5\%$ by number. The surface CNO ratio 1:100:8 implies that the surface consists principally of CNO-processed helium and makes EC 19529-4430 the coolest known carbon-poor and nitrogen-rich EHe star. Metal-rich analogues include V652 Her and GALEX J184559.8-413827. Kinematically, its retrograde orbit indicates membership of the galactic halo. No pulsations were detected in TESS photometry and there is no evidence for a binary companion. EC 19529-4430 most likely formed from the merging of two helium white dwarfs, which themselves formed as a binary system some 11 Gyr ago.
#### Ultra-deep cover: an exotic and jetted tidal disruption event candidate  disguised as a gamma-ray burst

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are traditionally classified as either short GRBs with durations $\lesssim 2$ s that are powered by compact object mergers, or long GRBs with durations $\gtrsim 2$ s that powered by the deaths of massive stars. Recent results, however, have challenged this dichotomy and suggest that there exists a population of merger-driven long bursts. One such example, GRB 191019A, has a $t_{90} \approx 64$ s but many of its other properties -- including its host galaxy, afterglow luminosity and lack of associated supernova -- are more consistent with a short GRB. Here we propose an alternative interpretation: that GRB 191019A (which is located in the nucleus of its host) is an atypical jetted tidal disruption event (TDE). In particular, we suggest the short timescale and rapid decline, not expected for standard TDEs, are the result of an "ultra-deep" encounter, in which the star came well within the tidal radius of the black hole and promptly self-intersected, circularised, accreted, and launched a relativistic outflow. This model reproduces the timescale and luminosity through a prompt super-Eddington accretion phase and accounts for the lack of late optical emission. This would make GRB 191019A only the fifth jetted TDE and the first discovered ultra-deep TDE. The ultra-deep TDE model can be distinguished from merger-driven long GRBs via the soft X-ray flash that results from prompt self-intersection of the debris stream; the detection of this flash will be possible with wide-field and soft-X-ray satellites such as $\textit{Einstein Probe}$ or $\textit{SVOM}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of equation of state for the matter in the neutron star plays an important role in determining its maximal mass. In addition, it must comply with the condition of causality. Noting that the central density of a maximally massive neutron star is well above the nuclear saturation density, a deconfined quark core in the central region is motivated in this paper. We analyze this scenario by employing the MIT bag model to represent the core region and one of the unified equations of state for the region outside the core. Such combination is found to solve the problem of causality violation. In each case of the combined equations of state, the radial profile of $\rho r^2$ displays a peak and dominant contribution to the total mass of the star comes from the region around the peak value of $\rho r^2$, whereas the contribution is small from the regions near the center and the surface. This peak occurs in the region of hadronic matter for the combinations considered in this paper. Importantly, we find that the position of the peak in $\rho r^2$ is well-correlated with the maximal mass -- the highest value of $1.98\ M_\odot$ obtains for the case with the peak occurring farthest from the center. This gravitational threshold being obtained for a non-rotating neutron star, we expect the threshold to lie well above 2 $ M_\odot$ for a rapidly rotating neutron star, that may explain the existance of massive pulsars from recent astronomical observations.

 - **Abstract**
 There is plenty of evidence in the literature of significant discrepancies between the observations and models of metal-poor red giant branch stars, in particular regarding the effective temperature, teff, scale. We revisit the benchmark star HD 122563 using the most recent observations from Gaia Data Release 3, to investigate if these new constraints may help in resolving this discrepancy. We review the most recent spectroscopic determinations of the metallicity of HD 122563 [Fe/H], and provide a new assessment of its fundamental parameters, i.e. bolometric luminosity, teff, surface gravity, plus a photometric determination of its metal content. Using these constraints, we compare the position of the star in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram with various recent sets of stellar evolution tracks. The H-R diagram analysis reveals a significant disagreement between observed and theoretical teff values, when adopting the most recent spectroscopic estimate of [Fe/H]. On the other hand, by using the photometric determination of [Fe/H] some of the selected sets of stellar tracks appear in fair agreement with observations. The sets with discrepant teff can be made to agree with observations either by modifying the prescription adopted to calculate the models' outer boundary conditions, and/or by reducing the adopted value of the mixing length parameter with respect to the solar-calibration. A definitive assessment of whether the teff scale of metal-poor stellar red giant branch models is consistent with observations requires an even more accurate determination of the fundamental parameters of HD 122563 and also a larger sample of calibrators. From the theoretical side, it is crucial to minimise the current uncertainties in the treatment (boundary conditions, temperature gradient) of the outer layers of stellar models with convective envelopes.

 - **Abstract**
 Life as we know it requires the presence of liquid water and the availability of nutrients, which are mainly based on the elements C, H, N, O, P, and S (CHNOPS) and trace metal micronutrients. We aim to understand the presence of these nutrients within atmospheres that show the presence of water cloud condensates, potentially allowing the existence of aerial biospheres. In this paper we introduce a framework of nutrient availability levels based on the presence of water condensates and the chemical state of the CHNOPS elements. These nutrient availability levels are applied to a set of atmospheric models based on different planetary surface compositions resulting in a range of atmospheric compositions. The atmospheric model is a bottom-to-top equilibrium chemistry atmospheric model which includes the atmosphere-crust interaction and the element depletion due to the formation of clouds. While the reduced forms of CNS are present at the water cloud base for most atmospheric compositions, P and metals are lacking. This indicates the potential bio-availability of CNS, while P and metals are limiting factors for aerial biospheres.

 We performed correlation analyses between the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO $J=$1-0 line intensities in order to derive the variability of the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($X_{\rm CO, iso}$) in the central molecular zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy. New high-resolution $X_{\rm CO, iso}$ maps at a resolution of $\sim 30$" and the longitude-velocity diagram (LVD) at resolution $\sim 30$" $ \times\ 2$ km s$^{-1}$ are presented using the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO archival survey data obtained by the Nobeyama 45 m telescope. We revealed the variation of $X_{\rm CO, iso}$ in the CMZ within the range of $X_{\rm CO, iso} \sim (0.2-1.3) \times 10^{20}\ {\rm cm^{-2}\ (K\ km\ s^{-1})^{-1}}$, if we assume the normalization value of $0.59 \times 10^{20}\ {\rm cm^{-2}\ (K\ km\ s^{-1})^{-1}}$. The mean value is obtained as $X_{\rm CO, iso} = (0.48 \pm 0.15) \times 10^{20}\ {\rm cm^{-2}\ (K\ km\ s^{-1})^{-1}}$ in the CMZ of our Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Near-Earth objects (NEOs) on an impact course with Earth can move at high angular speed. Understanding their properties, including rotation state, is crucial for assessing impact risks and mitigation strategies. Traditional photometric methods face challenges in collecting data on fast-moving NEOs accurately. Aims. This study introduces an innovative approach to aperture photometry tailored to analyzing trailed images of fast-moving NEOs. Our primary aim is to extract rotation state information from these observations, particularly focusing on the efficacy of this technique for fast rotators. Methods. We applied our approach to analyze the trailed images of three asteroids: 2023 CX1, 2024 BX1, and 2024 EF, which were either on a collision courses or performing a close fly-by with Earth. By adjusting aperture sizes, we controlled the effective exposure times to increase the sampling rates of the photometric variations. This enabled us to detect short rotation periods that would be challenging with conventional methods. Results. Our analysis revealed that trailed photometry significantly reduces overhead time associated with CCD read-out, enhancing the sampling rate of the photometric variations. We demonstrated that this technique is particularly effective for fast-moving objects, providing reliable photometric data when the object is at its brightest and closest to Earth. For asteroid 2024 BX1, we detected a rotation period as short as 2.5888 +- 0.0002 seconds, the fastest ever recorded. Our findings underscore the efficacy of trailed observations coupled with aperture photometry for studying the rotation characteristics of small NEOs, offering crucial insights for impact risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
#### Quadratic Rastall Gravity: from low-mass HESS J1731-347 to high-mass PSR  J0952-0607 pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 Similar to Rastall gravity we introduce matter-geometry nonminimal coupling which is proportional to the gradient of quadratic curvature invariants. Those are mimicking the conformal trace anomaly when backreaction of the quantum fields to a curved spacetime geometry is considered. We consider a static spherically symmetric stellar structure with anisotropic fluid and Krori-Barua metric potentials model to examine the theory. Confronting the model with NICER+XMM-Newton observational constraints on the pulsar PSR J0740$+$6620 quantifies the amount of the nonminimal coupling via a dimensionless parameter $\epsilon\simeq -0.01$. We verify that the conformal symmetry is broken everywhere inside the pulsar as the trace anomaly $\Delta>0$, or equivalently the trace of the stress-energy tensor $\mathfrak{T}<0$, whereas the adiabatic sound speed does not violate the conjecture conformal upper limit $v_r^2/c^2 = 1/3$. The maximum compactness accordingly is $C_\text{max}=0.752$ which is $4\%$ higher than GR. Notably, if the conformal sound speed constraint is hold, observational data excludes $\epsilon \geq 0$ up to $\geq 1.6\sigma$. The stellar model is consistent with the self-bound structure with soft linear equation of state. Investigating possible connection with MIT bag model of strange quarks sets physical bounds from microscopic physics which confirm the negative value of the parameter $\epsilon$. We estimate a radius $R=13.21 \pm 0.96$ km of the most massive observed compact star PSR J0952$-$0607 with $M=2.35\pm0.17 M_\odot$. Finally, we show that the corresponding mass-radius diagram fits well lowest-mass pulsar HESS J1731$-$347 and highest-mass pulsar PSR J0952$-$0607 ever observed as well as the intermediate mass range as obtained by NICER and LIGO/Virgo observations.

 Aims. To comprehend the efficiency of dust evolution within protoplanetary disks, it is crucial to conduct studies of these disks using high-resolution observations at multiple wavelengths with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Methods. In this work, we present high-frequency ALMA observations of the HL Tau disk using its Band 9 centered at a wavelength of 0.45 mm. These observations achieve the highest angular resolution in a protoplanetary disk to date, 12 milliarcseconds (mas), allowing the study of the dust emission at scales of 2 au. We use these data to extend the previously published multi-wavelength analysis of the HL Tau disk. Results. Our new 0.45 mm data traces mainly optically thick emission, providing a tight constraint to the dust temperature profile. We derive maximum particle sizes of $\sim$1 cm from the inner disk to $\sim$60 au. Beyond this radius, we find particles between 300 $\mu$m and 1 mm. Moreover, an intriguing asymmetry is observed at 32 au in the northeast inner part of the HL Tau disk at 0.45 mm. We propose that this asymmetry is the outcome of a combination of factors including the optically thick nature of the emission, the orientation of the disk, and a relatively large dust scale height of the grains. To validate this, we conducted a series of radiative transfer models using the RADMC-3D software. If this scenario is correct, our measured dust mass within 32 au would suggest a dust scale height H/R> 0.08 for the inner disk. Finally, the unprecedented resolution allowed us to probe for the first time the dust emission down to a few au scales. We observed an increase in brightness temperature inside the estimated water snowline and speculate whether it could indicate the presence of a traffic jam effect in the inner disk. Abridge
#### Early evolution of spin direction in dark matter halos and the effect of  the surrounding large-scale tidal field

 - **Abstract**
 It is usually assumed that the angular momentum (AM) of dark matter halos arises during the linear stages of structure formation, as a consequence of the coupling between the proto-haloes' shape and the tidal field produced by their surrounding density perturbations. This approach, known as linear tidal torque theory (TTT), has been shown to make fairly good predictions about the mean evolution of both the AM amplitude and orientation up to approximately the time when the proto-haloes collapse. After this point, proto-haloes are increasingly affected by non-linear processes that are not taken into account by the model. However, it has been seen in numerical simulations that, even at very early stages, the AM of proto-haloes is systematically reoriented towards perpendicularity with respect to the forming cosmic filaments, in contradiction with the fixed direction expected from the TTT. In this work we present a novel analytical approach that introduces an anisotropic scaling factor to the standard TTT equations, which allows the AM orientation to change in time, even during the linear regime. The amplitude and direction of this shift depend on the large scale tidal field around the forming proto-haloes. Our results significantly improve the predictions for the AM direction up to the time of protohalo collapse and, in some cases, even further in time.
#### Bounds on galaxy stochasticity from halo occupation distribution  modeling

 - **Abstract**
 The joint probability distribution of matter overdensity and galaxy counts in cells is a powerful probe of cosmology, and the extent to which variance in galaxy counts at fixed matter density deviates from Poisson shot noise is not fully understood. The lack of informed bounds on this stochasticity is currently the limiting factor in constraining cosmology with the galaxy-matter PDF. We investigate stochasticity in the conditional distribution of galaxy counts at fixed matter density and present a halo occupation distribution (HOD)-based approach for obtaining plausible ranges for stochasticity parameters. To probe the high-dimensional space of possible galaxy-matter connections, we derive HODs which conserve linear galaxy bias and number density to produce redMaGiC-like galaxy catalogs within the AbacusSummit suite of N-body simulations. We study the impact of individual HOD parameters and cosmology on stochasticity and perform a Monte Carlo search in HOD parameter space, subject to the constraints on bias and density. In mock catalogs generated by the selected HODs, shot noise in galaxy counts spans both sub-Poisson and super-Poisson values, ranging from 80% to 133% of Poisson variance at mean matter density. Nearly all derived HODs show a positive relationship between local matter density and stochasticity. For galaxy catalogs with higher stochasticity, quadratic galaxy bias is required for an accurate description of the conditional PDF of galaxy counts at fixed matter density. The presence of galaxy assembly bias also substantially extends the range of stochasticity in the super-Poisson direction. This HOD-based approach leverages degrees of freedom in the galaxy-halo connection to obtain informed bounds on model nuisance parameters and can be adapted to other parametrizations of stochasticity, in particular to motivate prior ranges for cosmological analyses.
