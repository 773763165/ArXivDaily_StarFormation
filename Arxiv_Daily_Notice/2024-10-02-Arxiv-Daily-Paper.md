 - **Abstract**
 This work investigates a hybrid photovoltaic-wind-battery power system designed to sustain a Mars base under varying seasonal and climatic conditions. The Mars Climate Database was utilized to simulate the effects of seasonal changes, diurnal cycles, and dust storms on the system's power generation. The seasonal performance was analyzed across the Martian surface and at potential habitation sites proposed in the "First Landing Site/Exploration Zone Workshop for Human Missions to the Surface of Mars (FLSW).'' Within the hybrid system, the photovoltaic arrays serve as the primary energy source, with wind turbines providing essential backup during nighttime and dust storms. A single $1\,000\,\mathrm{m}^2$ photovoltaic array, a $33.4\,\mathrm{m}$ diameter wind turbine, and a $312\,\mathrm{kWh}$ battery can support a six-person Mars base at $32.1\%$ of the Martian surface during the equinoxes and solstices, expanding to $51.7\%$ with three sets of arrays and turbines. Additionally, $24$ FLSW sites can be supported throughout the solstices and equinoxes by a single photovoltaic array, turbine, and battery, even during global dust storms. Among the $24$ sites, Hebrus Valles, Huygens Crater, and Noctis Labyrinthus had the highest energy production potential. These findings are expected to guide further research on hybrid renewable power systems for Mars exploration.

 - **Abstract**
 The sky-averaged brightness temperature of the 21cm line from neutral hydrogen provides a sensitive probe of the thermal state of the intergalactic medium, particularly before and during Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionisation. This `global signal' is faint, on the order of tens to hundreds of millikelvin, and spectrally relatively smooth, making it exceedingly difficult to disentangle from foreground radio emission and instrumental artefacts. In this paper, we introduce RHINO, an experiment based around a large horn antenna operating from 60-85 MHz. Horn antennas are highly characterisable and provide excellent shielding from their immediate environment, which are potentially decisive advantages when it comes to the beam measurement and modelling problems that are particularly challenging for this kind of experiment. The system also includes a novel continuous wave calibration source to control correlated gain fluctuations, allowing continuous monitoring of the overall gain level without needing to rapidly switch between the sky and a calibration source. Here, we describe the basic RHINO concept, including the antenna design, EM simulations, and receiver electronics. We use a basic simulation and analysis pipeline to study the impact of the limited bandwidth on recovery of physical 21cm global signal model parameters, and discuss a basic calibration scheme that incorporates the continuous wave signal. Finally, we report on the current state of a scaled-down prototype system under construction at Jodrell Bank Observatory.

          Massive neutrinos and cosmic composition

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological data probe massive neutrinos via their effects on the geometry of the Universe and the growth of structure, both of which are degenerate with the late-time expansion history. We clarify the nature of these degeneracies and the individual roles of both probes in neutrino mass inference. Geometry is strongly sensitive to neutrino masses: within $\Lambda$CDM, the primary cosmic microwave background anisotropies alone impose that the matter fraction $\Omega_m$ must increase fivefold with increasing neutrino mass. Moreover, large-scale structure observables, like weak lensing of the CMB, are dimensionless and thus depend not on the matter density (as often quoted) but in fact the matter fraction. We explore the consequential impact of this distinction on the interplay between probes of structure, low-redshift distances, and CMB anisotropies. We derive constraints on the neutrino's masses independently from their suppression of structure and impact on geometry, showing that the latter is at least as important as the former. While the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument's recent baryon acoustic oscillation data place stringent bounds largely deriving from their geometric incompatibility with massive neutrinos, all recent type Ia supernova datasets drive marginal preferences for nonzero neutrino masses because they prefer substantially larger matter fractions. Recent CMB lensing data, however, neither exclude neutrinos' suppression of structure nor constrain it strongly enough to discriminate between mass hierarchies. Current data thus evince not a need for modified dynamics of neutrino perturbations or structure growth but rather an inconsistent compatibility with massive neutrinos' impact on the expansion history. We identify two of DESI's measurements that strongly influence its constraints, and we also discuss neutrino mass measurements in models that alter the sound horizon.

          Improving Precision in Kinematic Weak Lensing with MIRoRS: Model-Independent Restoration of Reflection Symmetries

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel, model-independent technique for fitting the cross-component of weak lensing shear, $\gamma_\times$, along a line of sight by combining kinematic and photometric measurements of a single lensed galaxy. Rather than relying on parametric models, we fit for the shear parameter that best transforms the velocity field to restore its underlying symmetries, while also incorporating photometric data for the change in position angle due to shear. We first validate our technique with idealized mock data, exploring the method's response to variations in shear, position angle, inclination, and noise. On this idealized mock data, our combined kinematic and photometric model demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional parametric or kinematic-only approaches. Subsequently, we apply our method to a dataset of 358 halos from the Illustris TNG simulations, achieving a notable reduction in the uncertainty of $\gamma_\times$ to 0.039, marking a substantial improvement over previous analysis of the dataset with a parametric model. Finally, we introduce an outlier rejection method based on Moran's I-test for spatial autocorrelation. Identifying and filtering out halos with spatially correlated residuals reduces the overall uncertainty to 0.028. Our results underscore the efficacy of combining kinematic and photometric data for weak lensing studies, providing a more precise and targeted measurement of shear along an individual line of sight.

 - **Abstract**
 In the third APOKASC catalog, we present data for the complete sample of 15,808 evolved stars with APOGEE spectroscopic parameters and Kepler asteroseismology. We used ten independent asteroseismic analysis techniques and anchor our system on fundamental radii derived from Gaia $L$ and spectroscopic $T_{\rm eff}$. We provide evolutionary state, asteroseismic surface gravity, mass, radius, age, and the spectroscopic and asteroseismic measurements used to derive them for 12,418 stars. This includes 10,036 exceptionally precise measurements, with median fractional uncertainties in \nmax, \dnu, mass, radius and age of 0.6\%, 0.6\%, 3.8\%, 1.8\%, and 11.1\% respectively. We provide more limited data for 1,624 additional stars which either have lower quality data or are outside of our primary calibration domain. Using lower red giant branch (RGB) stars, we find a median age for the chemical thick disk of $9.14 \pm 0.05 ({\rm ran}) \pm 0.9 ({\rm sys})$ Gyr with an age dispersion of 1.1 Gyr, consistent with our error model. We calibrate our red clump (RC) mass loss to derive an age consistent with the lower RGB and provide asymptotic GB and RGB ages for luminous stars. We also find a sharp upper age boundary in the chemical thin disk. We find that scaling relations are precise and accurate on the lower RGB and RC, but they become more model dependent for more luminous giants and break down at the tip of the RGB. We recommend the usage of multiple methods, calibration to a fundamental scale, and the usage of stellar models to interpret frequency spacings.

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST/MIRI observations of T~Cha, a highly variable ($\Delta V \sim$3-5\,mag) accreting Sun-like star surrounded by a disk with a large ($\sim 15$\,au) dust gap. We find that the JWST mid-infrared spectrum is signiticantly different from the {\it Spitzer} spectrum obtained 17 years before, where the emission at short wavelengths ($5-10 \mu m$) has decreased by $\sim 2/3$ while at longer wavelengths ($15-25 \mu m$) it increased by up to a factor of $\sim 3$. This 'seesaw' behavior is contemporary with a fairly constant higher optical emission captured by the All Sky Automated Survey. By analyzing and modelling both SEDs, we propose that JWST caught the star during an outburst that destructed the asymmetric inner disk wall responsible for the high optical variability and lower $15-25$\,micron\ emission during the {\it Spitzer} time. The dust mass lost during this outburst is estimated to be comparable ($\sim 1/5$) to the upper limit of the total micron-sized dust mass in the inner disk of T~Cha now. Monitoring this system during possible future outbursts and more observations of its quiescent state will reveal if the inner disk can be replenished or will continue to be depleted and vanish.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how the quasi-universal relations connecting tidal deformability with gravitational waveform characteristics and/or properties of individual neutron stars that were proposed in the literature within general relativity would be influenced in the massive Damour-Esposito-Farese-type scalar-tensor gravity. For this purpose, we systematically perform numerical relativity simulations of ~120 binary neutron star mergers with varying scalar coupling constants. Although only three neutron-star equations of state are adopted, a clear breach of universality can be observed in the data sets. In addition to presenting difficulties in constructing quasi-universal relations in alternative gravity theories, we also briefly compare the impacts of non-general-relativity physics on the waveform features and those due to the first order or cross-over quantum chromodynamical phase transition.

 - **Abstract**
 It is possible for asymmetric dark matter (ADM) to accumulate in neutron star interiors and affect their global properties. Considering the effects of this accumulation, neutron star mass-radius measurements can deliver new insights into the cold dense matter equation of state (EoS). In this paper, we employ Bayesian parameter estimation using real and synthetic neutron star mass-radius data to infer constraints on the combined baryonic matter and fermionic ADM EoS, where the fermionic ADM forms a core in the neutron star interior. Using currently available mass-radius data, we find that the lower bound of the ratio between ADM effective self-repulsion strength ($g_\chi/m_\phi$) and particle mass ($m_\chi$) can be constrained at the 68% (95%) credible level to $10^{-6.59}$ ($10^{-7.36}$). We also find that, if neutron star mass-radius measurement uncertainties are reduced to the 2% level, the constraints on lower bound on the ratio of $g_\chi/m_\phi$ to $m_\chi$ can be improved to $10^{-6.5}$ and $10^{-7.29}$ at the 68% and 95% credible levels, respectively. However, all other combinations, of $m_\chi$, $g_\chi$, and the ADM mass-fraction, $F_\chi$, (i.e., the ratio of the gravitational ADM mass to the gravitational mass of the neutron star) are unconstrained. Furthermore, in the pressure-energy density and mass-radius planes, the inferences which include the possibility of fermionic ADM cores are nearly identical with the inferences that neglect fermionic ADM for $F_\chi \leq 1.7\%$ and neutron star mass-radius uncertainties $\geq 2\%$. Therefore, we find that neutron star mass-radius measurements can constrain ADM in some scenarios and that the presence of ADM in neutron star cores is as equally consistent with current data as the absence of ADM.

          JWST imaging of edge-on protoplanetary disks. III. Drastic morphological transformation across the mid-infrared in Oph163131

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST broadband images of the highly inclined protoplanetary disk SSTc2d J163131.2-242627 (Oph163131) from 2.0 to 21$\mu$m. The images show a remarkable evolution in disk structure with wavelength, quite different from previous JWST observations of other edge-on disks. At 2.0 and 4.4$\mu$m, Oph163131 shows two scattering surfaces separated by a dark lane, typical of highly inclined disks. Starting at 7.7$\mu$m however, 1) the two linear nebulosities flanking the dark lane disappear; 2) the brighter nebula tracing the disk upper surface transitions into a compact central source distinctly larger than the JWST PSF and whose intrinsic size increases with wavelength; and 3) patches of extended emission appear at low latitudes, and at surprisingly large radii nearly twice that of the scattered light seen with $HST$ and NIRCam, and of the gas. We interpret the compact central source as thermal emission from the star and the inner disk that is not seen directly, but which instead is able to progressively propagate to greater distances at longer wavelengths. The lack of sharp-edged structures in the extended patchy emission argues against the presence of shocks and suggests photoexcitation or stochastic heating of material smoothly flowing away from the star along the disk surface. Finally, the dark lane thickness decreases significantly between 0.6$\mu$m and 4.4$\mu$m which indicates that the surface layers of Oph163131 lack grains larger than 1$\mu$m.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the number of apocenter passages $p$ and the radial action $J_r$ of each particle, we characterize the phase-space structure within the multi-stream regions of cold and warm dark matter halos in cosmological $N$-body simulations. Building on previous work by Enomoto et al. (2024), we analyze the radial density profiles of particles classified by $p$ and $J_r$. We find that the profiles consistently follow a double power-law structure, independent of the dark matter model or halo mass. The inner profile exhibits a $\rho \propto r^{-1}$ behavior, which is consistent with previous studies. Notably, this characteristics persist across both classification schemes. In contrast, the outer power-law profiles display distinct behaviors depending on the classification. While particles classified by $p$ exhibit a steeper slope, ranging from $-6$ to $-8$, those classified by $J_r$ follow a common slope of approximately $-3.5$. Overall, the amplitude of the double power-law profiles varies between simulations for different dark matter models, but this variation can be attributed to statistical differences in the concentration of halos across the models.

 - **Abstract**
 Hundreds of exoplanets between 1-1.8 times the size of the Earth have been discovered on close in orbits. However, these planets show such a diversity in densities that some appear to be made entirely of iron, while others appear to host gaseous envelopes. To test this diversity in composition, we update the masses of 5 rocky exoplanets (HD 93963 A b, Kepler-10 b, Kepler-100 b, Kepler-407 b, and TOI-1444 b) and present the confirmation of a new planet (TOI-1011) using 187 high precision RVs from Gemini/MAROON-X and Keck/KPF. Our updated planet masses suggest compositions closer to that of the Earth than previous literature values for all planets in our sample. In particular, we report that two previously identified ``super-Mercuries'' (Kepler-100 b and HD 93963 A b) have lower masses that suggest less iron-rich compositions. We then compare the ratio of iron to rock-building species to the abundance ratios of those elements in their host stars. These updated planet compositions do not suggest a steep relationship between planet and host star compositions, contradictory to previous results, and suggest that planets and host stars have similar abundance ratios.

 - **Abstract**
 The prompt spectra of gamma-ray bursts are known to follow broadband continuum behavior over decades in energy. GRB 221009A, given the moniker the brightest of all time (BOAT), is the brightest gamma-ray burst identified in half a century of observations, and was first identified by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). On behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team, Lesage et al. (2023) described the initial GBM analysis. Ravasio et al. (2024) report the identification of a spectral line in part of the prompt emission of this burst, which they describe as evolving over 80 s from $\sim$12 MeV to 6 MeV. We report a GBM Team analysis on the Ravasio Line: 1) We cannot identify an instrumental effect that could have produced this signal, and 2) our method of calculating the statistical significance of the line shows it easily exceeds the 5$\sigma$ discovery threshold. We additionally comment on the claim of the line beginning at earlier time intervals, up to 37 MeV, as reported in Zhang et al. (2024). We find that it is reasonable to utilize these measurements for characterization of the line evolution, with caution. We encourage theoretical studies exploring this newly discovered gamma-ray burst spectral feature, unless any rigorous alternative explanation unrelated to the emission from GRB 221009A is identified.

 - **Abstract**
 In some recent work, we provided a quantitative explanation for the number asymmetry of Jupiter Trojans by hypothesizing a free-floating planet (FFP) flyby into the Solar System. In support of that explanation, this paper examines the influence of the same FFP flyby on the Hilda asteroids, which orbit stably in the 3:2 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. The observed Hilda population exhibits two distinct resonant patterns: (1) a lack of Hildas with resonant amplitudes < 40 deg. at eccentricities < 0.1; (2) a nearly complete absence of Hildas with amplitudes < 20 deg., regardless of eccentricity. Previous models of Jupiter migration and resonance capture could account for the eccentricity distribution of Hildas but have failed to replicate the unusual absence of those with the smallest resonant amplitudes, which theoretically should be the most stable. Here we report that the FFP flyby can trigger an extremely rapid outward migration of Jupiter, causing a sudden shift in the 3:2 Jovian resonance. Consequently, Hildas with varying eccentricities would have their resonant amplitudes changed by different degrees, leading to the observed resonant patterns. We additionally show that, in our FFP flyby scenario, these patterns are consistently present across different resonant amplitude distributions of primordial Hildas arising from various formation models. We also place constraints on the potential parameters of the FFP, suggesting it should have an eccentricity of 1-1.3 or larger, an inclination up to 30 deg. or higher, and a minimum mass of about 50 Earth masses.

 - **Abstract**
 Our paper introduces a new theory called Fractional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar field cosmology, which has significant implications for Cosmology. We derived a modified Friedmann equation and a modified Klein-Gordon equation using fractional calculus to modify the gravitational action integral. Our research reveals non-trivial solutions associated with exponential potential, exponential couplings to the Gauss-Bonnet term, and logarithmic scalar field, which are dependent on two cosmological parameters, $m$ and $\alpha_{0}=t_{0}H_{0}$ and the fractional derivative order $\mu$. By employing linear stability theory, we reveal the phase space structure and analyze the dynamic effects of the Gauss-Bonnet couplings. The scaling behavior at some equilibrium points reveals that the geometric corrections in the coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet scalar can mimic the behavior of the dark sector in modified gravity. Using data from cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae, supermassive black hole shadows, and strong gravitational lensing, we estimated the values of $m$ and $\alpha_{0}$, indicating that the solution is consistent with an accelerated expansion at late times with the values $\alpha_0=1.38\pm 0.05$, $m=1.44\pm 0.05$, and $\mu=1.491$ (consistent with $\Omega_{m,0}=0.311\pm 0.016$ and $h=0.712\pm 0.007$), resulting in an age of the Universe $t_{0}=19.0\pm 0.7$ [Gyr] at 1$\sigma$ CL. Ultimately, we obtained late-time accelerating power-law solutions supported by the most recent cosmological data, and we proposed an alternative explanation for the origin of cosmic acceleration other than $\Lambda$CDM. Our results generalize and significantly improve previous achievements in the literature, highlighting the practical implications of fractional calculus in Cosmology.

 Following the groundbreaking discovery of the first extrasolar planet orbiting a sun-like star, 51 Pegasi b in 1995, the field of planet formation has become a cornerstone of modern astrophysics. This is in part due to the revelation of an astonishing diversity of planetary types and architectures, inferred from detailed astronomical observations. This diversity is driven by the interplay between the physical processes governing planet assembly and the environmental conditions within the protoplanetary disk in which they form. This chapter provides an introduction to the specific mechanisms that can induce orbital variations in nascent planetary bodies during their formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray observations of shock-heated plasmas, such as those found in supernova remnants, often exhibit features of temperature and ionization non-equilibrium. For accurate interpretation of these observations, proper calculations of the equilibration processes are essential. Here, we present a self-consistent model of thermal X-ray emission from shock-heated plasmas that accounts for both temperature and ionization non-equilibrium conditions. For a given pair of shock velocity and initial electron-to-ion temperature ratio, the temporal evolution of the temperature and ionization state of each element was calculated by simultaneously solving the relaxation processes of temperature and ionization. The resulting thermal X-ray spectrum was synthesized by combining our model with the AtomDB spectral code. Comparison between our model and the \texttt{nei} model, a constant-temperature non-equilibrium ionization model available in the XSPEC software package, reveals a 30\% underestimation of the ionization timescale in the \texttt{nei} model. We implemented our model in XSPEC to directly constrain the shock wave properties, such as the shock velocity and collisionless electron heating efficiency, from the thermal X-ray emission from postshock plasmas. We applied this model to archival Chandra data of the supernova remnant N132D, providing a constraint on the shock velocity of $\sim 800~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, in agreement with previous optical studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Barnard's star is a primary target within the ESPRESSO guaranteed time observations (GTO) as it is the second closest neighbour to our Sun after the $\alpha$ Centauri stellar system. We present here a large set of 156 ESPRESSO observations of Barnard's star carried out over four years with the goal of exploring periods of shorter than 50 days, thus including the habitable zone (HZ). Our analysis of ESPRESSO data using Gaussian process (GP) to model stellar activity suggests a long-term activity cycle at 3200d and confirms stellar activity due to rotation at 140d as the dominant source of radial velocity (RV) variations. These results are in agreement with findings based on publicly available HARPS, HARPS-N, and CARMENES data. ESPRESSO RVs do not support the existence of the previously reported candidate planet at 233d. After subtracting the GP model, ESPRESSO RVs reveal several short-period candidate planet signals at periods of 3.15d, 4.12d, 2.34d, and 6.74d. We confirm the 3.15d signal as a sub-Earth mass planet, with a semi-amplitude of $55 \pm 7$cm/s, leading to a planet minimum mass $m_p \sin i$ of $0.37 \pm 0.05$Mearth, which is about three times the mass of Mars. ESPRESSO RVs suggest the possible existence of a candidate system with four sub-Earth mass planets in circular orbits with semi-amplitudes from 20 to 47cm/s, thus corresponding to minimum masses in the range of 0.17-0.32Mearth. The sub-Earth mass planet at $3.1533 \pm 0.0006$d is in a close-to circular orbit with a semi-major axis of $0.0229 \pm 0.0003$AU, thus located inwards from the HZ of Barnard's star, with an equilibrium temperature of 400K. Additional ESPRESSO observations would be required to confirm that the other three candidate signals originate from a compact short-period planet system orbiting Barnard's star inwards from its HZ.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio waves from the Universe. Even though more than 50 physical models have been proposed, the origin and physical mechanism of FRB emissions are still unknown. The classification of FRBs is one of the primary approaches to understanding their mechanisms, but previous studies classified conventionally using only a few observational parameters, such as fluence and duration, which might be incomplete. To overcome this problem, we use an unsupervised machine-learning model, the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to handle seven parameters simultaneously, including amplitude, linear temporal drift, time duration, central frequency, bandwidth, scaled energy, and fluence. We test the method for homogeneous 977 sub-bursts of FRB 20121102A detected by the Arecibo telescope. Our machine-learning analysis identified five distinct clusters, suggesting the possible existence of multiple different physical mechanisms responsible for the observed FRBs from the FRB 20121102A source. The geometry of the emission region and the propagation effect of FRB signals could also make such distinct clusters. This research will be a benchmark for future FRB classifications when dedicated radio telescopes such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) or Bustling Universe Radio Survey Telescope in Taiwan (BURSTT) discover more FRBs than before.

 - **Abstract**
 A sub-Earth-mass planet orbiting Barnard's star, designated as Barnard b, has been recently announced. At a similar time, the first photometric data of Barnard's star by the Transit Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) was released in Sector 80. We explore the possibility of emergent transits of Barnard b in TESS photometry. The detrended 2 min light curve appears to be flat, with a flux root-mean-square of 0.411 parts per thousand. Attempts of blind and informed transit-curve model inference suggest no evidence of transiting Barnard b, or any other body. This provides a 3$\sigma$ upper bound of 87.9 degrees for the orbital inclination of Barnard b.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsating stars in eclipsing binaries (EBs) provide an excellent opportunity to obtain precise, model-independent stellar parameters for studying oscillations in detail. One common class of pulsators in these EBs exhibits delta Scuti-type oscillations. Characterising these pulsators using the precise parameters obtained from EB modelling enhances our understanding of such stars and strengthens asteroseismic studies. We conducted a comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic analysis of candidate pulsators in detached EBs to expand the sample of systems with accurately determined absolute parameters. We performed radial velocity and light curve modelling to estimate the absolute stellar parameters, along with detailed spectroscopic modelling to obtain global metallicity and temperatures. Frequency power spectra were derived from the residuals of binary modelling. Isochrones were used to determine the stars' ages, which were then compared to theoretically obtained values. We present a detailed analysis of four candidate delta Scuti-type pulsators in EBs and update the light curve analysis of the previously studied system TIC 308953703. The masses and radii of the components are constrained with high accuracy, aiding in age estimation. We perform a Fourier analysis of the observed oscillations and explore their origin. For TIC 81702112, we report tidal effects causing amplitude variation in the oscillation frequencies over the orbital phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated Tsallis holographic dark energy (THDE) model in light of modern observations of supernovae, Hubble parameter measurements, data for baryon acoustic oscillations and fluctuations of matter density. The dark energy density for THDE model is written as $\rho_d = 3C^2 / L^{4-2\gamma}$ where $C$ and $\gamma$ are some constants. Scale $L$ is infrared cut-off lenght for which we use the event horizon. For analysis of type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) data Pantheon+ samples are involved. Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 measurements serves as source of data about ratios between sound horizon $r_d$ and Hubble ($d_H$) or volume averaged ($d_V$) distances. The updated dataset of Hubble parameter for various redshift is also used in our analysis. Finally we considered the dependence of matter density fluctuations in past from redshift. The standard stratefy of $\chi^2$ minimizing allows to estimate the optimal values of parameters ($\Omega_{de}$ and $H_0$) for some fixed values of $C$ and $\gamma$. One note that best-fit values for parameters $H_0$ from Hubble parameter and SNeIa data are more close than in standard $\Lambda$CDM model for some $C$ and $\gamma$ although problem of Hubble tension remains unsolved. The combined data analysis also gives slightly better results in comparison with standard cosmology. We included in our consideration the possible interaction between matter and holographic component and estimated the acceptable interval of model parameters in this case.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations by Planck indicate that CMB anisotropies are consistent with predictions of nearly Gaussian primordial perturbations as the one generated in slow-roll inflation. On the other hand, loop quantum cosmology (LQC) generates a non-Gaussian bispectrum. In particular, calculations of primordial bispectrum generated in LQC shows that the non-Gaussianity function $f_{_{\rm NL}}(k_1,\, k_2,\, k_3)$ is highly scale-dependent and oscillatory at long wavelengths and is nearly scale-invariant as in slow-roll at small scales. We discuss the viability of such a non-Gaussian bispectrum in the light of observations by Planck. More specifically, we model the bispectrum generated in LQC and compute its imprints on the CMB bispectrum. We then show that the CMB bispectrum generated in LQC though non-Gaussian, due to its highly oscillatory nature, is similar to that generated in slow-roll inflation and hence consistent with the observations by Planck.

 - **Abstract**
 The nearby SN 1987A offers a unique opportunity to investigate the complex shock interaction between the ejecta and circumstellar medium. We track the evolution of the optical hotspots within the Equatorial Ring (ER) by analyzing 33 Hubble Space Telescope imaging observations between 1994 and 2022. By fitting the ER with an elliptical model, we determine its inclination to be $ 42.85 \pm 0.50^{\circ}$ with its major axis oriented $ -6.24 \pm 0.31^{\circ}$ from the west. We identify 26 distinct hotspots across the ER, with additional ones emerging over time, particularly on the west side. The hotspots initially show high velocities ranging from $390$ to $1660 \ \rm km \ s^{-1}$, followed by a deceleration phase around day $\sim 8000$. Subsequent velocities vary from $40$ to $660 \ \rm km \ s^{-1}$. The light curves of the hotspots reach maxima between 7000 and 9000 days, suggesting a connection with the deceleration. Many spots are spatially resolved and show elongation perpendicular to the direction of motion, indicative of a short cooling time. To explain these results, we propose that each hotspot comprises dense substructures embedded in less dense gas. The initial velocities are then phase velocities, the break occurs when the blast wave leaves the ER, while the late velocities reflect the propagation of radiative shocks in the dense substructures. We estimate that the dense substructures have a volumetric filling factor of $\sim0.3 \left( n_{\mathrm{e}}/10^{6}\ \mathrm{cm^{-3}} \right)^{-2} \%$ and a total mass of $\sim0.24 \left(n_{\mathrm{e}}/10^{6}\ \mathrm{cm^{-3}} \right)^{-1}\times10^{-2}\ \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We have been developing an x-ray imaging system, Multi-Image X-ray Interferometer Module (MIXIM), to achieve a high angular resolution with a compact system size. MIXIM is comprised of a mask with equally-spaced apertures and an x-ray detector. The aperture size and mask-detector distance determine the system's angular resolution. Although a smaller aperture gives a better resolution, the degree of improvement is limited by a diffraction effect. MIXIM circumvents this problem by utilizing the Talbot effect. Our experiment with the previous model equipped with a multi-pinhole mask obtained an angular resolution of 0.5" with a mask-detector distance of 92 cm. A major downside of the multi-pinhole mask is, however, that it has a very low opening fraction, which results in a very low effective area. Here, we newly adopt to MIXIM a multiple coded aperture (MCA) mask, an array of coded aperture patterns. Our proof-of-concept experiment demonstrates that the Talbot effect works even for the MCA mask with a high opening fraction of ~50% at 12.4 keV. Consequently, the new MIXIM realizes about 25 times as large an effective area as that of the previous model, while maintaining a high angular resolution of 0.2" and a compact size of ~1.5 m.

 - **Abstract**
 The super-puff HIP-41378 f represents a fascinating puzzle due to its anomalously low density on a far-out orbit in contrast with other known super-puffs. In this work, we explore the hypothesis that HIP-41378 f is not in fact a low-density planet, but rather hosts an opaque ring system. We analyze the dynamical history of the system, and show that convergent migration is necessary to explain the system's long-term stability. We then show that this same migration process plausibly captures HIP-41378 f into spin-orbit resonance and excites the planetary obliquity to high values. This tilts the surrounding ring and is a plausible explanation for the large transit depth. In the end, we also briefly comment on the likelihood of other super-puff planets being in high-obliquity states. We show that the existence of a tilted extensive ring around a high obliquity planet can serve as an explanation for puffy planets, particularly in multi-planetary systems at far distances from their host stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are thought to be the most abundant class of molecules in space, yet their interstellar lifecycle is poorly understood due to difficulties detecting individual PAHs. Here, we present the discovery of 1-cyanopyrene, a 4-ring PAH, in the dense cloud TMC-1 using the 100-m Green Bank Telescope. We derive an abundance of ~1.52 x 10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, estimating that pyrene accounts for up to 0.03-0.3% of the carbon in TMC-1 and up to 1% within comets. Our findings agree with analysis of pyrene from asteroid Ryugu, which suggests a cold, interstellar origin. The abundance indicates pyrene is an "island of stability" in interstellar PAH chemistry, and suggests that the carbon supplied to planetary systems, carried by PAHs, originates in cold clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the most ubiquitous compounds in the universe, accounting for up to ~25% of all interstellar carbon. Since most unsubstituted PAHs do not possess permanent dipole moments, they are invisible to radio astronomy. Constraining their abundances relies on the detection of polar chemical proxies, such as aromatic nitriles. We report the detection of 2- and 4-cyanopyrene, isomers of the recently detected 1-cyanopyrene. We find that these isomers are present in an abundance ratio of ~2:1:2, which mirrors the number of equivalent sites available for CN addition. We conclude that there is evidence that the cyanopyrene isomers formed by direct CN addition to pyrene under kinetic control in hydrogen-rich gas at 10 K and discuss constraints on the H/CN ratio for PAHs in TMC-1.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational encounters drive globular clusters toward energy equipartition, mass segregation and evaporation altering structural, spatial and kinematic features. We determine the dynamical state of a few globular clusters by means of a multi-mass King-like dynamical model, focusing on the energy equipartition degree and its relation with model parameters. We fit the observed velocity dispersion, as derived from HST proper motion data, as a function of the stellar mass $\sigma(m)$, to estimate the parameter $\Phi_0$, a measure of the gravitational potential well. The same fit is repeated by means of the Bianchini relation, providing the equipartition mass $m_\mathrm{eq}$. The relationship between $\Phi_0$ and $m_\mathrm{eq}$ has been studied and the structural properties, such as concentration $c$, number of core relaxation timescales $N_\mathrm{core}$ and core radius $r_\mathrm{c}$, are discussed. To obtain an independent estimate of $\Phi_0$, we fit observed surface brightness profiles by using the predicted surface density and a mass-luminosity relation from isochrones. The quality of the fits on $\sigma(m)$ obtained by means of our dynamical model is comparable to those obtained with the Bianchini function. Nonetheless, when the Bianchini function is used to fit the projected velocity dispersion, the resulting degree of equipartition is underestimated. On the contrary, our approach provides the equipartition degree at any radial or projected distance by means of $\Phi_0$. As a result, a cluster in a more advanced dynamical state shows a larger $\Phi_0$, as well as larger $N_\mathrm{core}$ and $c$, while $r_\mathrm{c}$ decreases. The estimates of $\Phi_0$ obtained by fitting surface brightness profiles result compatible at $2\sigma$ confidence level with those from internal kinematics, although further investigation of statistical and systematic errors is required.

 - **Abstract**
 Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of low-mass stars undergo strong tidal effects that modify their spin states. These planets are expected to host dense atmospheres that can also play an important role in the spin evolution. On one hand, gravitational tides tend to synchronise the rotation with the orbital mean motion, but on the other hand, thermal atmospheric tides push the rotation away and may lead to asynchronous equilibria. Here, we investigate the complete tidal evolution of Earth-like planets by taking into account the effect of obliquity and eccentric orbits. We adopted an Andrade rheology for the gravitational tides and benchmarked the unknown parameters with the present rotation of Venus. We then applied our model to Earth-like planets, and we show that asynchronous rotation can be expected for planets orbiting stars with masses between 0.4 and 0.9 $M_\odot$ and semi-major axes between 0.2 and 0.7 au. Interestingly, we find that Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of stars with masses $\sim 0.8$ $M_\odot$ may end up with an equilibrium rotation of 24 hours. We additionally find that these planets can also develop high obliquities, which may help sustain temperate environments.

 We present the results obtained from X-ray and optical analysis of the Be/X-ray binary IGR~J06074+2205, focusing on before, during, and after the X-ray outbursts in October and December 2023. The properties of the neutron star in the binary are investigated using NICER and NuSTAR observations during the X-ray outbursts. The pulse profiles across a broad energy range, are found to be strongly dependent on luminosity and energy, revealing the complex nature of the emitting region. An absorbed power-law can describe each NICER spectrum in the 1-7 keV band. The 3-79 keV NuSTAR spectrum can be well-described by a negative and positive power-law with an exponential cut-off model. Utilizing the MAXI/GSC long-term light curve, we estimate the probable orbital period to be 80 or 80/n (n=2,3,4) days. We investigate the evolution of the circumstellar disc around the Be star by using optical spectroscopic observations of the system between 2022 and 2024. We observe variable H$\alpha$ and FeII emission lines with an increase in equivalent width, indicating the presence of a dynamic circumstellar disc. A distinct variation in the V/R value for H$\alpha$ and FeII lines is also observed. The appearance of additional emission lines, such as HeI (5875.72 Å), HeI (6678 Å), and HeI (7065 Å), during the post-outburst observation in February 2024 suggests the growing of a larger or denser circumstellar disc. The disc continues to grow without any noticeable mass loss, even during the 2023 X-ray outbursts, which may lead to a future giant X-ray outburst.

 The updated catalogue of $\delta$ Sct stars in binary systems as well as their statistical properties are presented. Thanks to the Kepler, K2 and TESS space missions, this version of the catalogue contains more than 1000 $\delta$ Sct pulsators in binaries. The sample is divided according to the Roche Geometry of the binary systems in order to check for any systematic differences in the pulsators' evolution due to the proximity of the companion star. Statistics, demographics, and distributions of these pulsating stars within the H-R and mass-radius diagrams are provided. We notice that the absolute parameters have been accurately determined for only approximately 10% of the whole sample. Additionally, updated correlations between pulsation and orbital periods and evolutionary status are presented. This work aims to motivate the researchers for systematic analyses of such objects in order to increase the sample of systems with well known physical properties.

 Thanks to their short orbital periods and hot extended atmospheres, hot Jupiters are ideal candidates for atmosphere studies with high-resolution spectroscopy. New stable spectrographs help improve our understanding of the evolution and composition of those types of planets. By analyzing two nights of observations using the ESPRESSO high-resolution spectrograph, we studied the architecture and atmosphere of hot Jupiter WASP-122b (KELT-14b). By analyzing the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, we measured the spin-orbit angle of the system to be lambda = 0.09 +0.88/-0.90 deg. This result is in line with literature obliquity measurements of planetary systems around stars with effective temperatures cooler than 6500 K. Using the transmission spectroscopy, we studied the atmosphere of the planet. Applying both the single-line analysis and the cross-correlation method, we looked for Ca I, Cr I, FeH, Fe I, Fe II, H2O, Li I, Mg I, Na I, Ti I, TiO, V I, VO, and Y I. Our results show no evidence of any of these species in WASP-122b's atmosphere. The lack of significant detections can be explained by either the RM effect covering the regions where the atmospheric signal is expected and masking it, along with the low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the observations or the absence of the relevant species in its atmosphere.

 We consider constraints on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$ from: (i) the age of the Universe based on old stars and stellar populations in the Galactic disc and halo (Cimatti & Moresco 2023); (ii) the turnover scale in the matter power spectrum, which tells us the cosmological horizon at the epoch of matter-radiation equality (Philcox et al. 2022); and (iii) the shape of the expansion history from supernovae (SNe) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) with no absolute calibration of either, a technique known as uncalibrated cosmic standards (UCS; Lin, Chen, & Mack 2021). A narrow region is consistent with all three constraints just outside their $1\sigma$ uncertainties. Although this region is defined by techniques unrelated to the physics of recombination and the sound horizon then, the standard $Planck$ fit to the CMB anisotropies falls precisely in this region. This concordance argues against early-time explanations for the anomalously high local estimate of $H_0$ (the 'Hubble tension'), which can only be reconciled with the age constraint at an implausibly low $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$. We suggest instead that outflow from the local KBC supervoid (Keenan, Barger, & Cowie 2013) inflates redshifts in the nearby universe and thus the apparent local $H_0$. Given the difficulties with solutions in the early universe, we argue that the most promising alternative to a local void is a modification to the expansion history at late times, perhaps due to a changing dark energy density.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejection (CME) often produces a soft X-ray (SXR) flare associated with the low-coronal reconnection and a type-II radio burst associated with an interplanetary (IP) CME-shock. SXR flares and type-II bursts outshine the background emission, making them sun-as-a-star observables. Though there exist SXR flare catalogs covering decades of observations, they do not provide the associated type-II luminosity. Besides, since radio burst emission could be beamed, the observed flux dynamic spectrum may vary with line of sight. Using long-term calibrated decameter-hectometric dynamic spectra from the Wind and STEREO spacecraft, we build a catalog of multi-vantage point observations of type-II bursts. Cross-matching with existing catalogs we compile the properties of the associated flare, reconnection, and the CME. Cross-correlation analysis was done between various parameters. Two novel metrics of flare and CME power show a strong correlation revealing a link between particle acceleration strengths in the low-corona and IP space.

 - **Abstract**
 Future far-infrared (IR) observatories require compact and cost efficient optical linear variable bandpass filters (LVBFs) to define their instrument spectral bands. We have designed novel far-IR LVBFs that consist of metal-mesh bandpass filters comprised of a gold film with cross-slots of varying sizes along a silicon (Si) substrate with anti-reflection (AR) coatings. We present our work on the simulated and measured transmission of non-AR coated and AR coated LVBFs for bandpass peaks from wavelengths of 24 to 36 $\mu$m with a resolving power ($R=\lambda_0/\Delta\lambda$) of R$\approx$6 for non-AR coated LVBFs and R$\approx$4 for AR coated LVBFs. We also present a method to decrease the effects of out-of-band high frequency transmission exhibited by metal-mesh filters by depositing a thin layer of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) on the metal-mesh of the LVBF. We have fabricated and measured the LVBFs at room temperature and cryogenic temperatures (5 K). We measure a high peak transmission of $\sim$80-90 \% for the AR coated LVBF at 5 K and demonstrate that the a-Si:H LVBF is a promising method to address out-of-band high frequency transmission.

          DESI constraints on $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models

 - **Abstract**
 The recent results on the baryon acoustic oscillations measurements from the DESI collaboration have shown tantalizing hints for a time-evolving dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$, with a statistically significant deviation from the cosmological constant and cold dark matter (\lcdm) model. One of the simplest and theoretically well-motivated plausible candidates to explain the observed behavior of $w(z)$, is scalar-field quintessence. Here, we consider a class of models known as $\alpha$-attractor, which describe in a single framework both inflation and the late-time acceleration of the Universe. Using the recent DESI data, in conjunction with other cosmological observations, we place stringent constraints on $\alpha$-attractor models and compare them to the \lcdm\, model. We find the $\alpha$ parameter of the theory, which is physically motivated from supergravity and supersymmentry theories to have the values $3\alpha \in \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}$, is constrained to be $\alpha\simeq 1.89_{-0.35}^{+0.40}$. In addition, we find that the rest of the cosmological parameters of the model agree with the corresponding values of \lcdm, while a bayesian analysis finds strong support in favor of the $\alpha$-attractor model. We also highlight an interesting connection between the $\alpha$-attractor models and the stochastic gravitational wave background, where a contribution to the latter could derive from an enhancement of inflationary gravitational waves at high frequencies due to an early kination phase, thus providing an interesting alternative way to constrain the theory in the near future.

 - **Abstract**
 Head-on giant impacts (collisions between planet-size bodies) are frequently used to study the planet formation process as they present an extreme configuration where the two colliding bodies are greatly disturbed. With limited computing resources, focusing on these extreme impacts eases the burden of exploring a large parameter space. Results from head-on impacts are often then extended to study oblique impacts with angle corrections or used as initial conditions for other calculations, for example, the evolution of ejected debris. In this study, we conduct a detailed investigation of the thermodynamic and energy budget evolution of high-energy head-on giant impacts, entering the catastrophic impacts regime, for target masses between 0.001 and 12 M$_{\oplus}$. We demonstrate the complex interplay of gravitational forces, shock dynamics, and thermodynamic processing in head-on impacts at high energy. Our study illustrates that frequent interactions of core material with the liquid side of the vapour curve could have cumulative effects on the post-collision remnants, leading to fragmentary disintegration occurring at lower impact energy. This results in the mass of the largest remnant diverging significantly from previously developed scaling laws. These findings suggest two key considerations: 1) head-on planetary collisions for different target masses do not behave similarly, so caution is needed when applying scaling laws across a broad parameter space; 2) an accurate model of the liquid-vapour phase boundary is essential for modeling giant impacts. Our findings highlight the need for careful consideration of impact configurations in planetary formation studies, as head-on impacts involve a complex interplay between thermodynamic processing, shocks, gravitational forces, and other factors.

          Massive $\nu$s through the CNN lens: interpreting the field-level neutrino mass information in weak lensing

 - **Abstract**
 Modern cosmological surveys probe the Universe deep into the nonlinear regime, where massive neutrinos suppress cosmic structure. Traditional cosmological analyses, which use the 2-point correlation function to extract information, are no longer optimal in the nonlinear regime, and there is thus much interest in extracting beyond-2-point information to improve constraints on neutrino mass. Quantifying and interpreting the beyond-2-point information is thus a pressing task. We study the field-level information in weak lensing convergence maps using convolution neural networks. We find that the network performance increases as higher source redshifts and smaller scales are considered -- investigating up to a source redshift of 2.5 and $\ell_{\rm max}\simeq10^4$ -- verifying that massive neutrinos leave a distinct effect on weak lensing. However, the performance of the network significantly drops after scaling out the 2-point information from the maps, implying that most of the field-level information can be found in the 2-point correlation function alone. We quantify these findings in terms of the likelihood ratio and also use Integrated Gradient saliency maps to interpret which parts of the map the network is learning the most from, finding that the network extracts information from the most overdense and underdense regions.
