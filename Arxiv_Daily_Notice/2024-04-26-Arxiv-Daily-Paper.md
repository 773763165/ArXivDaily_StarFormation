 - **Abstract**
 As weak lensing surveys go deeper, there is an increasing need for reliable characterization of non-Gaussian structures at small angular scales. Here we present the first cosmological constraints with weak lensing scattering transform, a statistical estimator that combines efficiency, robustness, and interpretability. With the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey (HSC) year 1 data, we obtain $\Omega_\text{m}=0.29_{-0.03}^{+0.04}$, $S_8\equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_\text{m}/0.3)^{0.5}=0.83\pm0.02$, and intrinsic alignment strength $A_\text{IA}=1.0\pm0.4$ through simulation-based forward modeling. Our constraints are consistent with those derived from Planck. The error bar of $\Omega_\text{m}$ is 2 times tighter than that obtained from the power spectrum when the same scale range is used. This constraining power is on par with that of convolutional neural networks, suggesting that further investment in spatial information extraction may not yield substantial benefits. We also point out an internal tension of $S_8$ estimates linked to a redshift bin around z ~ 1 in the HSC data. We found that discarding that bin leads to a consistent decrease of $S_8$ from 0.83 to 0.79, for all statistical estimators. We argue that photometric redshift estimation is now the main limitation in the estimation of $S_8$ using HSC. This limitation is likely to affect other ground-based weak lensing surveys reaching redshifts greater than one. Alternative redshift estimation techniques, like clustering redshifts, may help alleviate this limitation.

 - **Abstract**
 Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) are a recently discovered class of short-period pulsating variable stars. In this work, we present new information on these stars based on photometric and spectroscopic data obtained for known and new objects detected by the OGLE survey. BLAPs are evolved objects with pulsation periods in the range of 3--75 min, stretching between subdwarf B-type stars and upper main-sequence stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. In general, BLAPs are single-mode stars pulsating in the fundamental radial mode. Their phase-folded light curves are typically sawtooth shaped, but light curves of shorter-period objects are more rounded and symmetric, while many longer-period objects exhibit an additional bump. The long-term OGLE observations show that the period change rates of BLAPs are usually of the order of 10^-7 per year and in a quarter of the sample are negative. An exception is the triple-mode object OGLE-BLAP-030, which changes its dominant period much faster, at a rate of about +4.6 x 10^-6 per year. The spectroscopic data indicate that the BLAPs form a homogeneous group in the period, surface gravity, and effective temperature spaces. However, we observe a split into two groups in terms of helium-to-hydrogen content. The atmospheres of the He-enriched BLAPs are more abundant in metals (about five times) than the atmosphere of the Sun. We discover that the BLAPs obey a period--gravity relationship and we use the distance to OGLE-BLAP-009 to derive a period--luminosity relation. Most of the stars observed in the OGLE Galactic bulge fields seem to reside in the bulge, while the remaining objects likely are in the foreground Galactic disk.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new constraint on the Hubble constant ($H_0$) from the standard dark siren method using a sample of $5$ well-covered gravitational wave (GW) alerts reported during the first part of the fourth LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing runs in combination with standard dark sirens from the first three runs. Our methodology relies on the galaxy catalog method alone. We use the full probability density estimation of photometric redshifts derived by a deep learning method using the DESI Legacy Survey and DELVE galaxy catalogs. We add the constraints from the binary black hole mergers candidates S231226av, S231206cc, S230919bj, S230627c, and S230922g to the sample of standard dark sirens analyzed in Alfradique et al. (2024). We combine the $H_0$ posterior for $5$ new standard sirens with other $10$ previous events (3 with updated posteriors), finding $H_0 = 69.9^{+13.3}_{-12.0}~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% Highest Density Interval) with the catalog method alone. This result represents an improvement of $\sim 23\%$ comparing the new $15$ dark siren constrain with the previous $10$ dark siren constraint, and a reduction in uncertainty of $\sim 40\%$ from the combination of $15$ dark and bright sirens compared with the GW170817 bright siren alone. The combination of dark and bright siren GW170817 with recent jet constraints yields $H_0$ of $68.0^{+4.3}_{-3.8}~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, a $\sim 6\%$ precision from Standard Sirens, reducing the previous constraint uncertainty by $\sim 10\%$ .

 - **Abstract**
 Modeling the detection of life has never been more opportune. With next generation space telescopes, like the currently developing Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) concept, we will begin to characterize rocky exoplanets potentially similar to Earth. However, currently, few realistic planetary spectra containing surface biosignatures have been paired with direct imaging telescope instrument models. Therefore, we use a HWO instrument noise model to assess the detection of surface biosignatures affiliated with oxygenic, anoxygenic, and nonphotosynthetic extremophiles. We pair the HWO telescope model to a 1-D radiative transfer model to estimate the required exposure times necessary for detecting each biosignature on planets with global microbial coverage and varying atmospheric water vapor concentrations. For modeled planets with 0% - 50% cloud coverage, we determine pigments and the red edge could be detected within 1,000 hours (100 hours) at distances within 15 pc (11 pc). However, tighter telescope inner working angles (2.5 lambda/D) would allow surface biosignature detection at further distances. Anoxygenic photosynthetic biosignatures could also be more easily detectable than nonphotosynthetic pigments and the photosynthetic red edge when compared against a false positive iron oxide slope. Future life detection missions should evaluate the influence of false positives on the detection of multiple surface biosignatures.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have led to the discovery of numerous optically selected binaries containing an undetected component with mass consistent with a compact object (neutron star or white dwarf). Using the the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory we have carried out X-ray and UV observations of a small sample of these binaries. Four systems are wide (with orbital period P>300 d), and they were chosen because of their small distance (d<250 pc) and the mass of the collapsed component favoring a neutron star. Two other are compact systems (P<0.9 d), with convincing evidence of containing a neutron star. The source 2MASS J15274848$+$3536572 was detected in the X-ray band, with a flux of 5E-13 erg/cm2/s and a spectrum well fitted by a power law or a thermal plasma emission model. This source also showed an UV (2200 Angstrom) excess, which might indicate the presence of mass accretion. For the other targets we derived X-ray flux upper limits of the order of 1E-13}$ erg/cm2/s . These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the collapsed component in these six systems are neutron stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are known for their long-term stability. Using six years of observations from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), we have conducted an in-depth analysis of the X-ray timing results for six MSPs: PSRs B1937+21, B1821$-$24, J0437$-$4715, J0030+0451, J0218+4232, and J2124$-$3358. The timing stability parameter $\sigma_z$ has been calculated, revealing remarkable timing precision on the order of $10^{-14}$ for PSRs B1937+21 and J0437$-$4715, and $10^{-13}$ for PSRs B1821$-$24, J0218+4232, and J0030+0451 over a timescale of 1000 days. These findings underscore the feasibility of autonomous in-orbit timekeeping using X-ray observations of MSPs. In addition, the consistency of long-term spin-down noise in the X-ray and radio bands has been investigated by comparison with IPTA radio data.

 - **Abstract**
 A binary stellar system that ventures too close to a supermassive black hole can become tidally separated. In this article, we investigate the role of relativistic effects in these encounters through 3-body simulations. We use the Hybrid Relativistic-Newtonian Approximation (HRNA), which combines the exact relativistic acceleration from a Schwarzschild black hole with a Newtonian description of the binary's self-gravity. This method is compared against Newtonian and Post-Newtonian (1PN) simulations. Our findings show good agreement between HRNA and 1PN results, both of which exhibit substantial differences from Newtonian simulations. This discrepancy is particularly pronounced in retrograde encounters, where relativistic simulations predict up to $30\%$ more separation events and an earlier onset of binary separation ($\beta=2$ compared to $2.5$ in Newtonian simulations, with $\beta$ the impact parameter). Additionally, the HRNA model predicts about 15$\%$ more potential extreme mass ratio inspirals and generate a higher number of hypervelocity star candidates, with velocities up to 2,000 km/s faster than those predicted from Newtonian simulations. Furthermore, compared to Newtonian cases, relativistic encounters are more likely to result in direct stellar collisions and binary mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of the minute-to-hour long Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) localised by telescopes such as Chandra, Swift, and XMM-Newton remains mysterious, with numerous models suggested for the events. Here, we report multi-wavelength observations of EP240315a, a 1600 s long transient detected by the Einstein Probe, showing it to have a redshift of z=4.859. We measure a low column density of neutral hydrogen, indicating that the event is embedded in a low-density environment, further supported by direct detection of leaking ionising Lyman-continuum. The observed properties are consistent with EP240315a being a long-duration gamma-ray burst, and these observations support an interpretation in which a significant fraction of the FXT population are lower-luminosity examples of similar events. Such transients are detectable at high redshifts by the Einstein Probe and, in the (near) future, out to even larger distances by SVOM, THESEUS, and Athena, providing samples of events into the epoch of reionisation.

 - **Abstract**
 Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to originate from core collapse of massive stars. High-redshift GRBs can probe the star formation and reionization history of the early universe, but their detection remains rare. Here we report the detection of a GRB triggered in the 0.5--4 keV band by the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) on board the Einstein Probe (EP) mission, designated as EP240315a, whose bright peak was also detected by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope and Konus-Wind through off-line analyses. At a redshift of $z=4.859$, EP240315a showed a much longer and more complicated light curve in the soft X-ray band than in gamma-rays. Benefiting from a large field-of-view ($\sim$3600 deg$^2$) and a high sensitivity, EP-WXT captured the earlier engine activation and extended late engine activity through a continuous detection. With a peak X-ray flux at the faint end of previously known high-$z$ GRBs, the detection of EP240315a demonstrates the great potential for EP to study the early universe via GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Nested sampling parameter estimation differs from evidence estimation, in that it incurs an additional source of error. This error affects estimates of parameter means and credible intervals in gravitational wave analyses and beyond, and yet, it is typically not accounted for in standard error estimation methods. In this paper, we present two novel methods to quantify this error more accurately for any chain based nested sampler, using the additional likelihood calls made at runtime in producing independent samples. Using injected signals of black hole binary coalescences as an example, we first show concretely that the usual error estimation method is insufficient to capture the true error bar on parameter estimates. We then demonstrate how the extra points in the chains of chain based samplers may be carefully utilised to estimate this error correctly, and provide a way to check the accuracy of the resulting error bars. Finally, we discuss how this error affects $p$-$p$ plots and coverage assessments.
#### Two-Dimensional Eclipse Mapping of the Hot Jupiter WASP-43b with JWST  MIRI/LRS

 - **Abstract**
 We present eclipse maps of the two-dimensional thermal emission from the dayside of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b, derived from an observation of a phase curve with the JWST MIRI/LRS instrument. The observed eclipse shapes deviate significantly from those expected for a planet emitting uniformly over its surface. We fit a map to this deviation, constructed from spherical harmonics up to order $\ell_{\rm max}=2$, alongside the planetary, orbital, stellar, and systematic parameters. This yields a map with a meridionally-averaged eastward hot-spot shift of $(7.75 \pm 0.36)^{\circ}$, with no significant degeneracy between the map and the additional parameters. We show the latitudinal and longitudinal contributions of the day-side emission structure to the eclipse shape, finding a latitudinal signal of $\sim$200 ppm and a longitudinal signal of $\sim$250 ppm. To investigate the sensitivity of the map to the method, we fix the non-mapping parameters and derive an "eigenmap" fitted with an optimised number of orthogonal phase curves, which yields a similar map to the $\ell_{\rm max}=2$ map. We also fit a map up to $\ell_{\rm max}=3$, which shows a smaller hot-spot shift, with a larger uncertainty. These maps are similar to those produced by atmospheric simulations. We conclude that there is a significant mapping signal which constrains the spherical harmonic components of our model up to $\ell_{\rm max}=2$. Alternative mapping models may derive different structures with smaller-scale features; we suggest that further observations of WASP-43b and other planets will drive the development of more robust methods and more accurate maps.

 - **Abstract**
 Giant planets exhibit diverse orbital properties, hinting at their distinct formation and dynamic histories. In this paper, using $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3, we investigate if and how the orbital properties of Jupiters are linked to their host star properties, particularly their metallicity and age. We obtain metallicities for main sequence stars of spectral type F, G, and K, hosting hot, warm, and cold Jupiters with varying eccentricities. We compute the velocity dispersion of host stars of these three groups using kinematic information from $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3 and obtain average ages using velocity dispersion-age relation. We find that host stars of hot Jupiters are relatively metal-rich ([Fe/H]=$0.18 \pm 0.13$) and young ( median age $3.97 \pm 0.51$ Gyr) compared to the host stars of cold Jupiters in nearly circular orbits, which are relatively metal-poor ($0.03 \pm 0.18$) and older (median age $6.07 \pm 0.79$ Gyr). Host stars of cold Jupiters in high eccentric orbits, on the other hand, show metallicities similar to that of the hosts of hot Jupiters, but are older, on average (median age $6.25 \pm 0.92$ Gyr). The similarity in metallicity between hosts of hot Jupiters and hosts of cold Jupiters in high eccentric orbits supports high eccentricity migration as the potential origin of hot Jupiters, with the latter serving as the progenitors. However, the average age difference between them suggests that the older hot Jupiters may have been engulfed by the star in a timescale of $\sim 6$ Gyr. This allows us to estimate the value of stellar tidal quality factor $Q'_\ast\sim10^{6\pm1}$.
#### Rapidly-rotating Population III stellar models as a source of primary  nitrogen

 - **Abstract**
 The first stars might have been fast rotators. This would have important consequences for their radiative, mechanical and chemical feedback. We discuss the impact of fast initial rotation on the evolution of massive Population III models and on their nitrogen and oxygen stellar yields. We explore the evolution of Population III stars with initial masses in the range of 9Msol < Mini < 120Msol starting with an initial rotation on the Zero Age Main Sequence equal to 70% of the critical one. We find that with the physics of rotation considered here, our rapidly-rotating Population III stellar models do not follow a homogeneous evolution. They lose very little mass in case mechanical winds are switched on when the surface rotation becomes equal or larger than the critical velocity. Impact on the ionising flux appears modest when compared to moderately-rotating models. Fast rotation favours, in models with initial masses above ~20Msol, the appearance of a very extended intermediate convective zone around the H-burning shell during the core He-burning phase. This shell has important consequences on the sizes of the He- and CO-cores and thus impacts the final fate of stars. Moreover, it has a strong impact on nucleosynthesis boosting the production of primary 14N. Fast initial rotation impacts significantly the chemical feedback of Population III stars. Observations of extremely metal-poor stars and/or starbursting regions are essential to provide constraints on the properties of the first stars.
#### STELLA lightcurves of energetic pair instability supernovae in the  context of SN2018ibb

 - **Abstract**
 SN2018ibb is a recently observed hydrogen poor super-luminous supernova which appears to be powered by the decay of $30\;\rm{M_\odot}$ of radioactive nickel. This supernova has been suggested to show hybrid signatures of a pair instability supernova and an interacting supernova. In a previous paper, we found that rotating, metal enriched pair instability supernova progenitors appeared to check both of these boxes. In this paper, we model the lightcurves of the pair instability supernovae using STELLA. We find that the STELLA models can explain the overall shape of the bolometric lightcurve of SN2018ibb, though not specific morphological features such as the luminosity peak or the bump at roughly three hundred days after the peak. We also estimate the contribution from interaction, and find that with relatively low wind velocities, the circum-stellar medium originating from the stellar winds is consistent with the evidence for interaction in the spectra. The observed values of the photosphere velocity in the hundred days after peak luminosity are similar to the STELLA models, but the deceleration is lower. This leads to the biggest inconsistency which is the black body temperature of SN2018ibb being much hotter than any of the STELLA models. We note that this high temperature (and the flat velocity) may be difficult to reconcile with the long rise time of SN2018ibb, but nevertheless conclude that if it is accurate, this discrepancy represents a challenge for SN2018ibb being a robust PISN candidate. This result is noteworthy given the lack of other scenarios for this supernova.
#### A general polarimetric model for transiting and non-transiting ringed  exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the potential of polarimetry as a tool for detecting and characterizing exorings. For that purpose, we have improved the publicly available photometric code Pryngles by adding the results of radiative transfer calculations that fully include polarization and scattering by irregularly shaped particles. With this improved code, we compute the total and polarized fluxes and the degree of polarization of a ringed gas giant along its orbit. We vary key model parameters such as the orbit inclination, ring size and orientation, particle albedo and optical thickness, and demonstrate the versatility of our code by predicting the total and polarized fluxes of the "puffed-up" planet HIP41378f assuming this planet has an opaque dusty ring. We find that spatially unresolved dusty rings can significantly modify the flux and polarization signals of the light that is reflected. Rings are expected to have a low polarization signal and will generally decrease the degree of polarization as the ring casts a shadow on the planet and/or blocks part of the light the planet reflects. During ring-plane crossings, when the thin ring is illuminated edge-on, a ringed exoplanet's flux and degree of polarization are close to those of a ring-less planet and generally appear as sharp changes in the flux and polarization curves. Ringed planets in edge-on orbits tend to be difficult to distinguish from ring-less planets in reflected flux and degree of polarization. We show that if HIP41378f is surrounded by a ring, its reflected flux (compared to the star) will be of the order of $10^{-9}$, and the ring would decrease the degree of polarization in a detectable way. The improved version of the photometric code Pryngles that we present here shows that dusty rings may produce distinct polarimetric features in light curves across a wide range of orbital configurations, orientations and ring optical properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Studies of the rotation and activity of M type stars are essential to enhance our understanding of stellar dynamos and angular momentum evolution. Using the outstanding photometric capabilities of space telescopes rotation signals even with low amplitudes can be investigated in up to now unrivaled detail. By combining data of K2 and the TESS prime mission the star spot activity of M dwarfs can be monitored on half a decade timescale. In the framework of our study on the rotation-activity relation for bright and nearby M dwarfs we also aim at an investigation of the long-term activity. While K2 was observing fields distributed around the ecliptic plane, the TESS prime mission was oriented along a line of ecliptic longitude with one camera centered on an ecliptic pole. Due to these different observing strategies, the overlap between K2 and the TESS prime mission is marginal. However, 45 stars from our sample were observed with both missions of which two early M-type stars that fulfill our selection criteria, EPIC 202059229 and EPIC 245919787, were analyzed in more detail. We found that for both stars the rotation period did not change while the rotational phase did change for EPIC 245919787 by ~0.2. The amplitude of the spot induced variability changed for both stars but more significant for EPIC 245919787. By comparing the cumulative flare frequency distributions we found that the flare activity for EPIC 202059229 is unchanged while it slightly changes for EPIC 245919787 between the K2 and TESS epochs. Using a combination of light curves from K2 and TESS that span a baseline up to 4.5 years we could measure significant differential rotation for EPIC 245919787. Furthermore, we show that combining missions like K2 and TESS is a promising method for detecting stellar activity cycles.

 A firm establishment of the presence or the lack of periodicity in repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is crucial for determining their origins. Here we compile 1145 radio bursts of FRB 20121102A with fluence larger than 0.15 Jy ms from observations using the Five-hundredmeter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, Arecibo Observatory, Green Bank Telescope, Effelsberg Telescope, MeerKAT Telescope, Lovell Telescope, Deep Space Network 70 m radio telescopes, Very Large Array, and the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope spanning the time interval of MJD 57175-58776. A quasi-period of $157.1_{-4.8}^{+5.2}$ day and a candidate quasi-period of $4.605_{-0.010}^{+0.003}$ day are found through the phase-folding probability binomial analysis. The former is consistent with previous findings and the latter is new. The 4.605 day periodicity is more obvious in high-energy bursts with fluence larger than $10^{38}$ erg. The presence of these (candidate) quasi-periods, together with the corresponding width of burst accumulation in the phase space, are consistent with the bursts' originating from a binary degenerate star system with a close-by planet around the primary neutron star.

 During the first Gyr of their life, exoplanet atmospheres suffer from different atmospheric escape phenomena that can strongly affect the shape and morphology of the exoplanet itself. These processes can be studied with Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$ and/or He I triplet observations. We present high-resolution spectroscopy observations from CARMENES and GIARPS checking for He I and H$\alpha$ signals in 20 exoplanetary atmospheres: V1298Tau c, K2-100b, HD63433b, HD63433c, HD73583b, HD73583c, K2-77b, TOI-2076b, TOI-2048b, HD235088b, TOI-1807b, TOI-1136d, TOI-1268b, TOI-1683b, TOI-2018b, MASCARA-2b, WASP-189b, TOI-2046b, TOI-1431b, and HAT-P-57b. We report two new high-resolution spectroscopy He I detections for TOI-1268b and TOI-2018b, and an H$\alpha$ detection for TOI-1136d. The MOPYS (Measuring Out-flows in Planets orbiting Young Stars) project aims to understand the evaporating phenomena and test their predictions from the current observations. We compiled a list of 70 exoplanets with He I and/or H$\alpha$ observations, from this work and the literature, and we considered the He I and H$\alpha$ results as proxy for atmospheric escape. Our principal results are that 0.1-1Gyr-old planets do not exhibit more He I or H$\alpha$ detections than older planets, and evaporation signals are more frequent for planets orbiting $\sim$1-3Gyr-old stars. We provide new constrains to the cosmic shoreline, the empirical division between rocky planets and planets with atmosphere, by using the evaporation detections and explore the capabilities of a new dimensionless parameter, $R_{\rm He}/R_{\rm Hill}$, to explain the He I triplet detections. Furthermore, we present a statistically significant upper boundary for the He I triplet detections in the $T_{\rm eq}$ vs $\rho_{\rm p}$ parameter space. Planets located above that boundary are unlikely to show He I absorption signals.

 - **Abstract**
 The early dark energy (EDE) extension to $\Lambda$CDM has been proposed as a candidate scenario to resolve the "Hubble tension". We present new constraints on the EDE model by incorporating new data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) survey and CMB lensing measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 and \textit{Planck} NPIPE data. We do not find evidence for EDE. The maximum fractional contribution of EDE to the total energy density is $f_\mathrm{EDE}< 0.091 \; (95\% \; \mathrm{CL} )$ from our baseline combination of \textit{Planck} CMB, CMB lensing, and DESI BAO. Our strongest constraints on EDE come from the combination of \textit{Planck} CMB and CMB lensing alone, yielding $f_\mathrm{EDE}< 0.070 \; (95\% \; \mathrm{CL} )$. We also explore extensions of $\Lambda$CDM beyond the EDE parameters by treating the total neutrino mass as a free parameter, finding $\sum m_\nu < 0.096 \,\, {\rm eV} \; (95\% \; \mathrm{CL} )$ and $f_\mathrm{EDE}< 0.087 \; (95\% \; \mathrm{CL} )$. For the first time in EDE analyses, we perform Bayesian parameter estimation using neural network emulators of cosmological observables, which are on the order of a hundred times faster than full Boltzmann solutions.
#### Atmospheric Retrievals of the Phase-resolved Spectra of Irradiated Brown  Dwarfs WD-0137B and EPIC-2122B

 - **Abstract**
 We present an atmospheric retrieval analysis of HST/WFC3/G141 spectroscopic phase curve observations of two brown dwarfs, WD-0137B and EPIC-2122B, in ultra-short period orbits around white dwarf hosts. These systems are analogous to hot and ultra-hot Jupiter systems, enabling a unique and high-precision comparison to exoplanet systems. We use the PETRA retrieval suite to test various analysis setups, including joint-phase retrievals, multiple temperature structures, and non-uniform abundances. We find that WD-0137B has a dayside that closely resembles that of other ultra-hot Jupiters with inverted temperature structures and H$^-$ opacity, but quickly transitions to a mostly non-inverted temperature structure on the nightside. Meanwhile, EPIC-2122B's atmosphere remains inverted at all constrained longitudes, with dominant H$^-$ opacity. Retrievals with multiple temperature profiles and non-uniform vertical abundances were generally not statistically justified for this dataset, but retrievals with dayside-dilution factors were found to be justified. Retrieving all phases simultaneously with a linear combination of a dayside and nightside atmosphere was found to be an adequate representation of the entire phase-curve once a longitudinal temperature gradient free parameter was included in the retrieval. Comparing to global circulation models, we attribute behavior in the 1D retrievals to the inclined viewing geometry of the systems, which results in always-visible irradiated and inverted portions of the atmosphere "contaminating" spectra measured from the nightside hemisphere. This study sheds light on the similarities between these irradiated brown dwarf systems and hot and ultra-hot Jupiters, but also their unique differences, including the influence of the inclined viewing geometry.

 - **Abstract**
 Models of stepped dark radiation have recently been found to have an important impact on the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background, aiding in easing the Hubble tension. In this work, we study models with a sector of dark radiation with a step in its abundance, which thermalizes after big bang nucleosynthesis by mixing with the standard model neutrinos. For this, we extend an earlier work which has focused on the background evolution only until the dark sector thermalizes by deriving the full background and perturbation equations of the model and implementing them in an Einstein-Boltzmann solving code. We expound on the behavior of this model, discussing the wide range of parameters that result in interesting and viable cosmologies that dynamically generate dark radiation during a range of epochs. We find that for the strongly self-coupled regime, there is no large cosmological impact for a tight prior on the mass, whereas larger mass ranges allow a smooth interpolation between a behavior close to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological standard model and close to an additional component of strongly self-interacting dark radiation. In the weakly self-coupled regime we find that we can accommodate a parameter space relevant for the neutrino anomalies as well as one relevant to easing the Hubble tension.
