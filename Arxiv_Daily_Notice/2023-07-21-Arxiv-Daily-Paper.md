 - **Abstract**
 In galactic nuclei, stellar densities are so high that stars can physically collide with each other. In this work we focus on the collision of red giants and in particular on the formation of non-thermal processes through collisions and their properties. We analytically address these points by evaluating head-on collisions but also take into account scenarios with a deviation from the radial orbit, which we treat in a perturbative fashion. The collisions produce internal shocks with supersonic Mach numbers. Almost immediately, jet-like structures with important Lorentz factors form. The debris from the collision produces another shock wave which, when interacting with the interstellar medium of a galactic nucleus, leads to particle acceleration. We estimate the background flux in X- and gamma rays created by the background of these collisions by deriving the spectral index within a radius of 100 Mpc and find that they are high. Additionally, we make an estimate of the neutrino production and find about $10^{11}$ neutrinos per square meter per second for a collision at 100 Mpc from Earth. Also, we derive that there is a non-negligible chance to ignite fusion during the collision, due to the squeezing of the material. We investigate the possibility that the degenerate cores collide with each other, leading to a high afterglow luminosity, and find that it is non-negligible, although this should be addressed with dedicated numerical simulations. Colliding red giants in galactic nuclei trigger a plethora of high-energy phenomena, and have a particular gravitational wave emission associated, as shown by us, so that their detection will allow us to rule out alternatives.

 - **Abstract**
 In core-collapse supernovae, the neutrino density is so large that neutrino flavor instabilities, leading to flavor conversion, can be triggered by the forward scattering of neutrinos among each other, if a crossing between the angular distributions of electron neutrino and antineutrinos exists (fast instability) or in the presence of perturbations induced by the neutrino vacuum frequency (slow instability). Recently, it has been advanced the conjecture that neutrino collisions with the medium could be another mean to kickstart flavor change (collisional instability). We rely on a spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova model with mass $18.6\ M_\odot$, compute the neutrino angular distributions solving the kinetic equations and investigate the occurrence of flavor instabilities at different post-bounce times, ranging from the accretion phase to the early cooling phase. We find that fast and slow flavor instabilities largely dominate over the collisional ones in the decoupling region for all post-bounce times. While more work is needed to assess the relevance of collisional instabilities in neutrino-dense environments, our findings suggest that neutrino collisions with matter affect the flavor evolution in the decoupling region, but are not responsible for triggering flavor conversion.
#### Structure of the W3A Low Density Foreground Region

 - **Abstract**
 We present analysis of OI 63 micron and CO $J$ = 5-4 and 8-7 multi-position data in the W3A region and use it to develop a model for the extended low-density foreground gas that produces absorption features in the OI and $J$ = 5-4 CO lines. We employ the extinction to the exciting stars of the background HII region to constrain the total column density of the foreground gas. We have used the Meudon PDR code to model the physical conditions and chemistry in the region employing a two-component model with high density layer near the HII region responsible for the fine structure line emission, and an extended low density foreground layer. The best-fitting total proton density, constrained largely by the CO lines, is $n$(H) = 250 cm$^{-3}$ in the foreground gas, and 5$\times$10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$ in the material near the HII region. The absorption is distributed over the region mapped in W3A, and is not restricted to the foreground of either the embedded exciting stars of the HII region or the protostar W3 IRS5. The low-density material associated with regions of massive star formation, based on an earlier study by Goldsmith et al. (2021), is quite common, and we now see that it is extended over a significant portion of W3A. It thus should be included in modeling of fine structure line emission, including interpreting low-velocity resolution observations made with incoherent spectrometer systems, in order to use these lines as accurate tracers of massive star formation.
#### Decoding the compositions of four bright $r$-process-enhanced stars

 - **Abstract**
 There has been a concerted effort in recent years to identify the astrophysical sites of the $r$-process that can operate early in the Galaxy. The discovery of many $r$-process-enhanced (RPE) stars (especially by the $R$-process Alliance collaboration) has significantly accelerated this effort. However, only limited data exist on the detailed elemental abundances covering the primary neutron-capture peaks. Subtle differences in the structure of the $r$-process pattern, such as the relative abundances of elements in the third peak, in particular, are expected to constrain the $r$-process sites further. Here, we present a detailed elemental-abundance analysis of four bright RPE stars selected from the HESP-GOMPA survey. Observations were carried out with the 10-m class telescope Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), Spain. The high spectral signal-to-noise ratios obtained allow us to derive abundances for 20 neutron-capture elements, including the third $r$-process peak element osmium (Os). We detect thorium (Th) in two stars, which we use to estimate their ages. We discuss the metallicity evolution of Mg, Sr, Ba, Eu, Os, and Th in $r$-II and $r$-I stars, based on a compilation of RPE stars from the literature. The strontium (Sr) abundance trend with respect to europium (Eu) suggests the need for an additional production site for Sr (similar to several earlier studies); this requirement could be milder for yttrium (Y) and zirconium (Zr). We also show that there could be some time delay between $r$-II and $r$-I star formation, based on the Mg/Th abundance ratios.

 - **Abstract**
 We present numerical results from a parameter study of the standing accretion shock instability (SASI), investigating the impact of general relativity (GR) on the dynamics. Using GR hydrodynamics and gravity, and non-relativistic (NR) hydrodynamics and gravity, in an idealized model setting, we vary the initial radius of the shock and, by varying its mass and radius in concert, the proto-neutron star (PNS) compactness. We investigate two regimes expected in a post-bounce core-collapse supernova (CCSN): one meant to resemble a relatively low-compactness configuration and one meant to resemble a relatively high-compactness configuration. We find that GR leads to a longer SASI oscillation period, with ratios between the GR and NR cases as large as 1.29 for the high-compactness suite. We also find that GR leads to a slower SASI growth rate, with ratios between the GR and NR cases as low as 0.47 for the high-compactness suite. We discuss implications of our results for CCSN simulations.
#### Angular momentum and lithium transport from main sequence to sub-giant  and red giant low-mass stars

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismology provides a unique opportunity to probe the interiors of evolved stars and constrain their internal rotation. The correct reproduction of the core rotation evolution is key to understanding the internal processes involved in low-mass stars. We explore the efficiency required to reproduce the behaviour of the transport of angular momentum (AM) in view of asteroseismic constraints. We computed a series of models and investigated an updated AM transport by including a time-dependent extra viscosity related to the AMRI. We compared our predictions to the asteroseismic measurements of the core and surface rotation of a sample of SGB and RGB stars. We confirm that a time-dependent additional viscosity is required to reproduce the general behaviour of the core rotation rate along evolution. We show that it results in stronger Li and Be depletions for low-mass stars over evolution. We confirm that predicted Li abundances at the RGB bump by classical models, commonly used as references, cannot reproduce the Li depletion along the MS and evolved phases of stellar evolution. We show that the observed amount of Li of stars less massive than 1Msun leads to a discrepancy between model predictions and observations at the RGB bump. We show that a semi-parametric model can reproduce the rotational behaviour along the first phases of evolution well, with the exception of the sharp transition observed during the SGB phase. This suggests that two distinct transport processes may be involved. The processes required to transport chemicals during the MS, and AM until the RGB phase impact the Li depletion all along the evolutionary duration. A good prediction of the Li abundance at young phases places strong constraints on the predicted one at more evolved phases. It also impacts the threshold that defines Li-rich giant stars, showing that classical models tend to overestimate its value.
