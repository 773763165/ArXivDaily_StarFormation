 - **Abstract**
 Tentative observations of cosmic-ray antihelium by the AMS-02 collaboration have re-energized the quest to use antinuclei to search for physics beyond the standard model. However, our transition to a data-driven era requires more accurate models of the expected astrophysical antinuclei fluxes. We use a state-of-the-art cosmic-ray propagation model, fit to high-precision antiproton and cosmic-ray nuclei (B, Be, Li) data, to constrain the antinuclei flux from both astrophysical and dark matter annihilation models. We show that astrophysical sources are capable of producing $\mathcal{O}(1)$ antideuteron events and $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ antihelium-3 events over 15~years of AMS-02 observations. Standard dark matter models could potentially produce higher levels of these antinuclei, but showing a different energy-dependence. Given the uncertainties in these models, dark matter annihilation is still the most promising candidate to explain preliminary AMS-02 results. Meanwhile, any robust detection of antihelium-4 events would require more novel dark matter model building or a new astrophisical production mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of transient and variable events, including novae, active galactic nuclei, and black hole binaries, has historically been a fruitful path for elucidating the evolutionary mechanisms of our universe. The study of such events in the millimeter and submillimeter is, however, still in its infancy. Submillimeter observations probe a variety of materials, such as optically thick dust, which are hard to study in other wavelengths. Submillimeter observations are sensitive to a number of emission mechanisms, from the aforementioned cold dust, to hot free-free emission, and synchrotron emission from energetic particles. Study of these phenomena has been hampered by a lack of prompt, high sensitivity submillimeter follow-up, as well as by a lack of high-sky-coverage submillimeter surveys. In this paper, we describe how the proposed Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) could fill in these gaps in our understanding of the transient universe. We discuss a number of science cases that would benefit from AtLAST observations, and detail how AtLAST is uniquely suited to contributing to them. In particular, AtLAST's large field of view will enable serendipitous detections of transient events, while its anticipated ability to get on source quickly and observe simultaneously in multiple bands make it also ideally suited for transient follow-up. We make theoretical predictions for the instrumental and observatory properties required to significantly contribute to these science cases, and compare them to the projected AtLAST capabilities. Finally, we consider the unique ways in which transient science cases constrain the observational strategies of AtLAST, and make prescriptions for how AtLAST should observe in order to maximize its transient science output without impinging on other science cases.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a hidden Markov model (HMM) for discovering stellar flares in light curve data of stars. HMMs provide a framework to model time series data that are not stationary; they allow for systems to be in different states at different times and consider the probabilities that describe the switching dynamics between states. In the context of stellar flares discovery, we exploit the HMM framework by allowing the light curve of a star to be in one of three states at any given time step: Quiet, Firing, or Decaying. This three state HMM formulation is designed to enable straightforward identification of stellar flares, their duration, and associated uncertainty. This is crucial for estimating the flare's energy, and is useful for studies of stellar flare energy distributions. We combine our HMM with a celerite model that accounts for quasi periodic stellar oscillations. Through an injection recovery experiment, we demonstrate and evaluate the ability of our method to detect and characterize flares in stellar time series. We also show that the proposed HMM flags fainter and lower energy flares more easily than traditional sigma clipping methods. Lastly, we visually demonstrate that simultaneously conducting detrending and flare detection can mitigate biased estimations arising in multistage modelling approaches. Thus, this method paves a new way to calculating stellar flare energy. We conclude with an example application to one star observed by TESS, showing how the HMM compares with sigma clipping when using real data.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the atmospheric parameters of stars on the top of the RGB is essential to reveal the chemical composition of the Milky Way, as they can be used to probe the farthest parts of our Galaxy. Our goal is to determine the chemical composition of 21 RGB stars with $T_{\mathrm{eff}}<4200$K selected from the APOGEE-2 DR17 database using new observations carried out with the spectrograph mounted on the 1-m telescope of the Hungarian Piszk\'estet\H{o} Observatory and the SONG spectrograph (R=77000) on the Hertzsprung SONG telescope in the 4500$-$5800\r{A} wavelength range. This is the first time the spectrograph (R=18000) on the 1-m telescope at Piszk\'estet\H{o} Observatory was used to measure the abundances of stars. We created a new LTE spectral library using MARCS model atmospheres and SYNSPEC by including the line list of 23 molecules to determine atmospheric parameters ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], [$\alpha$/Fe]) and abundances of Si, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Ni with FERRE. The resulting parameters were compared to that of APOGEE. We found a good agreement in general, the average difference is $-$11.2K in $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, 0.11dex in $\log g$, 0.10dex in [Fe/H], and $-$0.01dex in [$\alpha$/Fe]. Our analysis successfully demonstrates the ability of the spectrograph at Piszk\'estet\H{o} Observatory to reliably measure the abundance of bright stars.
#### Strong-lensing and kinematic analysis of CASSOWARY 31: can strong  lensing constrain the masses of multi-plane lenses?

 - **Abstract**
 We present a mass measurement for the secondary lens along the line of sight (LoS) in the multi-plane strong lens modeling of the group-scale lens CASSOWARY 31 (CSWA 31). The secondary lens at redshift $z = 1.49$ is a spiral galaxy well aligned along the LoS with the main lens at $z = 0.683$. Using the MUSE integral-field spectroscopy of this spiral galaxy, we measure its rotation velocities and determine the mass from the gas kinematics. We compare the mass estimation of the secondary lens from the lensing models to the mass measurement from kinematics, finding that the predictions from strong lensing tend to be higher. By introducing an additional lens plane at $z = 1.36$ for an overdensity known to be present, we find a mass of $\simeq 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ enclosed within 3.3 kpc from the centroid of the spiral galaxy, approaching the estimate from kinematics. This shows that secondary-lens mass measurements from multiple-plane modeling are affected by systematic uncertainties from the degeneracies between lens planes and the complex LoS structure. Conducting a detailed analysis of the LoS structures is therefore essential to improve the mass measurement of the secondary lens.
#### Ultra-high frequency gravitational waves from cosmic strings with  friction

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13213
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13213
 - **Abstract**
 We include the effect of the frictional force caused by interactions between cosmic strings and the particles of the background plasma in the computation of the stochastic gravitational wave background generated by cosmic string loops. Although our results show that friction leads to a partial suppression of the emission of gravitational radiation by cosmic string loops, we also find that loop production is very intense in the early stages of the Kibble regime. We show that, in many instances, this leads to a prominent signature of friction in the ultra-high frequency range of the spectrum, in the form of a secondary peak. The signature of friction is not only sensitive to cosmic string properties, but also to the initial conditions of the network and its surroundings. A detection of this signature would then allow us to extract information about the physics of the early universe that cannot be uncovered when probing the rest of the stochastic gravitational wave background spectrum.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13271
 - **Abstract**
 We calculate the $\mu$- and \textit{y}-type spectral distortions of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), taking a non-standard interaction between baryons and viscous dark matter. Using the CMB spectral distortion observations, we can constrain any exotic mechanism that may change the energy of the CMB photon, leading to a CMB spectrum distortion. Depending on the viscosity of dark matter, the energy transfer between dark matter and baryons may modify, leading to a modification in CMB distortion. The existing Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE)/FIRAS and the Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) set limits on \textit{y} and $\mu$ types of distortions to $y = 1.5\times10^{-5}$, $\mu = 9.0\times10^{-5}$ and $y = 10^{-8}$, $\mu = 5.0\times10^{-8}$, respectively. In this paper, we discuss the pre-recombination contributions to $\mu$ and \textit{y}-type distortions by viscous dark matter and constrain the parameter space using PIXIE bounds on spectral distortion.
#### Exploring the Orbital Alignments of Galactic Close White Dwarf Binaries  with LISA

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13313
 - **Abstract**
 Using the proposed space gravitational wave detector LISA, we will be able to measure the geometrical configurations of $\sim 10^4$ close white dwarf binaries in our Galaxy. The obtained data will be an entirely new resource to examine the randomness of their orbital orientations. Partly motivated by a recent reported on the systematic alignments of bulge planetary nebulae, we discuss the outlook of the orientational analysis with LISA. We find that a quadrupole pattern as small as $\sim 0.05$ can be detected for bulge white dwarf binaries, owing to their large available number. From such a pattern analysis, we might geometrically explore fossil records in our Galaxy billions of years ago.
#### Two-component off-axis jet model for radio flares of tidal disruption  events

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, radio emission from tidal disruption events (TDEs) has been observed from months to years after the optical discovery. Some of the TDEs including ASASSN-14ae, ASASSN-15oi, AT 2018hyz, and AT 2019dsg are accompanied by the late-time rebrightening phase characterized by a rapid increase in the radio flux. We show that it can be explained by the off-axis two-component jet model, in which the late-time rebrightening arises from the off-axis view of a decelerating narrower jet with an initial Lorentz factor of ~10 and a jet opening angle of ~0.1 rad, while the early-time radio emission is attributed to the off-axis view of a wider jet component. We also argue that the rate density of jetted TDEs inferred from these events is consistent with the observations.
#### Exploring Detached Eclipsing Binary Systems from TESS Observations:  Insights into OBA-type Systems and Orbital Circularization

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents photometric solutions for a carefully selected sample of 181 detached eclipsing binary systems recently observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. Our findings contribute to discussions about OBA-type systems and the orbital circularization influenced by tidal interactions. The results encompass crucial parameters, including the sum of radii fraction ($r_{\rm a}\,+\,r_{\rm b}$), radii ratio ($k$), orbital inclination ($i$), surface brightness ratio ($J$), and combinations of the longitude of the periastron and orbital eccentricity ($e\,\sin\,\omega$ and $e\,\cos\,\omega$). Geometric light curve fitting is performed using version 43 of the {\sc jktebop} code, serving as the primary tool for determining orbital elements and physical ratios. Careful uncertainty estimates for these findings are derived through bootstrap simulations. This work introduces unprecedented photometric solutions for 172 well-detached eclipsing systems, while the results for the remaining nine systems exhibit excellent agreement with those previously reported in the literature. Additionally, a critical primary radius fraction ($R_{\rm a}/a$) of 0.266 is identified for our sample of radiative envelope stars, consistent with observational and theoretical findings in the literature. Finally, we determine a circularization period of 5.762 days based on a function from the literature, revealing a discrepancy with Zahn's theory for hot stars.
#### Is climate variability the result of frequency modulation by the solar  cycle? Evidence from the El Nino Southern Oscillation, Australian climate,  Central England Temperature, and reconstructed solar activity and climate  records

 - **Abstract**
 Oceanic atmospheric oscillations and climate variability are tightly linked and both exhibit broad band spectral content that ranges, with roughly equal strength, from annual to centennial periodicity. The explanation for variability based on the integration of weather noise leads to a spectral content heavily weighted to low frequencies; explaining the variability as resulting from solar forcing leads to a narrow band, approximately eleven year period, spectral content. In both cases the spectral content is incompatible with the observed spectrum. It is known that the Southern Oscillation is frequency modulated, i.e. the time interval between successive events varies on an approximately centenary scale. In this paper we develop a model of the Southern Oscillation responding to the slowly changing frequency of the solar cycle. This results in a frequency modulated oscillation, the spectrum of which is intrinsically broad and flat and therefore compatible with the observed spectrum. Fortunately, the change in frequency of the solar cycle with time has been reconstructed from tree ring data for the last millennium. It is possible to identify time intervals when the frequency was dominated by a single frequency in which case the model oscillation is relatively simple. The 11 year period component of the model time variation was shown to correlate closely with the 11 year period components of observed Southern Oscillation and climate variability. A characteristic of a frequency modulated variable, the equal spacing of spectral peaks, was utilized via a double Fourier transform method to recover solar cycle periodicity from instrumental and reconstructed climate records, with the recovered periodicity and the known periodicity of the solar cycle in good agreement. The concept outlined provides a new way of viewing and assessing the Sun climate connection.

 - **Abstract**
 In the past decade, ALMA observations of protoplanetary disks revealed various substructures including gaps and rings. Their origin may be probed through statistical studies on the physical properties of the substructures. We present the analyses of archival ALMA Band 6 continuum data of 43 disks (39 Class II and 4 Herbig Ae) in the Taurus-Auriga region. We employ a novel 2D super-resolution imaging technique based on sparse modeling to obtain images with high fidelity and spatial resolution. As a result, we have obtained images with spatial resolutions comparable to a few au ($0''.02 - 0''.1$), which is two to three times better than conventional CLEAN methods. All dust disks are spatially resolved, with the radii ranging from 8 to 238 au with a median radius of 45 au. Half of the disks harbor clear gap structures, whose radial locations show a bimodal distribution with peaks at $\lesssim20$ au and $\gtrsim30$ au. We also see structures indicating weak gaps at all the radii in the disk. We find that the widths of these gaps increase with their depths, which is consistent with the model of planet-disk interactions. The inferred planet mass-orbital radius distribution indicates that the planet distribution is analogous to our Solar System. However, planets with Neptune mass or lower may exist in all the radii.
#### The PEPSI Exoplanet Transit Survey (PETS). V: New Na D transmission  spectra indicate a quieter atmosphere on HD 189733b

 - **Abstract**
 Absorption lines from exoplanet atmospheres observed in transmission allow us to study atmospheric characteristics such as winds. We present a new high-resolution transit time-series of HD 189733b, acquired with the PEPSI instrument at the LBT and analyze the transmission spectrum around the Na D lines. We model the spectral signature of the RM-CLV-effect using synthetic PHOENIX spectra based on spherical LTE atmospheric models. We find a Na D absorption signature between the second and third contact but not during the ingress and egress phases, which casts doubt on the planetary origin of the signal. Presupposing a planetary origin of the signal, the results suggest a weak day-to-nightside streaming wind in the order of 0.7 km/s and a moderate super-rotational streaming wind in the order of 3 - 4 km/s, challenging claims of prevailing strong winds on HD 189733b.
#### New galaxy UV luminosity constraints on warm dark matter from JWST

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13596
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13596
 - **Abstract**
 We exploit the recent {\it James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) determination of galaxy UV luminosity functions over the redshift range $z=9-14.5$ to derive constraints on warm dark matter (WDM) models. The delayed structure formation in WDM universe makes high redshift observations to be a powerful probe to set limits on the particle mass $m_\mathrm{x}$ of WDM candidates. By integrating these observations with blank-field surveys conducted by {\it Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) at redshifts $z=4-8$, we impose constraints on both astrophysical and WDM parameters simultaneously. We find a new limit of $m_\mathrm{x} \geq 3.2$ keV for the mass of thermal relic WDM particles at $95\%$ confidence level. This bound is tighter than the most stringent result derived using HST data before. Future JWST observations could further reduce the observation uncertainties and improve this constraint.
#### Rapid Optical Flare in the Extreme TeV Blazar 1ES 0229+200 on Intraday  Timescale with TESS

 - **Abstract**
 The extreme TeV blazar 1ES 0229+200 is a high-frequency-peaked BL Lacertae object. It has not shown intraday variability in extensive optical and X-ray observations. Nor has it shown any significant variability on any measurable timescale in the 1-100 GeV energy range over a 14-year span, but variations in the source flux around its average are present in the energy range above 200 GeV. We searched for intraday optical variability in 1ES 0229+200 as part of an ongoing project to search for variability and quasi-periodic oscillations in the high-cadence, nearly uniformly sampled optical light curves of blazars provided by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). 1ES 0229+200 was monitored by TESS in its Sectors 42, 43 and 44. We analysed the data of all these sectors both with the TESS provided lightkurve software and the eleanor reduction pipeline. We detected a strong, essentially symmetric flare that lasted ~6 hours in Sector 42. We fit the flare's rising and declining phases to exponential functions. We also analysed the light curve of Sector 42 using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP) and continuous auto-regressive moving average (CARMA) methods. The Sector 42 light curve displayed in the present work provides the first evidence of a strong, rapid, short-lived optical flare on the intraday timescale in 1ES 0229+200. The variability timescale of the flare provides the upper limit for the size of the emission region to be within (3.3\pm0.2 - 8.3\pm0.5)x10^{15}cm. Away from the flare, the slope of the periodogram's power spectrum is fairly typical of many blazars (\alpha<2), but the nominal slopes for the flaring regions are very steep (\alpha~4.3), which may indicate the electron distribution undergoes a sudden change. We discuss possible emission mechanisms that could explain this substantial and rapid flare.
#### Empirical stability criteria for 3D hierarchical triple systems I:  Circumbinary planets

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13746
 - **Abstract**
 In this work we revisit the problem of the dynamical stability of hierarchical triple systems with applications to circumbinary planetary orbits. We carry out more than 3 10^8 numerical simulations of planets between the size of Mercury and the lower fusion boundary (13 Jupiter masses) which revolve around the center of mass of a stellar binary over long timescales. For the first time, three dimensional and eccentric planetary orbits are considered. We explore systems with a variety of binary and planetary mass ratios, binary and planetary eccentricities from 0 to 0.9 and orbital mutual inclinations ranging from 0 to 180 degrees. The simulation time is set to 10^6 planetary orbital periods. We classify the results of those long term numerical integrations into three categories: stable, unstable and mixed. We provide empirical expressions in the form of multidimensional, parameterized fits for the two borders that separate the three dynamical domains . In addition, we train a machine learning model on our data set in order to have an alternative tool of predicting the stability of circumbinary planets. Both the empirical fits and the machine learning model are tested against randomly generated circumbinary systems with very good results regarding the predictions of orbital stability. The empirical formulae are also applied to the Kepler and TESS circumbinary systems, confirming the stability of the planets in these systems. Finally, we present a REST API with a web based application for convenient access of our simulation data set.
#### TOI-837b is a Young Saturn-sized Exoplanet with a Massive 70  $M_{\oplus}$ Core

 - **Abstract**
 We present an exhaustive photometric and spectroscopic analysis of TOI-837, a F9/G0 35 Myr young star, hosting a transiting exoplanet, TOI-837b, with an orbital period of 8.32d. Utilising data from TESS and ground-based observations, we determine a planetary radius of 0.82 R_J for TOI-837b. Through detailed HARPS spectroscopic time series analysis, we derive a Doppler semi-amplitude of 36 m/s, corresponding to a planetary mass of 0.39 M_J. The derived planetary properties suggest a substantial core of approximately 70 M_E, constituting about 60% of the planet's total mass. This finding poses a significant challenge to existing theoretical models of core formation. We propose that future atmospheric observations with JWST could provide insights into resolving ambiguities of TOI-837b, offering new perspectives on its composition, formation, and evolution.
#### A Cyclic Spectroscopy Scintillation Study of PSR B1937+21 I.  Demonstration of Improved Scintillometry

 - **Abstract**
 We use cyclic spectroscopy to perform high frequency-resolution analyses of multi-hour baseband Arecibo observations of the millisecond pulsar PSR B1937+21. This technique allows for the examination of scintillation features in far greater detail than is otherwise possible under most pulsar timing array observing setups. We measure scintillation bandwidths and timescales in each of eight subbands across a 200 MHz observing band in each observation. Through these measurements we obtain robust, intra-epoch estimates of the frequency scalings for scintillation bandwidth and timescale. Thanks to our high frequency resolution and the narrow scintles of this pulsar, we resolve scintillation arcs in the secondary spectra due to the increased Nyquist limit, which would not have been resolved at the same observing frequency with a traditional filterbank spectrum using NANOGrav's current time and frequency resolutions, and the frequency-dependent evolution of scintillation arc features within individual observations. We observe the dimming of prominent arc features at higher frequencies, possibly due to a combination of decreasing flux density and undetermined effects due to the interstellar medium. We also find agreement with arc curvature frequency dependence predicted by Stinebring et al. (2001) in some epochs. Thanks to the frequency resolution improvement provided by cyclic spectroscopy, these results show strong promise for future such analyses with millisecond pulsars, particularly for pulsar timing arrays, where such techniques can allow for detailed studies of the interstellar medium in highly scattered pulsars without sacrificing the timing resolution that is crucial to their gravitational wave detection efforts.

 - **Abstract**
 The Jupiter-Saturn chaotic excitation (JSCE) scenario proposes that the protoplanetary disk was dynamically excited and depleted beyond ~1-1.5 au in a few Myr, offering a new and plausible explanation for several observed properties of the inner solar system. Here, we expanded our previous work by conducting a comprehensive analysis of 37 optimal terrestrial planet systems obtained in the context of the JSCE scenario. Each optimal system harbored exactly four terrestrial planets analogs to Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. We further investigated water delivery, feeding zones, and accretion history for the planet analogs, which allowed us to better constrain the water distribution in the disk. The main findings of this work are as follows: 1) the formation of four terrestrial planets with orbits and masses similar to those observed in our solar system in most of our sample, as evidenced by the dynamically colder and hotter orbits of Venus-Earth and Mercury-Mars analogs, and the high success rates of similar mutual orbital separations (~40-85%) and mass ratios of the planets (~70-90%) among the 37 systems; and 2) water was delivered to all terrestrial planets during their formation through the accretion of water-bearing disk objects from beyond ~1-1.5 au. The achievement of Earth's estimated bulk water content required the disk to contain sufficient water mass distributed within those objects initially. This requirement implies that Mercury, Venus, and Mars acquired water similar to the amount on Earth during their formation. Several of our planet analogs also matched additional constraints, such as the timing of Moon formation by a giant impact, Earth's late accretion mass and composition, and Mars's formation timescale.

 - **Abstract**
 The spectral signatures of optical absorbers, when combined with those of infrared molecules, play a critical role in constraining the cloud properties of exoplanet atmospheres. We aim to use optical transmission spectroscopy to confirm the tentative color signature previously observed by multiband photometry in the atmosphere of hot Jupiter HAT-P-55b. We observed a transit of HAT-P-55b with the OSIRIS spectrograph on the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). We created two sets of spectroscopic light curves using the conventional band-integrated method and the newly proposed pixel-based method to derive the transmission spectrum. We performed Bayesian spectral retrieval analyses on the transmission spectrum to interpret the observed atmospheric properties. The transmission spectra derived from the two methods are consistent, both spectrally resolving the tentative color signature observed by MuSCAT2. The retrievals on the combined OSIRIS and MuSCAT2 transmission spectrum yield the detection of Na at 5.5$\sigma$ and the tentative detection of MgH at 3.4$\sigma$. The current optical-only wavelength coverage cannot constrain the absolute abundances of the atmospheric species. Space-based observations covering the molecular infrared bands or ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy are needed to further constrain the atmospheric properties of HAT-P-55b.

 - **Abstract**
 We have carried out a quantitative analysis of the $1^{\circ} \times 1^{\circ}$ region near star-forming site AFGL 5157 using 'Minimal Spanning Tree' (MST). The analysis reveals that this region consists of five major clusters. The cluster radii of the cores and active regions were found to be varying between 0.75-2.62 pc and 2.77-4.58 pc, respectively, for these regions, while the aspect ratio varies between 0.71 to 7.17. This hints towards the clumpy as well as elongated clusters in the region. We calculated structure parameter Q for each region which varies between 0.41-0.62 and 0.23-0.81 for the cores and ARs, respectively. This shows the existence of fractal distribution in all the cores and ARs except the core of the [HKS2019] E70 bubble.

 - **Abstract**
 The study conducted in this research paper utilizes the $f(Q,T)$ gravity, where $Q$ represents non-metricity and $T$ represents the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, to investigate the accelerated expansion of the universe. To complete the study, an effective EoS with one parameter $\alpha$, is parameterized as $\omega _{eff}=-\frac{3}{\alpha (1+z)^{3}+3}$. The linear version of $f(Q,T)=-Q+\sigma T$ is also considered, where $\sigma$ is a constant. By constraining the model with six BAO points, 57 Hubble points, and 1048 Pantheon sample datasets, the parameters $\alpha$ and $\sigma$ are determined to best match the data. The cosmological parameters and energy conditions for the model are derived and examined. The results show that the model is in good agreement with observations, and can serve as a valuable starting point for analyzing FLRW models in the $f(Q,T)$ theory of gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia can not individually resolve very close binary systems, however, the collected data can still be used to identify them. A powerful indicator of stellar multiplicity is the sources reported Renormalized Unit Weight Error (ruwe), which effectively captures the astrometric deviations from single-source solutions. We aim to characterise the imprints left on ruwe caused by binarity. By flagging potential binary systems based on ruwe, we aim to characterise which of their properties will contribute the most to their detectability. We develop a model to estimate ruwe values for observations of Gaia sources, based on the biases to the single-source astrometric track arising from the presence of an unseen companion. Then, using the recipes from previous GaiaUnlimited selection functions, we estimate the selection probability of sources with high ruwe, and discuss what binary properties contribute to increasing the sources ruwe. We compute the maximum ruwe value which is compatible with single-source solutions as a function of their location on-sky. We see that binary systems selected as sources with a ruwe higher than this sky-varying threshold have a strong detectability window in their orbital period distribution, which peaks at periods equal to the Gaia observation time baseline. We demonstrate how our sky-varying ruwe threshold provides a more complete sample of binary systems when compared to single sky-averaged values by studying the unresolved binary population in the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars. We provide the code and tools used in this study, as well as the sky-varying ruwe threshold through the GaiaUnlimited Python package

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of a long X-ray burst triggered on MJD 60171.65 from the ultra-compact binary 4U 1850$-$087 by the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image and Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). We analyse the NICER data observed in between MJD 60095.19$-$60177.43, including one observation covered part of the long X-ray burst tail, i.e., $0.15-3.8$ hr after the trigger. The persistent spectra are quite similar and well described by a combination of multi-color disk blackbody, with the inner temperature of 0.5 keV, and a thermally comptonized continuum with the asymptotic power-law photon index of $\Gamma\sim2.2$, and electron temperature of $kT_{\rm e}\sim20-30$ keV. The persistent fluxes were around $3.8\times10^{-10}~{\rm erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$, corresponding to a local accretion rate of $1\%~\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}$. Part of time-resolved burst spectra show a clear deviation from the blackbody model, which can be improved by considering the enhanced persistent emission due to the Poynting-Robertson drag, or the reflected disk emission illuminated by the burst. From the burst flux during the cooling tail, we estimate the burst duration, $\tau \approx 0.78$ hr, the burst fluence, $E_\mathrm{b} \approx 4.1 \times 10^{41}$ ergs, and the ignition column depth, $y_{\rm ign}\approx 3.5\times10^{10}~{\rm g~cm^{-2}}$. We propose that the long X-ray burst is powered by unstable burning of pure helium in deep layer. Moreover, we identify significant 1 keV emission lines in the burst spectra, which may originate from the surrounding disk.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first comprehensive chemical study of a representative sample of 27 luminous red giant branch (RGB) stars belonging to Liller 1, a complex stellar system in the Galactic bulge. This study is based on medium-resolution near-infrared spectra acquired with X-shooter at the Very Large Telescope. We found a subpopulation counting 22 stars with subsolar metallicity ($<$[Fe/H]$>=-0.31\pm0.02$ and 1$\sigma$ dispersion of 0.08 dex) and with enhanced [$\alpha$/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [K/Fe] that likely formed early and quickly from gas that was mainly enriched by type II supernovae, and a metal-rich population counting 5 stars with supersolar metallicity ($<$[Fe/H]$>$=+0.22$\pm$0.03 and 1$\sigma$ dispersion of 0.06 dex) and roughly solar-scaled [$\alpha$/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [K/Fe] that formed at later epochs from gas that was also enriched by type Ia supernovae. Moreover, both subpopulations show enhanced [Na/Fe], as in the bulge field, about solar-scaled [V/Fe], and depletion of [C/Fe] and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C with respect to the solar values. This indicates that mixing and extra-mixing processes during the RGB evolution also occur at very high metallicities. Notably, no evidence of a Na-O anticorrelation, which is considered the fingerprint of genuine globular clusters, has been found. This challenges any formation scenarios that invoke the accretion of a molecular cloud or an additional stellar system onto a genuine globular cluster. The results of this study underline the strong chemical similarity between Liller 1 and Terzan 5 and support the hypothesis that these complex stellar systems might be fossil fragments of the epoch of Galactic bulge formation.

 Quantum computing represents a cutting-edge frontier in artificial intelligence. It makes use of hybrid quantum-classical computation which tries to leverage quantum mechanic principles that allow us to use a different approach to deep learning classification problems. The work presented here falls within the context of the AGILE space mission, launched in 2007 by the Italian Space Agency. We implement different Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN) that analyze data acquired by the instruments onboard AGILE to detect Gamma-Ray Bursts from sky maps or light curves. We use several frameworks such as TensorFlow-Quantum, Qiskit and PennyLane to simulate a quantum computer. We achieved an accuracy of 95.1% on sky maps with QCNNs, while the classical counterpart achieved 98.8% on the same data, using however hundreds of thousands more parameters.

 In this work, we investigate the phenomenologically emergent dark energy (PEDE) model and its generalized form, namely the generalized emergent dark energy (GEDE) model, which introduces a free parameter \unboldmath {\( \Delta \)} that can discriminate between the \unboldmath{$\mathrm{\Lambda}$}CDM model and the PEDE model. Fitting the emergent dark energy (EDE) models with the observational datasets including the cosmology-independent gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at high-redshift and the observational Hubble data (OHD), we find a large value of $H_0$ which is close to the results of local measurement of $H_0$ from the SH0ES Collaboration in both EDE models. These results suggest that PEDE and GEDE models can %serve as an important supplement and be possible alternative to the standard cosmological model, pending further theoretical explorations and observational verifications.

 - **Abstract**
 The Spitzer instability leads to the formation of a black hole sub-system (BHSub) at the center of a star cluster providing energy to luminous stars (LSs) and increasing their rate of evaporation. When the self-depletion time of the BHSub exceeds the evaporation time of the LSs, a dark star cluster (DSC) will appear. Using the NBODY7 code, we performed a comprehensive set of direct \Nbody simulations over a wide range of initial conditions to study the pure effect of the top-heaviness of the IMF on the formation of the DSC phase. In the Galactic tidal field, top-heavy IMFs lead to the fast evaporation of LSs and the formation of DSCs. Therefore, DSCs can be present even in the outer region of the Milky Way (MW). To successfully transition to the DSC phase, the MW Globular Clusters (GCs) must possess an initial BH mass fraction of $\widetilde{\mathit{M}}_\mathrm{BH}(0)>0.05$. For star clusters with $\widetilde{\mathit{M}}_\mathrm{BH}(0)>0.08$, the DSC phase will be created for any given initial density of the cluster and Galactocentric distance. The duration of the cluster's lifetime spent in the DSC phase shows a negative (positive) correlation with the initial density, and Galactocentric distance of the star cluster if $\widetilde{\mathit{M}}_\mathrm{BH}(0)\leq 0.12$ ($\widetilde{\mathit{M}}_\mathrm{BH}(0)\geq 0.15$). Considering the canonical IMF, it is unlikely for any MW GCs to enter the DSC phase. We discuss the BH retention fraction in view of the observed properties of the GCs of the MW.

 - **Abstract**
 We report a multi-wavelength study of the Wolf Rayet (WR) star: [KSF2015] 1381-19L, which is located in the solar metallicity region (Z=0.014) of the Milky Way Galaxy, strongly obscured by the interstellar dust. We perform a detailed characterization of the stellar atmosphere by fitting the spectral emission lines observed in the Optical and Near-InfraRed (NIR) bands, using CMFGEN. The best-fitted spectroscopic model indicates a highly luminous ($10^{5.89}L_{\odot}$) star with a larger radius ($15\,R_{\odot}$) and effective temperature, wind terminal velocity, and chemical composition similar to that of Galactic WC9-dusty (WC9d)-type stars. The atmospheric ionization structure shows coexisting ionization states of different elements, simultaneously affecting the opacity and thermal electron balance. Fitting of the spectral energy data (SED) reveals high interstellar optical extinction ($A_{V}=$ 8.87) while the IR extinction is found to be comparatively lower ($A_{K_{s}}=$ 0.98). We do not detect any excess emission at near-IR wavelengths due to dust. Upon comparison of our results with the GENEVA single star evolutionary models (Z=0.014), we identify the best possible progenitors ( a rotating star of $67\,M_{\odot}$ and a non-rotating star of $90\,M_{\odot}$).
#### Mass-radius relationships and contraction of condensed planets by  cooling or despinning

 - **Abstract**
 Condensed planets contract or expand as their temperature changes. With the exception of the effect of phase changes, this phenomenon is generally interpreted as being solely related to the thermal expansivity of the planet's components. However, changes in density affect pressure and gravity and, consequently, the planet's compressibility. A planet's radius is also linked to its rate of rotation. Here again, changes in pressure, gravity and compressibility are coupled. In this article we clarify how the radius of a condensed planet changes with temperature and rotation, using a simple and rigorous thermodynamic model. We consider condensed materials to obey a simple equation of state which generalizes a polytopic EoS as temperature varies. Using this equation, we build simple models of condensed planet's interiors including exoplanets, derive their mass-radius relationships, and study the dependence of their radius with temperature and rotation rate. We show that it depends crucially on the value of $\rho_s g R/K_s$ ($\rho_s$ being surface density, $g$ gravity, $R$ radius, $K_s$ surface incompressibility). This non-dimensional number is also the ratio of the dissipation number which appears in compressible convection and the Grune\"isen mineralogic parameter. While the radius of small planets depends on temperature, this is not the case for large planets with large dissipation numbers; Earth and a super-Earth like CoRoT-7b are in something of an intermediate state, with a moderately temperature-dependent radius. Similarly, while the radius of these two planets are functions of their rotation rates, this is not the case for smaller or larger planets.
#### Cascade Radiations of $e^\pm$ from $γγ$-annihilation process  as an extra component of the Early Optical/X-Ray Afterglows of Gamma-Ray  Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 Chromatic break and/or plateau observed in the early optical and X-ray afterglow lightcurves challenge the conventional external shock models of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Detection of TeV gamma-ray afterglows indicates strong gamma-ray production within the afterglow jets. We investigate the cascade radiations of the $e^\pm$ production via the $\gamma\gamma$ interaction in the jets. Our numerical calculations show that the cascade synchrotron emission can make a significant contribution to the early optical/X-ray afterglows. The combination of the primary and cascade emission fluxes can shape a chromatic break and/or plateau in the early optical/X-ray lightcurves, depending on the jet properties. Applying our model to GRBs 050801 and 080310, we found that their optical plateaus and the late X-ray/optical lightcurves can be explained with our model in reasonable parameter values. We suggest that such a chromatic optical plateau could be a signature of strong $e^\pm$ production in GRB afterglow jets. The TeV gamma-ray flux of such kind GRBs should be significantly reduced, hence tends to be detectable for those GRBs that have a single power-law decaying optical afterglow lightcurve.

 - **Abstract**
 The young T Tauri star PDS 70 has two gas accreting planets sharing one large gap in a pre-transitional disc. Dust continuum emission from PDS 70 c has been detected by Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 7, considered as the evidence of a circumplanetary disc, but the emission from PDS 70 b has not. We constrain the planet mass and the gas accretion rate of the planets by introducing a model of dust evolution in the CPDs and reproducing the detection and non-detection. We first develop a 1D steady gas disc model of the CPDs reflecting the planet properties. We then calculate the radial distribution of the dust profiles considering the dust evolution in the gas disc and calculate the total flux density of dust thermal emission from the CPDs. We find positive correlations between the flux density and three planet properties, the planet mass, gas accretion rate, and their product called "MMdot". We then find that the MMdot of PDS 70 c is larger than 0.4 MJ^2/Myr, and the planet mass and the gas accretion rate are larger than 5MJ and 0.02 MJ/Myr, respectively. This is the first case to succeed in obtaining constraints on planet properties from the flux density of dust continuum from a CPD. We also find some loose constraints on the properties of PDS 70 b from the non-detection. We propose possible scenarios for the planets explaining the non-detection respectively detection of the dust emission. The first explanation is that planet c has larger planet mass and/or larger gas accretion rate than planet b. The other possibility is that the CPD of planet c has a larger amount of dust supply and/or weaker turbulence than that of planet b. If the dust supply to planet c is larger than b due to its closeness to the outer dust ring, it is also quantitatively consistent with that planet c has weaker H-alpha line emission than planet b considering the dust extinction effect.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we present an analysis of the fine-tuning required in various inflationary models in order to explain the production of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). We specifically examine the degree of fine-tuning necessary in two prominent single field inflationary models: those with an inflection point and those with step-like features in the potential. Our findings indicate that models with step-like features generally require less fine-tuning compared to those with an inflection point, making them more viable for consistent PBH production. An interesting outcome of these models is that, in addition to improved fine-tuning, they may also predict low-frequency signals that can be detected by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations. Additionally, we extend our analysis to multifield inflationary models to assess whether the integration of additional fields can further alleviate the fine-tuning demands. The study also explores the role of a spectator field and its impact on the fine-tuning process. Through a comparative analysis across these models, we evaluate their parametric sensitivities and alignment with the constraints from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. Our results indicate that although mechanisms involving a spectator field can circumvent the issue of fine-tuning parameters for PBH production, both multifield models and models with step-like features present promising alternatives. While fine-tuning involves multiple considerations, our primary objective is to evaluate various inflationary models to identify the one that most naturally explains the formation of PBHs. Hence, this study aims to the development of less constrained inflationary scenarios that align with observational data and support the theoretical possibility of PBH production.

 We present the discovery of 13 new widely separated T dwarf companions to M dwarf primaries, identified using WISE/NEOWISE data by the CatWISE and Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 projects. This sample represents a $\sim$60% increase in the number of known M+T systems, and allows us to probe the most extreme products of binary/planetary system formation, a discovery space made available by the CatWISE2020 catalog and the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 effort. Highlights among the sample are WISEP J075108.79-763449.6, a previously known T9 thought to be old due to its SED, which we now find is part of a common-proper-motion pair with L 34-26 A, a well studied young M3 V star within 10 pc of the Sun; CWISE J054129.32-745021.5 B and 2MASS J05581644-4501559 B, two T8 dwarfs possibly associated with the very fast-rotating M4 V stars CWISE J054129.32-745021.5 A and 2MASS J05581644-4501559 A; and UCAC3 52-1038 B, which is among the widest late T companions to main sequence stars, with a projected separation of $\sim$7100 au. The new benchmarks presented here are prime $JWST$ targets, and can help us place strong constraints on formation and evolution theory of substellar objects as well as on atmospheric models for these cold exoplanet analogs.

 - **Abstract**
 Quintessence scalar fields are a natural candidate for evolving dark energy. Unlike the phenomenological $w_0w_a$ parameterization of the dark energy equation of state, they cannot accommodate the phantom regime of dark energy $w(z) < -1$, or crossings into the phantom regime. Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) indicate a preference for evolving dark energy over a cosmological constant, ranging from $2.6\sigma-3.9\sigma$ when fitting to $w_0w_a$, and combining the DESI BAO measurements with other cosmological probes. In this work, we directly fit three simple scalar field models to the DESI BAO data, combined with cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements and supernova data sets. Quantifying the preference for scalar field dynamics exhibited by the data, we find that $2-4\%$ of kinetic scalar field energy $\Omega_{\rm scf,k}$, is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM at the $95\%$ confidence level, for a canonical scalar field with a quadratic or linear potential. Fitting to the supernova data sets Pantheon, Pantheon+, DES-Y5, and Union3, we show that the mild tension ($n_{\sigma}< 3.4 $) under $\Lambda$CDM emerges from a BAO preference for smaller values of fractional mass-energy density $\Omega_m < 0.29$, while all supernova data sets, except for Pantheon, prefer larger values, $\Omega_m > 0.3$. The tension under $\Lambda$CDM remains noticeable ($n_{\sigma} <2.8$), when replacing two of the DESI BAO measurements redshift bins with effective redshifts $z_{\text{eff}} =0.51$, and $z_{\text{eff}}= 0.706$ with comparable BOSS DR 12 BAO measurements at $z_{\text{eff}} =0.51$, and $z_{\text{eff}}= 0.61$. Canonical scalar fields as dark energy are successful in mitigating that tension.

 - **Abstract**
 The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman), NASA's next flagship observatory, has significant mission time to be spent on surveys for general astrophysics in addition to its three core community surveys. We considered what types of observations outside the core surveys would most benefit from early definition, given 700 hours of mission time in the first two years of Roman's operation. We recommend that a survey of the Galactic plane be defined early, based on the broad range of stakeholders for such a survey, the added scientific value of a first pass to obtain a baseline for proper motions complementary to Gaia's, and the significant potential synergies with ground-based surveys, notably the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) on Rubin. We also found strong motivation to follow a community definition process for ultra-deep observations with Roman.

 - **Abstract**
 The peak photon detection efficiency (PDE) of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) can be as good or better than the PDE of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). There are experiments where the signal is measured in the presence of a strong, steady background light emission. In these, one needs to accurately evaluate the signal-to-noise ratio. Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) observe in the presence of strong noise induced by the light of the night sky. It is certainly interesting to investigate the SiPM performance under operational conditions of IACTs and to compare it with that of the PMTs. For that purpose, we built a SiPM-based detector module, which was installed in one of the imaging cameras of the two Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes in 2015. The experience gained from that module was used to design the second generation of modules of improved performance. Two such modules were installed in 2017. MAGIC is a system of two IACTs located on the Canary Island of La Palma. The mechanical structure of the MAGIC imaging cameras offers the possibility to install up to 6 additional detector modules of 7 pixels each into the open vertices of the hexagonal-shaped camera. This allows us to directly, without making any assumption, compare the performance of the PMT-based modules with that of the SiPM-based prototype modules, where SiPMs from three different manufacturers are used.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the recent years, additional low-amplitude non-radial modes were detected in many of the first-overtone RR Lyrae stars. These non-radial modes form a characteristic period ratio with the dominant first-overtone mode of around 0.61. The incidence rate of this phenomenon changes from population to population. It is also strongly dependent on the quality of the analyzed data. Current models explaining these additional signals involve non-radial modes of degrees 8 and 9. Using synthetic horizontal branch populations, we investigate the incidence rate of first-overtone RR Lyrae stars with non-radial modes depending on the population properties, i.e., ages and metallicities. We compare our results with the observed results for globular clusters and the numerous collection of field first-overtone RR Lyrae stars to test the predictions of the models. We used synthetic horizontal branches combined with pulsation models to predict how the incidence rate would depend on the age and metallicity of the population. To test whether the results based on synthetic horizontal branches are realistic, we compared them to incidence rates observed by TESS in first-overtone field RR Lyrae stars, using photometric metallicity values from a newly established calibration for TESS. The analysis of synthetic horizontal branches showed that the incidence rate decreases with decreasing metallicity. We inferred photometric metallicity for RR Lyrae stars observed by TESS and showed that the theoretical predictions are in agreement with the observations. Using the same method, we also conclude that the metallicity distribution of RR Lyrae stars showing an additional mode with a period-ratio around $0.68$ appears to be different from that of both all first-overtone stars and those showing additional non-radial modes.

 Data volumes and rates of research infrastructures will continue to increase in the upcoming years and impact how we interact with their final data products. Little of the processed data can be directly investigated and most of it will be automatically processed with as little user interaction as possible. Capturing all necessary information of such processing ensures reproducibility of the final results and generates trust in the entire process. We present PRAETOR, a software suite that enables automated generation, modelling, and analysis of provenance information of Python pipelines. Furthermore, the evaluation of the pipeline performance, based upon a user defined quality matrix in the provenance, enables the first step of machine learning processes, where such information can be fed into dedicated optimisation procedures.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been shown that a three-point correlation function of tensor perturbations from a bounce model in general relativity with a minimally-coupled scalar field is highly suppressed, and the resultant three-point function of cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarizations is too small to be detected by CMB experiments. On the other hand, bounce models in a more general class with a non-minimal derivative coupling between a scalar field and gravity can predict the three-point correlation function of the tensor perturbations without any suppression, the amplitude of which is allowed to be much larger than that in general relativity. In this paper, we evaluate the three-point function of the B-mode polarizations from the general bounce cosmology with the non-minimal coupling and show that a signal-to-noise ratio of the B-mode auto-bispectrum in the general class can reach unity for $\ell_{\rm max}\geq9$ and increase up to $5.39$ for $\ell_{\rm max}=100$ in the full-sky case. We also discuss the possibility to test the general class of bounce models by upcoming CMB experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm hyperfine line of neutral hydrogen is a useful tool to probe the conditions of the Universe during the Dark Ages, Cosmic Dawn, and the Epoch of Reionisation. In most of the current calculations, the 21-cm line signals at given frequencies are computed, using an integrated line-of-sight line opacity, with the correction for cosmological expansion. These calculations have not fully captured the line and continuum interactions in the radiative transfer, in response to evolution of the radiation field and the variations of thermal and dynamic properties of the line-of-sight medium. We construct a covariant formulation for the radiative transfer of the 21-cm line and derive the cosmological 21-cm line radiative transfer (C21LRT) equation. The formulation properly accounts for local emission and absorption processes and the interaction between the line and continuum when the radiation propagates across the expanding Universe to the present observer. Our C21LRT calculations show that methods simply summing the line optical depth could lead to error of $5\%$ in the 21-cm signals for redshift $z \sim 12-35$ and of $>10\%$ for redshift $z \lesssim 8$. Proper covariant radiative transfer is therefore necessary for producing correct theoretical templates for extracting information of the structural evolution of the Universe through the Epoch of Reionisation from the 21-cm tomographic data.
