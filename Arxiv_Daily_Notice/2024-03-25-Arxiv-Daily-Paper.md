 - **Abstract**
 Automating real-time anomaly detection is essential for identifying rare transients in the era of large-scale astronomical surveys. Modern survey telescopes are generating tens of thousands of alerts per night, and future telescopes, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, are projected to increase this number dramatically. Currently, most anomaly detection algorithms for astronomical transients rely either on hand-crafted features extracted from light curves or on features generated through unsupervised representation learning, which are then coupled with standard machine learning anomaly detection algorithms. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach to detecting anomalies: using the penultimate layer of a neural network classifier as the latent space for anomaly detection. We then propose a novel method, named Multi-Class Isolation Forests (MCIF), which trains separate isolation forests for each class to derive an anomaly score for a light curve from the latent space representation given by the classifier. This approach significantly outperforms a standard isolation forest. We also use a simpler input method for real-time transient classifiers which circumvents the need for interpolation in light curves and helps the neural network model inter-passband relationships and handle irregular sampling. Our anomaly detection pipeline identifies rare classes including kilonovae, pair-instability supernovae, and intermediate luminosity transients shortly after trigger on simulated Zwicky Transient Facility light curves. Using a sample of our simulations that matched the population of anomalies expected in nature (54 anomalies and 12,040 common transients), our method was able to discover $41\pm3$ anomalies (~75% recall) after following up the top 2000 (~15%) ranked transients. Our novel method shows that classifiers can be effectively repurposed for real-time anomaly detection.

 - **Abstract**
 The circumgalactic medium (CGM) contains information on the cumulative effect of galactic outflows over time, generally thought to be caused by feedback from star formation and active galactic nuclei. Observations of such outflows via absorption in CGM gas of quasar sightlines show a significant amount of cold ($\lesssim 10^4 \; \rm{K}$) gas which cosmological simulations struggle to reproduce. Here, we use the adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamical code RAMSES to investigate the effect of cosmic rays (CR) on the cold gas content of the CGM using three zoom realizations of a $z=1$ star-forming galaxy with supernova mechanical feedback: one with no CR feedback (referred to as no-CR), one with a medium CR diffusion coefficient $\kappa = 10^{28} \; \rm{cm^{2}\; s^{-1}}$ (CR$-\kappa_{\rm med}$), and one with a high rate of diffusion of $\kappa = 3\times10^{29} \; \rm{cm^{2}\; s^{-1}}$ (CR$-\kappa_{\rm high}$). We find that, for CR$-\kappa_{\rm med}$, the effects of CRs are largely confined to the galaxy itself as CRs do not extend far into the CGM. However, for CR$-\kappa_{\rm high}$, the CGM temperature is lowered and the amount of outflowing gas is boosted. Our CR simulations fall short of the observed Mg II covering fraction, a tracer of gas at temperatures $\lesssim 10^4 \; \rm{K}$, but the CR$-\kappa_{\rm high}$ simulation is more in agreement with covering fractions of C IV and O VI, which trace higher temperature gas.

 - **Abstract**
 We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Integral Field Spectrograph observations of NGC 3256, a local infrared-luminous late-stage merging system with two nuclei about 1 kpc apart, both of which have evidence of cold molecular outflows. Using JWST NIRSpec and MIRI datasets, we investigate this morphologically complex system on spatial scales of $<$100 pc, where we focus on the warm molecular H$_2$ gas surrounding the nuclei. We detect collimated outflowing warm H$_2$ gas originating from the southern nucleus, though we do not find significant outflowing warm H$_2$ gas surrounding the northern nucleus. Within the observed region, the maximum intrinsic velocities of the outflow reach up to $\sim$1,000 km s$^{-1}$, and extend out to a distance of 0.7 kpc. Based on H$_2$ S(7)/S(1) line ratios, we find a larger fraction of warmer gas near the S nucleus, which decreases with increasing distance from the nucleus, signifying the S nucleus as a primary source of H$_2$ heating. The gas mass of the warm H$_2$ outflow component is estimated to be $M\rm{_{warm,out}}$ = 8.9$\times$10$^5\;M_{\odot}$, as much as 4$\%$ of the cold H$_2$ mass as estimated using ALMA CO data. The outflow time scale is about $7\times10^5$ yr, resulting in a mass outflow rate of $\dot{M}\rm{_{warm,out}}$ = 1.3 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and kinetic power of $P\rm{_{warm,out}}\;\sim\;2\times10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Lastly, the regions where the outflowing gas reside show high [FeII]/Pa$\beta$ and H$_2$/Br$\gamma$ line ratios, indicating enhanced mechanical heating caused by the outflows. At the same time, the 3.3 $\mu$m and 6.2 $\mu$m Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon fluxes in these regions are not significantly suppressed compared to those outside the outflows, suggesting the outflows have no clear negative feedback effect on the local star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We build on the simplified spectral deferred corrections (SDC) coupling of hydrodynamics and reactions to handle the case of nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) and electron/positron captures/decays in the cores of massive stars. Our approach blends a traditional reaction network on the grid with a tabulated NSE state from a very large, $\mathcal{O}(100)$ nuclei, network. We demonstrate how to achieve second-order accuracy in the simplified-SDC framework when coupling NSE to hydrodynamics, with the ability to evolve the star on the hydrodynamics timestep. We discuss the application of this method to convection in massive stars leading up to core-collapse. We also show how to initialize the initial convective state from a 1D model in a self-consistent fashion. All of these developments are done in the publicly available Castro simulation code and the entire simulation methodology is fully GPU accelerated.

 - **Abstract**
 The vast majority of gravitational-wave signals from stellar-mass compact binary mergers are too weak to be individually detected with present-day instruments and instead contribute to a faint, persistent background. This astrophysical background is targeted by searches that model the gravitational-wave ensemble collectively with a small set of parameters. The traditional search models the background as a stochastic field and estimates its amplitude by cross-correlating data from multiple interferometers. A different search uses gravitational-wave templates to marginalize over all individual event parameters and measure the duty cycle and population properties of binary mergers. Both searches ultimately estimate the total merger rate of compact binaries and are expected to yield a detection in the coming years. Given the conceptual and methodological differences between them, though, it is not well understood how their results should be mutually interpreted. In this paper, we use the Fisher information to study the implications of a background detection in terms of which region of the Universe each approach probes. Specifically, we quantify how information about the compact binary merger rate is accumulated by each search as a function of the event redshift. For the LIGO Design sensitivity and a uniform-in-comoving-volume distribution of equal-mass 30M_sol binaries, the traditional cross-correlation search obtains 99% of its information from binaries up to redshift 2.5 (average signal-to-noise-ratio <8), and the template-based search from binaries up to redshift 1.0 (average signal-to-noise-ratio ~8). While we do not calculate the total information accumulated by each search, our analysis emphasizes the need to pair any claimed detection of the stochastic background with an assessment of which binaries contribute to said detection.
#### Biogenic sulfur gases as biosignatures on temperate sub-Neptune  waterworlds

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical predictions and observational data indicate a class of sub-Neptune exoplanets may have water-rich interiors covered by hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. Provided suitable climate conditions, such planets could host surface liquid oceans. Motivated by recent JWST observations of K2-18 b, we self-consistently model the photochemistry and potential detectability of biogenic sulfur gases in the atmospheres of temperate sub-Neptune waterworlds for the first time. On Earth today, organic sulfur compounds produced by marine biota are rapidly destroyed by photochemical processes before they can accumulate to significant levels. Shawn et al. (2011) suggest that detectable biogenic sulfur signatures could emerge in Archean-like atmospheres with higher biological production or low UV flux. In this study, we explore biogenic sulfur across a wide range of biological fluxes and stellar UV environments. Critically, the main photochemical sinks are absent on the nightside of tidally locked planets. To address this, we further perform experiments with a 3D GCM and a 2D photochemical model (VULCAN 2D (Tsai et al. 2024)) to simulate the global distribution of biogenic gases to investigate their terminator concentrations as seen via transmission spectroscopy. Our models indicate that biogenic sulfur gases can rise to potentially detectable levels on hydrogen-rich water worlds, but only for enhanced global biosulfur flux ($\gtrsim$20 times modern Earth's flux). We find that it is challenging to identify DMS at 3.4 $\mu m$ where it strongly overlaps with CH$_4$, whereas it is more plausible to detect DMS and companion byproducts, ethylene (C$_2$H$_4$) and ethane (C$_2$H$_6$), in the mid-infrared between 9 and 13 $\mu m$.
#### Emission Measures Demystified

 - **Abstract**
 We review the terms, spectral radiance and spectral irradiance, and show how their precise definitions are crucial for interpreting observations made with different instruments covering widely different energy or wavelength ranges. We show how the use of column and volume emission measures in different solar physics and astrophysics communities has led to confusion in relating measured extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray spectra with theoretical spectra generated, in particular, using CHIANTI. We describe a method for obtaining spatially integrated X-ray line and continuum spectra using CHIANTI that requires a column emission measure when only the plasma temperature and volume emission measure, but not the source area, are known from observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Decoding the key dynamical processes that shape the Galactic disk structure is crucial for reconstructing the Milky Way's evolution history. The second Gaia data release unveils a novel wave pattern in the $L_Z-\langle V_R\rangle$ space, but its formation mechanism remains elusive due to the intricate nature of involved perturbations and the challenges in disentangling their effects. Utilizing the latest Gaia DR3 data, we find that the $L_Z-\langle V_R\rangle$ wave systematically shifts towards lower $L_Z$ for dynamically hotter stars. The amplitude of this phase shift between stars of different dynamical hotness ($\Delta L_Z$) peaks around $\mathrm{2300\,km\,s^{-1}\,kpc}$. To differentiate the role of different perturbations, we perform three sets of test particle simulations, wherein a satellite galaxy, corotating transient spiral arms, and a bar plus the corotating transient spiral arms act as the sole perturber, respectively. Under the satellite impact, the phase shift amplitude decreases towards higher $L_Z$, which we interpret through a toy model of radial phase mixing. While the corotating transient spiral arms do not generate an azimuthally universal phase shift variation pattern, combining the bar and spirals generates a characteristic $\Delta L_Z$ peak at 2:1 Outer Lindblad Resonance, qualitatively resembling the observed feature. Therefore, the $L_Z-\langle V_R\rangle$ is more likely of internal origin. Furthermore, linking the $\Delta L_Z$ peak to the 2:1 Lindblad resonance offers a novel approach to estimating the pattern speed of the Galactic Bar, supporting the long/slow bar model.
#### Phase-resolved XMM-Newton observations of the massive post-RLOF system  HD 149404

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the X-ray emission of HD 149404, a 9.81-day period O-star binary in a post-Roche lobe overflow evolutionary stage. X-ray emission of O-star binaries consists of the intrinsic emission of the individual O stars and a putative additional component arising from the wind-wind interaction. Phase-locked variations in the X-ray spectra can be used to probe the properties of the stellar winds of such systems. XMM-Newton observations of HD 149404 collected at two conjunction phases and a quadrature phase were analysed. X-ray spectra were extracted and flux variations as a function of orbital phase were inferred. The flux ratios were analysed with models considering various origins for the X-ray emission. The highest and lowest X-ray fluxes are observed at conjunction phases respectively with the primary and secondary star in front. The flux variations are nearly grey with only marginal energy dependence. None of the models accounting for photoelectric absorption by homogeneous stellar winds perfectly reproduces the observed variations. Whilst the overall X-ray luminosity is consistent with a pure intrinsic emission, the best formal agreement with the observed variations is obtained with a model assuming pure wind-wind collision X-ray emission. The lack of significant energy-dependence of the opacity most likely hints at the presence of optically thick clumps in the winds of HD 149404.

 - **Abstract**
 Seven rotational and fine-structure transitions of the deuterated molecular ion SD+ in the X 3S- ground electronic state have been measured in the 271-863 GHz region in the laboratory. This ion has been produced by DC-glow discharge using a mixture of D2S and argon in a free space cell in a temperature range of -140 to -160C. The rotational, centrifugal distortion, spin-spin interaction, and hyperfine constants have been determined; the standard deviation of the residuals in the fitting is 109 kHz. The set of obtained spectroscopic parameters provides a list of accurate sub-millimeter rest frequencies of SD+ for astronomical detection. We have investigated lines of SD+ toward the quasar PKS 1830-211 using the ALMA archive, as the z = 0.89 molecular absorber exists in front of this quasar. A data set covering the 297 GHz region includes the N_J = 2_3-1_2 transition at 561 GHz due to redshift, providing an upper limit of the column density Ntot = 3 x 10^12 cm-2 for SD+.
#### Including a Luminous Central Remnant in Radiative Transfer Simulations  for Type Iax Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) are proposed to arise from deflagrations of Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. Previous deflagration simulations have achieved good agreement with the light curves and spectra of intermediate-luminosity and bright SNe Iax. However, the model light curves decline too quickly after peak, particularly in red optical and NIR bands. Deflagration models with a variety of ignition configurations do not fully unbind the white dwarf, leaving a remnant polluted with $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$. Emission from such a remnant may contribute to the luminosity of SNe Iax. Here we investigate the impact of adding a central energy source, assuming instantaneous powering by $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ decay in the remnant, in radiative transfer calculations of deflagration models. Including the remnant contribution improves agreement with the light curves of SNe Iax, particularly due to the slower post-maximum decline of the models. Spectroscopic agreement is also improved, with intermediate-luminosity and faint models showing greatest improvement. We adopt the full remnant $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ mass predicted for bright models, but good agreement with intermediate-luminosity and faint SNe Iax is only possible for remnant $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ masses significantly lower than those predicted. This may indicate that some of the $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ decay energy in the remnant does not contribute to the radiative luminosity but instead drives mass ejection, or that escape of energy from the remnant is significantly delayed. Future work should investigate the structure of remnants predicted by deflagration models and the potential roles of winds and delayed energy escape, as well as extend radiative transfer simulations to late times.
#### Does the Redshift Distribution of Swift Long GRBs Trace the  Star-Formation Rate?

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are extremely powerful explosions that have been traditionally classified into two categories: long bursts (LGRBs) with an observed duration T90 > 2 s, and short bursts (SGRBs) with an observed duration T90 < 2 s, where T90 is the time interval during which 90% of the fluence is detected. LGRBs are believed to emanate from the core-collapse of massive stars, while SGRBs are believed to result from the merging of two compact objects, like two neutron stars. Because LGRBs are produced by the violent death of massive stars, we expect that their redshift distribution should trace the star-formation rate (SFR). The purpose of our study is to investigate the extent to which the redshift distribution of LGRBs follows and reflects the SFR. We use a sample of 370 LGRBs taken from the Swift catalog, and we investigate different models for the LGRB redshift distribution. We also carry out Monte Carlo simulations to check the consistency of our results. Our results indicate that the SFR can describe the LGRB redshift distribution well for high redshift bursts, but it needs an evolution term to fit the distribution well at low redshift.
#### Gravitational Waves from Collapse of Pressureless Matter in the Early  Universe

 - **Abstract**
 If an early matter phase of the Universe existed after inflation with the proper power spectrum, enhanced density perturbations can decouple from the Hubble flow, turn around and collapse. In contrast to what happens in a radiation dominated Universe where pressure nullifies deviations from sphericity in these perturbations, in a matter dominated Universe, the lack of pressure although on the one hand facilitates the gravitational collapse, it allows small deviations from sphericity to grow substantially as the collapse takes place. The subsequent collapse is complicated: initially as non-spherical deviations grow, the collapsing cloud takes the form of a ``Zel'dovich pancake". After that, the more chaotic and nonlinear stage of violent relaxation begins where shells of the cloud cross and the matter is redistributed within a factor of a few of the free fall timescale, reaching a spherical virialized state. During the whole process, strong gravitational waves are emitted due to the anisotropy of the collapse and the small time interval that the effect takes place. The emission of gravitational waves during the stage of the violent relaxation cannot be easily estimated with an analytical model. We perform an $N$-body simulation to capture the behaviour of matter during this stage in order to estimate the precise spectrum of gravitational waves produced in this scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 We apply and extend standard tools for void statistics to cosmological simulations that solve Einstein's equations with numerical relativity (NR). We obtain a simulated void catalogue without Newtonian approximations, using a new watershed void finder which operates on fluid-based NR simulations produced with the Einstein Toolkit. We compare and contrast measures of void size and void fraction, and compare radial stacked density profiles to empirically-derived Hamaus-Sutter-Wandelt (HSW) density profiles and profiles based on distance to void boundaries. We recover statistics roughly consistent with Newtonian N-body simulations where such a comparison is meaningful. We study variation of dynamical spatial curvature and local expansion explicitly demonstrating the spatial fluctuations of these quantities in void regions. We find that voids in our simulations expand ~10-30% faster than the global average and the kinetic curvature density parameter in the centre of voids reaches ~60-80%. Within the limits of resolution of the simulations, the results are consistent with the parameters of the Timescape model of cosmological backreaction.

 - **Abstract**
 Giant impacts can generate transient hydrogen-rich atmospheres, reducing atmospheric carbon. The reduced carbon will form hazes that rain out onto the surface and can become incorporated into the crust. Once heated, a large fraction of the carbon would be converted into graphite. The result is that local regions of the Hadean crust were plausibly saturated with graphite. We explore the consequences of such a crust for a prebiotic surface hydrothermal vent scenario. We model a surface vent fed by nitrogen-rich volcanic gas from high-temperature magmas passing through graphite-saturated crust. We consider this occurring at pressures of 1-1000 bar and temperatures of 1500-1700 degC. The equilibrium with graphite purifies the left-over gas, resulting in substantial quantities of nitriles (0.1% HCN and 1 ppm HC3N) and isonitriles (0.01% HNC) relevant for prebiotic chemistry. We use these results to predict gas-phase concentrations of methyl isonitrile of ~ 1 ppm. Methyl isocyanide can participate in the non-enzymatic activation and ligation of the monomeric building blocks of life, and surface, or shallow, hydrothermal environments provide its only known equilibrium geochemical source.

 - **Abstract**
 This research investigates the impact of the nature of Dark Energy (DE) on structure formation, focusing on the matter power spectrum and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW). By analyzing the matter power spectrum at redshifts $z = 0$ and $z = 5$, as well as the ISW effect on the scale of $\ell = 10-100$, the study provides valuable insights into the influence of DE equations of state (EoS) on structure formation. The findings reveal that dynamical DE models exhibit a stronger matter power spectrum compared to constant DE models, with the JBP model demonstrating the highest amplitude and the CPL model the weakest. Additionally, the study delves into the ISW effect, highlighting the time evolution of the ISW source term $\mathcal{F}(a)$ and its derivative $d\mathcal{F}(a)/da$, and demonstrating that models with constant DE EoS exhibit a stronger amplitude of $\mathcal{F}(a)$ overall, while dynamical models such as CPL exhibit the highest amplitude among the dynamical models, whereas JBP has the lowest. The study also explores the ISW auto-correlation power spectrum and the ISW cross-correlation power spectrum, revealing that dynamical DE models dominate over those with constant DE EoS across various surveys. Moreover, it emphasizes the potential of studying the non-linear matter power spectrum and incorporating datasets from the small scales to further elucidate the dynamical nature of dark energy. This comprehensive analysis underscores the significance of both the matter power spectrum and the ISW signal in discerning the nature of dark energy, paving the way for future research to explore the matter power spectrum at higher redshifts and in the non-linear regime, providing deeper insights into the dynamical nature of dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 Planetesimals or smaller bodies in protoplanetary disks are often considered to form as pebble piles in current planet formation models. They are supposed to be large but loose, weakly bound clusters of more robust dust aggregates. This makes them easy prey for destructive processes. In microgravity experiments, we apply strong electric fields on clusters of slightly conductive dust aggregates. We find that this generates enough tensile stress on the fragile clusters to sequentially rip off the aggregates from the cluster. These experiments imply that electric fields in protoplanetary disks can dissolve pebble pile planetesimals. This process might induce a bias for the local planetesimal reservoir in regions with strong fields. Planetesimals prevail with certain kinds of compositions where they are either good isolators or compacted bodies. The less lucky ones generate pebble clouds which might be observable as signposts of electrostatic activity in protoplanetary disks.
#### Comparison of the disk precession models with the photometric behavior  of TT Ari in 2021-2023

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comparative analysis of photometric observations of the cataclysmic variable TT Ari in its bright state, obtained by the TESS orbital observatory in 2021 and 2023 and by ground-based amateur telescopes in 2022. The light curves from 2021 and 2022 are dominated by modulations with a period slightly shorter than the orbital one (negative superhumps), 0.13293 and 0.13273$\,$d respectively. In 2023, much stronger modulations appeared on a much longer time scale of a few days with an amplitude of up to 0.5 mag, compared to 0.2 mag in 2021. The negative superhump variability with the period of 0.13376$\,$d was also found in the first half of the 2023 observations, but then negative superhumps suddenly almost disappeared. Less significant additional modulations with a period exceeding the orbital one (positive superhumps) were detected in 2021 and 2022. Their periods were 0.15106 and 0.1523$\,$d, correspondingly. We also found a previously unnoticed periodic signal corresponding to the orbital period of 0.13755$\,$d in the TESS observations in 2021. Theoretical models of tidal precession of an elliptical disk predict a decrease in the precession period with increasing disk radius, which is consistent with the observed photometric behavior of the system. It enables us to estimate the mass ratio of the components in TT$\,$Ari to be $q\approx 0.235$. The tilted disk precession model predicts a period of nodal precession whose value is in general agreement with observations.

 Context. Euclid will carry out a deep survey benefiting the discovery and characterisation of ultracool dwarfs (UCDs), especially in the Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs), which the telescope will scan repeatedly throughout its mission. The photometric and spectroscopic standards in the EDFs are important benchmarks, crucial for the classification and characterisation of new UCD discoveries and for the calibration of the mission itself. Aims. We aim to provide a list of photometric UCD candidates and collect near-infrared reconnaissance spectra for M, L, and T-type UCDs in the EDFs as future Euclid UCD references. Methods. In EDF North, we cross-matched public optical and infrared surveys with certain photometric criteria to select UCDs. In EDF Fornax and EDF South, we used photometrically classified samples from the literature. We also include UCDs identified by Gaia DR2. We selected 7 UCD targets with different spectral types from the lists and obtained low-resolution 0.9-2.5 {\mu}m spectra of them using GTC/EMIR and the VLT/X-shooter. We also selected a young, bright L dwarf near EDF Fornax to test the coherence of these two facilities. We included an extra T dwarf in EDF North with its published J-band spectrum. Results. We retrieved a list of 92 (49, 231) M, 33 (29, 115) L, and 1 (0, 2) T dwarf candidates in EDF North, Fornax, and South, respectively. They are provided to guide future UCD discoveries and characterisations by Euclid. In total, we collected near-infrared spectra for 9 UCDs, including 2 M types, 3 L types, and 4 T types in or close to the 3 EDFs. The Euclidised spectra show consistency in their spectral classification, which demonstrates that slitless Euclid spectroscopy will recover the spectral types with high fidelity for UCDs, both in the EDFs and in the wide survey. We also demonstrate that Euclid will be able to distinguish different age groups of UCDs.

 A new generation of neutrino observatories, including RNO-G and RET, will search for PeV-EeV neutrinos interacting in the ice by detecting radio pulses. Extended air showers propagating into the ice will form an important background and could be a valuable calibration signal. We present results from a Monte-Carlo simulation framework developed to fully simulate radio emission from cosmic-ray particle cascades as observed by in-ice radio detectors in the polar regions. The framework involves a modified version of CoREAS (a module of CORSIKA 7) to simulate in-air radio emission and a GEANT4-based framework for simulating in-ice radio emission from cosmic-ray showers as observed by in-ice antennas. The particles that reach the surface of the polar ice sheet at the end of the CORSIKA 7 simulation are injected into the GEANT4-based shower simulation code that takes the particles and propagates them further into the ice sheet, using an exponential density profile for the ice. The framework takes into account curved ray paths caused by the exponential refractive index profiles of air and ice. We present the framework and discuss some key features of the radio signal and radio shower footprint for in-ice observers.

 - **Abstract**
 The theory of inflation provides an elegant explanation for the nearly flat universe observed today, which represents one of the pillars of the standard cosmological model. However, recent studies have reported some deviations from a flat geometry, arguing that a closed universe would be instead favored by observations. Given its central role played in the cosmological context, this paper revisits the issue of spatial curvature in light of the stochastic gravitational wave background signal recently detected by the NANOGrav collaboration. For this purpose, we investigate the primordial gravitational waves generated during inflation and their propagation in the post-inflationary universe. We propose a new parametrization of the gravitational wave power spectrum, taking into account spatial curvature, the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the spectral index of tensor perturbations. Therefore, we compare the theoretical predictions with NANOGrav data to possibly constrain the geometry of the universe. We find that the choice of the priors has a significant effect on the computed posterior distributions. In particular, using flat uniform priors results in $\Omega_{\mathcal{K},0}= 0.00 \pm 0.67$ at the 68\% confidence level. On the other hand, imposing a Planck prior, we obtain $\Omega_{\mathcal{K},0}= -0.05 \pm 0.17$ at the 68\% confidence level. This result aligns with the analysis of the cosmic microwave background radiation, and no deviations from a flat universe are found.
