 - **Abstract**
 As wide-field surveys yield increasingly precise data, multiprobe analyses offer significant advantages. In this work, we use our previously developed framework for jointly analyzing cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure data. We analyze combinations of three CMB (Planck PR3, Planck PR4, and ACT+WMAP) datasets, DESI Y1 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data, and a $9\times 2$pt low-$z$ dataset comprising KiDS-1000, BOSS DR12, and Planck CMB lensing/Integrated Sachs Wolfe (including all cross-correlations). We first assess internal consistency, finding a mild ($<2\sigma$) tension between CMB and low-$z$ datasets in the full parameter space and hints of systematics in Planck PR3 and KiDS-1000. We then derive constraints in $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ and, motivated by recent DESI results, dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) and free neutrino mass extensions. In $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$, we derive a novel $9\times2$pt constraint of $S8=0.777^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$ and find strong consistency among CMB datasets. In $w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$, adding low-$z$ to CMB+BAO tightens $(w_0,w_a)$ constraints by 50\% (in figure-of-merit terms) in our baseline combination of Planck PR4 + low-$z$ + BAO. The posterior accommodates a cosmological constant ($w_0 = -1, w_a = 0$) within $1\sigma$, in contrast to the $\sim2\sigma$ preference for evolving dark energy from CMB+BAO alone. For neutrino masses, our baseline dataset yields a systematics-robust constraint of $M_\nu<0.12\mathrm{eV}$ in $\nu\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$. Allowing dynamical dark energy and free neutrino mass ($\nu w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) broadens and shifts the neutrino mass posterior higher, yielding a $1.8\sigma$ constraint ($M_\nu=0.16^{+0.09}_{-0.09}\mathrm{eV}$) in our baseline. Our analysis demonstrates the power of multiprobe analyses for assessing tensions, identifying systematics and providing robust constraints.

          The Dynamical History of the Kepler-221 Planet System

 - **Abstract**
 Kepler-221 is a G-type star hosting four planets. In this system, planets b, c, and e are in (or near) a 6:3:1 three-body resonance even though the planets' period ratios show significant departures from exact two-body commensurability. Importantly, the intermediate planet d is not part of the resonance chain. To reach this resonance configuration, we propose a scenario in which there were originally five planets in the system in a chain of first-order resonances. After disk dispersal, the resonance chain became unstable and two planets quickly merged to become the current planet d. In addition, the b/c/e three-body resonance was re-established. We run N-body simulations using REBOUND to investigate the parameter space under which this scenario can operate. We find that our envisioned scenario is possible when certain conditions are met. First, the reformation of the three-body resonance after planet merging requires convergent migration between planets b and c. Second, as has previously pointed out, an efficient damping mechanism must operate to power the expansion of the b/c/e system. We find that planet d plays a crucial role during the orbital expansion phase due to destabilizing encounters of a three-body resonance between c, d, and e. A successful orbital expansion phase puts constraints on the planet properties in the Kepler-221 system including the planet mass ratios and the tidal quality factors for the planets. Our model can also be applied to other planet systems in resonance, such as Kepler-402 and K2-138.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroid discoveries are essential for planetary-defense efforts aiming to prevent impacts with Earth, including the more frequent megaton explosions from decameter impactors. While large asteroids ($\geq$100 km) have remained in the main belt since their formation, small asteroids are commonly transported to the near-Earth object (NEO) population. However, due to the lack of direct observational constraints, their size-frequency distribution--which informs our understanding of the NEOs and the delivery of meteorite samples to Earth--varies significantly among models. Here, we report 138 detections of the smallest asteroids ($\gtrapprox $10 m) ever observed in the main belt, which were enabled by JWST's infrared capabilities covering the asteroids' emission peaks and synthetic tracking techniques. Despite small orbital arcs, we constrain the objects' distances and phase angles using known asteroids as proxies, allowing us to derive sizes via radiometric techniques. Their size-frequency distribution exhibits a break at ${\sim}100$ m (debiased cumulative slopes of $q = -2.66\pm0.60$ and $-0.97\pm0.14$ for diameters smaller and larger than $\sim $100 m, respectively), suggestive of a population driven by collisional cascade. These asteroids were sampled from multiple asteroid families--most likely Nysa, Polana and Massalia--according to the geometry of pointings considered here. Through additional long-stare infrared observations, JWST is poised to serendipitously detect thousands of decameter-scale asteroids across the sky, probing individual asteroid families and the source regions of meteorites "in-situ".

          $Lux$: A generative, multi-output, latent-variable model for astronomical data with noisy labels

 - **Abstract**
 The large volume of spectroscopic data available now and from near-future surveys will enable high-dimensional measurements of stellar parameters and properties. Current methods for determining stellar labels from spectra use physics-driven models, which are computationally expensive and have limitations in their accuracy due to simplifications. While machine learning methods provide efficient paths toward emulating physics-based pipelines, they often do not properly account for uncertainties and have complex model structure, both of which can lead to biases and inaccurate label inference. Here we present $Lux$: a data-driven framework for modeling stellar spectra and labels that addresses prior limitations. $Lux$ is a generative, multi-output, latent variable model framework built on JAX for computational efficiency and flexibility. As a generative model, $Lux$ properly accounts for uncertainties and missing data in the input stellar labels and spectral data and can either be used in probabilistic or discriminative settings. Here, we present several examples of how $Lux$ can successfully emulate methods for precise stellar label determinations for stars ranging in stellar type and signal-to-noise from the $APOGEE$ surveys. We also show how a simple $Lux$ model is successful at performing label transfer between the $APOGEE$ and $GALAH$ surveys. $Lux$ is a powerful new framework for the analysis of large-scale spectroscopic survey data. Its ability to handle uncertainties while maintaining high precision makes it particularly valuable for stellar survey label inference and cross-survey analysis, and the flexible model structure allows for easy extension to other data types.

          Resolving the Super-Earth/Gas Giant Connection in Stellar Mass and Metallicity

 - **Abstract**
 The observed correlation between inner super-Earths and outer gas giants places strong constraints on formation theories. Building on previous work, Bryan $\&$ Lee 2024 showed that there is a statistically significant positive correlation between super-Earths and outer gas giants around metal-rich FGK stars, and that this correlation disappears for metal-poor hosts. Here we consider how this connection evolves across stellar mass. Starting with our sample of 85 M-dwarfs ($<$0.6 M$_{\odot}$) hosting inner super-Earths, we calculate P(GG|SE, [Fe/H]$>$0) = 9.4 (+10.2 -3.1)$\%$ and P(GG|SE, [Fe/H]$\leq$0)$<$3.1$\%$. Compared to the field gas giant frequency calculated from the Rosenthal et al 2021 sample, we find P(GG|[Fe/H]$>$0) = 10.3 (+6.9 -3.1)$\%$, and P(GG|[Fe/H]$\leq$0)$<$2.6$\%$ for M-dwarfs. While we see a higher gas giant frequency around metal-rich M-dwarfs for both samples, we find no significant correlations between super-Earths and gas giants. Combining our 85 M-dwarf sample with our FGK sample from Bryan $\&$ Lee 2024, we resolve the SE/GG correlation in stellar mass (0.3--1.5 M$_{\odot}$) and metallicity. We show the positive correlation emerges in metal-rich K-dwarfs and strengthens with increasing stellar mass. Gas giant properties also impact the correlation -- for metal rich stars, the positive correlation is strengthened by: 1) dynamically hot gas giants for all stellar masses; 2) distant gas giants only for higher mass stars; and 3) single gas giants for K-dwarfs and multiple gas giants around more massive stars. We discuss how the stellar mass dependence of the inner-outer planet correlation can be understood from the increasing disk mass budget for higher mass stars.

          Clustered unified dark sector cosmology: Background evolution and linear perturbations in light of observations

 - **Abstract**
 We consider unified dark sector models in which the fluid can collapse and cluster into halos, allowing for hierarchical structure formation to proceed as in standard cosmology. We show that both background evolution and linear perturbations tend towards those in $\LCDM$ as the clustered fraction $f \rightarrow 1$. We confront such models with various observational datasets, with emphasis on the relatively well motivated standard Chaplygin gas. We show that the strongest constraints come from secondary anisotropies in the CMB spectrum, which prefer models with $f \rightarrow 1$. However, as a larger Hubble constant is allowed for smaller $f$, values of $f \simeq 0.99$ (rather than tending to exact unity) are favored when late universe expansion data is included, with $f \simeq 0.97$ and $H_0 \simeq 70 {\rm km/s/Mpc}$ allowed at the 2-$\sigma$ level. Such values of $f$ imply extremely efficient clustering into nonlinear structures. They may nevertheless be compatible with clustered fractions in warm dark matter based cosmologies, which have similar minimal halo mass scales as the models considered here. Tight CMB constraints on $f$ also apply to the generalized Chaplygin gas, except for models that are already quite close to $\LCDM$, in which case all values of $0 \le f \le 1$ are allowed. In contrast to the CMB, large scale structure data, which were initially used to rule out unclustered unified dark matter models, are far less constraining. Indeed, late universe data, including the large scale galaxy distribution, prefer models that are far from $\LCDM$. But these are in tension with the CMB data.

          Polydisperse Formation of Planetesimals: The dust size distribution in clumps

 - **Abstract**
 The streaming instability is an efficient method for overcoming the barriers to planet formation in protoplanetary discs. The streaming instability has been extensively modelled by hydrodynamic simulations of gas and a single dust size. However, more recent studies considering a more realistic case of a particle size distribution show that this will significantly decrease the growth rate of the instability. We follow up on these studies by evaluating the polydisperse streaming instability, looking at the non-linear phase of the instability at the highest density regions, and investigating the dust size distribution in the densest dust structures. We employ 2D hydrodynamic simulations in an unstratified shearing box with multiple dust species representing an underlying continuous dust size spectrum using FARGO3D. To calculate the drag force on the gas due to a continuous dust size distribution, we apply the Gauss-Legendre quadrature method in dust size space. This method converges faster with the number of dust species than the usual uniform sampling method. The polydisperse streaming instability is less efficient than its monodisperse counterpart in generating dense clumps that could collapse into planetesimals. In the densest dust structure, the larger dust sizes are more abundant because they are less coupled to the gas and, therefore, can clump together more than the smaller dust grains. This trend is broken at the largest dust size due to size-dependent spatial segregation of the highest-density regions, where particles with the largest Stokes numbers are located just outside the densest areas of the combined dust species. This is observed as a peak in the size distribution at the densest regions, which could relate to the size distribution that ends up in the planetesimal after collapse and can mimic the size distribution of dust growth.

          Impact of phase signal formulations on tilt-to-length coupling noise in the LISA test mass interferometer

 - **Abstract**
 Tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can generate spurious displacement noise that potentially affects the measurement of gravitational wave signals. In each test mass interferometer, the coupling of misalignments with spacecraft angular jitter produces noise in the longitudinal pathlength signal. This signal comes from the phase readout combinations of an interfering measurement beam and a local reference beam at a quadrant photodetector, but various formulations exist for its calculation. Selection of this pathlength signal formulation affects the TTL coupling noise. We therefore simulated two pathlength signal candidates, the complex sum and the averaged phase, and evaluated their performance in the LISA test mass interferometer under the assumption of static alignment imperfections. All simulations were performed using three different methods with cross-checked results. We find with all three methods that the averaged phase is the choice with equal or less TTL coupling noise in four out of the five test cases. Finally, we show that the non-linear TTL contributions in the test mass interferometer to be negligible in all our test-cases, no matter which formulation of pathlength signal is chosen.

 - **Abstract**
 The Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) is a series of upgrades for the Keck II Adaptive Optics (AO) system and the NIRSPEC spectrograph to enable diffraction limited, high resolution (R>30000) spectroscopy of exoplanets and low mass companions in the K and L bands. Phase I consisted of single mode fiber injection/extraction units (FIU/FEU) used in conjunction with a H band pyramid wavefront sensor. The use of single mode fibers provides a gain in stellar rejection, a substantial reduction in sky background, and an extremely stable line spread function in the spectrograph. Phase II, deployed and commissioned in 2022, brought a 1000 actuator deformable mirror, beam shaping optics, a vortex mask, and other upgrades to the FIU/FEU. An additional service mission in 2024 extended operations down to y band, delivered an atmospheric dispersion corrector, and provided access to two laser frequency combs. KPIC phase II brings higher planet throughput, lower stellar leakage and many new observing modes which extend its ability to characterize exoplanets at high spectral resolution, building on the success of phase I. In this paper we present a description of the final phase II version of KPIC, along with results of system level laboratory testing and characterization showing the instrument's phase II throughput, stability, repeatability, and other key performance metrics prior to delivery and during installation at Keck. We outlined the capabilities of the various observing modes enabled by the new modules as well as efforts to compensate for static aberrations and non common path errors at Keck, which were issues that plagued phase I. Finally, we show results from commissioning.

 - **Abstract**
 The WISPR imager on Parker Solar Probe provides a unique view the young solar wind, flying through solar wind structures at high speed. It is of interest to use WISPR image sequences to measure the velocity of both large features (such as CMEs) and the background, ambient wind. However, WISPR's close-up, rapidly-moving perspective makes the usual methods for measuring velocities from images difficult or impossible to apply, as most apparent motion through the image is due to the motion or rotation of the imager. In this work, we propose a new method of looking for features at the "stationary point" -- a direction from which some plasma parcels appear to approach the spacecraft, remaining at a constant direction in the image sequence. This direction is a function of the plasma's radial velocity, the encounter geometry, and the spacecraft velocity, allowing the former two to be inferred. We demonstrate the technique with forward-modeled images, and we apply it to WISPR observations, inferring the speed and trajectory of a particular density feature. This method promises to enable speed measurements of the young solar wind in an important acceleration region, from a close-up perspective and at latitudes well outside the PSP orbital plane. And while we present this method in a solar wind context, it is broadly applicable to any situation of a moving viewpoint traveling through an expanding cloud of features.

          Turbulent gas-rich discs at high redshift: origin of thick stellar discs through 3D 'baryon sloshing'

 - **Abstract**
 In response to recent observations from JWST and ALMA, we explore a new class of dynamically self-consistent models using our AGAMA/Ramses hydrodynamic N-body framework (Nexus) that mimics a plausible progenitor of the Milky Way over a wide range of disc gas fractions ($f_{\rm gas} = 0-100\%$). The high gas surface densities encourage vigorous star formation, which in turn couples with the gas to drive turbulence. We show that this coupling through momentum recoil drives 'baryon sloshing,' i.e. a random walk of the baryonic potential minimum with respect to the centre of the total gravitational potential, $\Phi_{\rm tot}$. The amplitude of the bulk motion depends on the strength of the feedback, which in turn is directly associated with $f_{\rm gas}$. At its most extreme, when gas is the sole contributor to the disc potential ($f_{\rm gas}=100$%), the amplitude of the walk can reach up to $R\approx 5$ kpc and $\vert z\vert \approx 1$ kpc within $\Phi_{\rm tot}(R,\phi,z)$. Consistent with observations, the disc dominates over dark matter ($f_{\rm disc}\gtrsim 50$%) within $R_s=2.2 R_{\rm disc}$, where $R_{\rm disc}$ is the exponential disc scale length. For a lower $f_{\rm disc}$ and/or $f_{\rm gas}$, the 3D sloshing amplitude and velocity are reduced. The combination of strong feedback (which unbinds the disc) and sloshing leads to the newly formed stars being dynamically heated and settling to a more spatially extended disc population. The 3D heating process is isotropic but its effects are more noticeable in $\vert z\vert$ due to the initial dynamical coldness of the star-forming disc. Such a disc has enhanced [$\alpha$/Fe] stellar abundances and a vertical (but no radial) gradient in stellar age and metallicity, both consistent with the Milky Way's thick stellar disc. Contrary to earlier claims, star formation in a stationary turbulent disc does $not$ produce thick stellar discs.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar oscillations and granulation in red giants are both powered by convection. Studying the wavelength dependence of their amplitudes can provide useful insights on the driving mechanism. It is also important for plans to carry out asteroseismology with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which will operate in the near infrared, to check the dependence of oscillations and granulation on the observational wavelength. In this work, we aim to understand how the oscillation and granulation power in red giants depend on the wavelength and study how existing predictions compare with observations. We measure the mean oscillation and granulation power of 279 Kepler red giants, from the power density spectra derived using Kepler PDCSAP and TESS-SPOC light curves. We find that selection of light curves is important for the study of amplitudes, since different light curve products from TESS show different values of amplitudes. We show that the oscillation and granulation power ratios between TESS and Kepler match the theoretical prediction, confirming that both decrease as we move to redder wavelengths. We also see that the mean ratios of oscillations and granulation agree, suggesting that oscillation and granulation have the same wavelength dependence. We also find that the mean height-to-background ratio for Kepler agrees with previous results and shows good agreement with TESS. These results suggest that the granulation signals would not severely affect the detection of oscillations. We checked the dependence of these ratio between Kepler and TESS on stellar parameters, and see no trends.

 - **Abstract**
 We present fundamental atmospheric parameters (Teff and log g) and metallicities ([M/H]) for 507,513 M dwarf stars using low-resolution spectra (R~1800) from LAMOST DR10. By employing Cycle-StarNet, an innovative domain adaptation approach, we successfully bridge the gap between theoretical PHOENIX synthetic spectra and observed LAMOST spectra, enabling parameter measurements even for lower signal-to-noise data (S/N>5). The fitting residual analysis shows a reduction from 2.0 times to 1.68 times the flux uncertainty. Comparing with available literature values, we find systematic offsets and precisions of 12$\pm$70 K in Teff, -0.04$\pm$0.17 dex in log g, and -0.06$\pm$0.20 dex in [M/H]. The precision improves for higher quality spectra (S/N>50) to 47 K, 0.12 dex, and 0.14 dex respectively. The metallicity consistency between wide binaries shows a scatter of 0.24 dex, improving to 0.15 dex at S/N>50. We provide a comprehensive catalog including stellar parameters, spectral classifications, activity indicators, and binary/variability flags, establishing a resource for studies of the most numerous stellar population.

 Using open astronomical multifrequency databases, we constructed light curves and developed a comprehensive visualisation and sonification analysis for the blazars Mrk~501, Mrk~1501, Mrk~421, BL~Lacerta, AO~0235+164, 3C~66A, OJ~049, OJ~287, and PKS~J2134-0153. This study employed Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) and Parameter Mapping Sonification (PMSon) techniques to generate waveforms, spectrograms, and sonifications. These representations demonstrate that data visualisation and sonification are powerful tools for analysing astronomical objects like blazers, providing insights into their multifrequency variability. This work highlights how sonification and visualisation can aid in identifying potential patterns, power variations, regularities, and gaps in the data. This multimodal approach also underscores the importance of inclusivity in scientific communication, offering accessible methods for exploring the complex behaviour of blazers.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a search for the diffuse extremely-high-energy neutrino flux using $12.6$ years of IceCube data. The non-observation of neutrinos with energies well above $10 \, \mathrm{PeV}$ constrains the all-flavor neutrino flux at $10^{18} \, \mathrm{eV}$ to a level of $E^2 \Phi_{\nu_e + \nu_\mu + \nu_\tau} \simeq 10^{-8} \, \mathrm{GeV} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} \, \mathrm{sr}^{-1}$, the most stringent limit to date. Using this data, we constrain the proton fraction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) above $\simeq 30 \, \mathrm{EeV}$ to be $\lesssim 70\,$% (at $90\,$% CL) if the cosmological evolution of the sources is comparable to or stronger than the star formation rate. This result complements direct air-shower measurements by being insensitive to uncertainties associated with hadronic interaction models. It is the first such result to disfavor the ``proton-only" hypothesis for UHECRs using neutrino data.

 - **Abstract**
 PSR B1310+18A is a 33-ms binary pulsar in a 256-day, low eccentricity orbit with a low-mass companion located in NGC 5024 (M53). In this Letter, we present the first phase-coherent timing solution for this pulsar (designated as M53A) derived from a 35-year timing baseline; this combines the archival Arecibo Observatory data with the recent observations from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). We find that the spin period derivative of the pulsar is between 6.1 and $7.5 \times 10^{-19} \rm \, s\, s^{-1}$, which implies a characteristic age between 0.70 and 0.85 Gyr. The timing solution also includes a precise position and proper motion for the pulsar, enabling the identification of the companion of M53A in Hubble Space Telescope data as a Helium white dwarf (He WD) with a mass of $M_{\rm WD}=0.39^{+0.05}_{-0.07} \, \rm M_{\odot}$ and a cooling age of $0.14^{+0.04}_{-0.03}\, \rm Gyr$, confirming that the system formed recently in the history of the GC. The system resembles, in its spin and orbital characteristics, similarly wide pulsar - He WD systems in the Galactic disk. We conclude by discussing the origin of slow pulsars in globular clusters, showing that none of the slow pulsars in low-density globular clusters are as young as the systems observed in the densest known globular clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 The camera of the Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) consists of 1855 pixels that are grouped into 265 high-performance photomultiplier tube (PMT) modules. Each module comprises a seven-light-guide plate, seven PMT units, a slow control board, and a readout board with a trigger board. %In this paper we describe The requirements for the PMT modules include various aspects, such as photon detection efficiency, dynamic range, buffer depth, and test pulse functionality. We have developed a high-performance PMT module that fulfills all these requirements. Mass-production and quality control (QC) of modules for all four LSTs of the northern CTAO have been completed. Here we report on the technical details of each element of the module and its performance, together with the methods and results of QC measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first spectro-polarimetric study of the bright atoll source GX 9+1, using the simultaneous Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), and Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) observations. The source was observed to remain in the soft state, with no changes in state throughout the observation period. The source does not show significant polarization in the 2-8 keV energy range. However, a significant polarization (3.3 sigma) was detected in the 2-3 keV range, with a polarization degree of 3.3 +/- 0.8% and a polarization angle of 11 +/- 7 deg. We used the simultaneous energy spectra from NICER (0.6 - 11 keV) and IXPE (2-8 keV) to study the spectral properties of the source during observations. The observed spectrum of the source can be well described by a combination of Comptonized blackbody emission from the neutron star surface (compbb model in XSPEC) and thermal Comptonized component with seed photons from the accretion disc. The spectral properties of GX 9+1 during the observation are consistent with those of other bright atoll-sources in the soft state. However, the high polarization degree observed in the low-energy band does not align with previous IXPE observations of other atoll-sources. This observed polarization in the source is attributed to the strong polarization of the Comptonized blackbody component. We discuss the results from the spectro-polarimetric studies in the context of various accretion disc and coronal geometries of the source.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The localized formation of planetesimals can be triggered with the help of streaming instability when the local pebble density is high. This can happen at various locations in the disk leading to the formation of local planetesimal rings. The planetesimals in these rings subsequently grow from mutual collisions and by pebble accretion. Aims. We investigate the early growth of protoplanetary embryos from a ring of planetesimals created from streaming instability to see if they reach sizes where they accrete pebbles efficiently. Methods. We simulate the early stages of planet formation for rings of planetesimals that we assume were created by streaming instability at various separations from the star and for various stellar masses using a semi-analytic model. Results. The rings in the inner disk are able to produce protoplanetary embryos in a short time whereas at large separations there is little to no growth. The growth of the largest bodies is significantly slower around lower-mass stars. Conclusions. The formation of planetary embryos from filaments during the disk lifetime is possible but strongly dependent on the separation from the star and the mass of the host star. It remains difficult to form the seeds of pebble accretion early in the outer disk \sim 50AU, especially for low-mass stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of PSR J0031$-$5726 in the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA eXtended imaging survey at a Galactic latitude of $b \approx -60^\circ$. The pulsar exhibits both sporadic, extremely bright pulses reminiscent of rotating radio transients (RRATs) as well as a persistent, dimmer pulses. The bright pulses tend to arrive at later rotation phases than their dimmer counterparts, and have dramatically varying polarization angle curves, such that the integrated profile appears almost completely depolarized down to the system noise level. The rotation measure of individual pulses was found to sometimes vary by up to ${\sim}0.8\,$rad/m$^2$, but was otherwise generally consistent with its average (ionosphere-corrected) value of $10.0 \pm 0.1\,$rad/m$^2$. We surmise that J0031$-$5726 may represent a class of pulsar that is intermediate between normal pulsars and RRATs.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Binary systems can be born surrounded by circumbinary discs. The gaseous discs surrounding either of the two stellar companions can have their life extended by the supply of mass arriving from the circumbinary disc. Aims. The objective of this study is to investigate the gravitational interactions exerted by a compact and eccentric binary system on the circumbinary and circumprimary discs, and the resulting transport of gas and solids between the disc components. Methods. We assume that the gas in the system behaves as a fluid and model its evolution by means of high resolution hydrodynamical simulations. Dust grains are modeled as Lagrangian particles that interact with the gas and the stars. Results. Models indicate that significant fluxes of gas and dust proceed from the circumbinary disc toward the circumprimary disc. For the applied system parameters, grains of certain sizes are segregated outside the tidal gap generated by the stars. Consequently, the size distribution of the transported dust is not continuous but it presents a gap in the mm size range. In close binaries, the lifetime of an isolated circumprimary disc is found to be short, approximately 10 5 years, because of its small mass. However, because of the influx of gas from beyond the tidal gap, the disc around the primary star can survive much longer, about 10 6 years, as long as gas accretion from the circumbinary disc continues. The supply of solids and the extended lifetime of a circumbinary disc also aids in the possible formation of giant planets. Compared to close binary systems without a circumbinary disc, we expect a higher frequency of single- or multiple- planet systems. Additionally, a planetesimal or debris belt can form in proximity of the truncation radius of the circumprimary disc and/or around the location of the exterior edge of the tidal gap.

 - **Abstract**
 We use Gaia DR3 astrometry and photometry to analyze the spatial distribution of the young stellar populations and stellar clusters and to search for new OB star candidates in the Carina Nebula complex and the full extent of the Car OB1 association. We first performed a new census of high-mass stars in Car OB1 and compiled a comprehensive catalog of 517 stars with known spectral types that have Gaia DR3 parallaxes consistent with membership in the association. We applied the clustering algorithm DBSCAN on the Gaia data of the region to find stellar clusters, determine their distances and kinematics, and estimate ages. We also used Gaia astrometry and the additional astrophysical_parameters table to perform a spatially unbiased search for further high-mass members of Car OB1 over the full area of the association. Our DBSCAN analysis finds 15 stellar clusters and groups in Car OB1, four of which were not known before. Most clusters (80%) show signs of expansion or contraction, four of them with a >2$\sigma$ significance. We find a global expansion of the Car OB1 association and a kinematic traceback of the high-mass stars shows that the spatial extent of the association was at a minimum 3-4 Myr ago. Using astrophysical parameters by Gaia DR3, we identified 15 new O-type and 589 new B-type star candidates in Car OB1. The majority (>54%) of the high-mass stars constitute a non-clustered distributed stellar population. Based on our sample of high-mass stars, we estimate a total stellar population of at least ~8*10^4 stars in Car OB1. Our study is the first systematic astrometric analysis that covers the full spatial extent of the Car OB1 association, and it therefore substantially increases the knowledge of the distributed stellar population and spatial evolution of the entire association. Our results suggest suggests Car OB1 to be the most massive known star-forming complex in our Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Our understanding of exoplanet demographics partly depends on their corresponding host star parameters. With the majority of exoplanet-host stars having only atmospheric constraints available, robust inference of their parameters is susceptible to the approach used. The goal of this work is to develop a grid-based machine learning tool capable of determining the stellar radius, mass, and age using only atmospheric constraints and to analyse the age distribution of stars hosting giant planets. Our machine learning approach involves combining four tree-based machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Extra Trees, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and CatBoost) trained on a grid of stellar models to infer stellar radius, mass, and age using Teff, [Fe/H], and luminosities. We perform a detailed statistical analysis to compare the inferences of our tool with those based on seismic data from the APOKASC and LEGACY samples. Finally, we apply our tool to determine the ages of stars hosting giant planets. Comparing the stellar parameter inferences from our machine learning tool with those from the APOKASC and LEGACY, we find a bias (and a scatter) of -0.5\% (5\%) and -0.2\% (2\%) in radius, 6\% (5\%) per cent and -2\% (3\%) in mass, and -9\% (16\%) and 7\% (23\%) in age, respectively. Therefore, our machine learning predictions are commensurate with seismic inferences. When applying our model to a sample of stars hosting Jupiter-mass planets, we find the average age estimates for the hosts of Hot Jupiters, Warm Jupiters, and Cold Jupiters to be 1.98, 2.98, and 3.51 Gyr, respectively. These statistical ages of the host stars confirm previous predictions - based on stellar model ages for a relatively small number of hosts, as well as on the average age-velocity dispersion relation - that stars hosting Hot Jupiters are statistically younger than those hosting Warm and Cold Jupiters.

 - **Abstract**
 To search for and study the instabilities in the atmospheres of selected post-AGB stars, we have performed a long-term high-resolution spectroscopy (R=60000) with the spectrograph NES of the 6-meter BTA telescope. Low-amplitude pulsations, splitting and/or asymmetry of the absorption profiles with a low excitation potential, as well as variability of a complex H$\alpha$ profile have been registered in the optical spectra of single stars associated with the IR sources IRASz02229+6208, IRAS 04296+3429, IRAS 07134+1005, IRAS 07430+1115, IRAS 19500-1709, IRAS 22223+4327, and IRAS 23304+6147 that had previously undergone the 3-d dredge-up. The maximum pulsation amplitude A$_{\rm Vr}$ was detected for the stars in the IRAS 07134+1005 and IRAS 19500-1709 systems, which have the maximum temperatures among the stars studied. Stratification of radial velocity in the atmosphere was found for two stars in the sample. The luminosity of the studied stars was estimated based on the intensity of the IR oxygen triplet OI(7774). Moreover, a luminosity of log${\rm (L/L_{\odot})}\approx$3.1 was obtained for the star in the IRAS 07430+1115 system within the typical values for post-AGB stars luminosity, which eliminates the paradox of the luminosity and the initial mass of this object.

 In tomographic cosmic-shear observations, the BNT (Bernardeau, Nishimichi, Taruya) transform, Bernardeau et al. (2014), allows to build weak lensing transformed maps for which the contribution from low redshift lenses is nulled. As this transformation depends specifically on the expansion rate of the Universe but is independent of the matter distribution properties, it can be leveraged to extract information from large-scale structure probes at arbitrary non-linear scales, providing constraints on cosmological background evolution. We demonstrate this by proposing a specific null test for stage IV weak lensing projects. Using a Fisher matrix analysis and parameter sampling, we show that this approach can substantially enhance constraints on the dark energy equation of state. Notably, we find that shape noise currently limits this method's effectiveness making significant improvement possible in future designs. A detailed analysis of our null test in the context of the Euclid mission is presented in a companion paper Touzeau et al. (2025).

 - **Abstract**
 The article "Confirmation of interstellar phosphine towards asymptotic giant branch star IRC+10216" by A. Manna and S. Pal uses ALMA data of the C-star envelope IRC+10216 to claim a confirmation of the detection of PH3 in this source. The article however incorrectly assign an emission feature observed in the ALMA spectrum of IRC+10216 to PH3, while we find that it arises from a highly vibrationally excited state of HCN. Concretely the feature can be confidently assigned to the J=3-2 l=0 transition of HCN in the v1+4v2 vibrational state based on the observation of the l=+2 and l=-2 components of the same rotational transition, J=3-2, with the observed relative intensities in agreement with the relative line strengths. The detection of PH3 in IRC+10216 remains confirmed based on the observation of the J=1-0 and J=2-1 lines with the single-dish telescopes IRAM-30m, ARO SMT-10m, and Herschel (Agundez et al. 2008, 2014; Tenenbaum et al. 2008).

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel mechanism of primordial black hole (PBH) formation through inverted bubble collapse. In this scenario, bubbles nucleate sparsely in an incomplete first-order phase transition, followed by a bulk phase transition in the rest of the universe that inverts these pre-existing bubbles into false vacuum regions. These spherically symmetric false-vacuum bubbles subsequently collapse to form PBHs. Unlike conventional PBH formation mechanisms associated with domain wall collapse or bubble coalescence, our inverted bubble collapse mechanism naturally ensures spherical collapse. We demonstrate that, when applied to the electroweak phase transition, this mechanism can produce highly monochromatic PBHs with masses up to ${\cal O}(10^{-6}\,\text{-}\,10^{-5}) M_\odot$, which potentially explain the microlensing events observed in the OGLE and Subaru HSC data.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrodynamical simulations are the most accurate way to model structure formation in the universe, but they often involve a large number of astrophysical parameters modeling subgrid physics, in addition to cosmological parameters. This results in a high-dimensional space that is difficult to jointly constrain using traditional statistical methods due to prohibitive computational costs. To address this, we present a fully differentiable approach for cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and a proof-of-concept implementation, diffhydro. By back-propagating through an upwind finite volume scheme for solving the Euler Equations jointly with a dark matter particle-mesh method for Poisson equation, we are able to efficiently evaluate derivatives of the output baryonic fields with respect to input density and model parameters. Importantly, we demonstrate how to differentiate through stochastically sampled discrete random variables, which frequently appear in subgrid models. We use this framework to rapidly sample sub-grid physics and cosmological parameters as well as perform field level inference of initial conditions using high dimensional optimization techniques. Our code is implemented in JAX (python), allowing easy code development and GPU acceleration.

 - **Abstract**
 To model the structure of neutron stars (NSs) theoretically,it is common to consider layers with different density regimes. Matching the equation of state (EoS) for the crust and core and obtaining a suitable description of these extreme conditions are crucial for understanding the properties of these compact objects. In this work, we construct ten different NS EoSs incorporating three distinct crust models, which are connected to the core using a thermodynamically and causally consistent formalism. For cold NSs, we propose a linear relationship between pressure and energy density in a narrow region between the crust and core, effectively establishing an interpolation function in the pressure-baryonic chemical potential plane. We then compare this EoS matching method with the classical approach, which neglects causal and thermodynamic consistency. We solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation to obtain the mass-radius relationship and compare our results with observational constraints on NSs. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of the new matching formalism on non-radial oscillation frequencies and damping times. Our findings suggest that the method used to glue the crust and core EoS impacts NS observables, such as the radius, oscillation frequencies, and damping times of non-radial modes, which may be crucial for interpreting future gravitational wave observations from neutron star mergers or isolated pulsars. The effects are particularly noticeable for low-mass NSs, regardless of the specific EoS model chosen. In particular, we find that the $p_1$ oscillation mode exhibits significant differences in frequencies among alternative matching methods, whereas the fundamental $f$-mode remains unaffected by changes in crust models or interpolation schemes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present synthetic optical light curves of the hierarchical HD98800 quadruple system over a decade-long period when the circumbinary disc encircling the system's B binary is expected to eclipse the light from the A binary. We produce and compare light curves of this transit event using hydrodynamical models with different values of the disc's gas mass, dust mass, and $\alpha$-viscosity to determine the observable effect of each parameter. These comparisons provide insight that could aid in the analysis of observational data from the system when the real transit occurs and provide recommendations for how such observations should be made. We find that a higher dust mass or higher value of $\alpha$ correspond to a longer transit, with the gas mass having a more minor effect on the overall shape and duration of the transit. A higher $\alpha$ has an observable effect on the viscous spreading at the outer edge of the disc, though is countered through truncation by the outer binary. It is also shown that long-term interactions between the outer binary and disc can excite spiral arms in the disc, which introduce observable asymmetries to the light curve. Our models suggest that the transit should have begun at the time of writing, but no dimming has yet been observed. It is likely that the disc has a smaller radial extent than our models, due to a lower viscosity than can be simulated with SPH. The transit is expected to last 8-11 years, ending in late 2034 at the latest.

 - **Abstract**
 Diffuse photons of energy above 0.1 PeV, produced through the interactions between cosmic rays and either interstellar matter or background radiation fields, are powerful tracers of the distribution of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. Furthermore, the measurement of a diffuse photon flux would be an important probe to test models of super-heavy dark matter decaying into gamma-rays. In this work, we search for a diffuse photon flux in the energy range between 50 PeV and 200 PeV using data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. For the first time, we combine the air-shower measurements from a 2 km$^2$ surface array consisting of 19 water-Cherenkov surface detectors, spaced at 433 m, with the muon measurements from an array of buried scintillators placed in the same area. Using 15 months of data, collected while the array was still under construction, we derive upper limits to the integral photon flux ranging from 13.3 to 13.8 km$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ above tens of PeV. We extend the Pierre Auger Observatory photon search program towards lower energies, covering more than three decades of cosmic-ray energy. This work lays the foundation for future diffuse photon searches: with the data from the next 10 years of operation of the Observatory, this limit is expected to improve by a factor of $\sim$20.

 By reducing variance induced by gravitational lensing, likelihood-based de-lensing techniques have true potential to extract significantly more information from deep and high-resolution Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data than traditional methods. We derive here optimal data compression statistics for the lensed CMB, and clarify the role of each term, demonstrating their direct analogs in the quadratic estimator (QE) framework. We discuss in this light pros and cons of practical implementations, including the MUSE approach, as used in the latest SPT-3G cosmological analysis, and give improvements. We discuss pathways for porting the large robustness and redundancy toolbox of the QE approach to beyond-QE with simple means.

 I find that the accretion disk around the neutron star (NS) that enters the core of a massive evolved star in the frame of the common-envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) r-process scenario can penetrate the crust of the NS, mix neutron-rich crust material into the disk, and enrich the jets that the disk launches with the neutron-rich material. As the NS accretes at high rates from the core inside which it revolves, it forms an accretion disk with high density. In the CEJSN r-process scenario, the very high density in the accretion disk results in low electron fraction gas, enabling the r-process. Jets carry the r-process elements out. The new claim in this study is that the high-density accretion disk destroys part of the NS crust and entrains this mass. The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability mixes material from the deeper crust. The total neutron-rich mass that the disk mixes and the jets carry can be up to ~0.01Mo. Enriching the accretion disk with neutron-rich material ensures a low electron fraction as required by the r-process nucleosynthesis and the ejection of massive r-process ejecta, ~0.01-0.03Mo. I strengthen the CEJSN r-process scenario but do not claim it is the main r-process site. I only claim that two or more r-process sites contribute to r-process nucleosynthesis.

 - **Abstract**
 The quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the X-ray variability of both black hole (BH) and neutron star (NS) systems provide a tool for probing strong gravity and dense matter equations of state. Nevertheless, the mechanism of QPO modulation in NS systems, where the amplitudes of QPOs with frequencies approaching kHz range are very high in comparison to BH high-frequency QPOs, remains an unsolved puzzle. Relativistic ray tracing of photons emitted from the immediate vicinity of compact objects has, to date, been used to investigate various mechanisms that explain the observed weak BH QPOs. However, it has not been applied to model the NS QPO signal, which requires incorporating the NS surface and a bright boundary layer (BL) on it. Here, we explore the QPO modulation mechanisms based on the BL obscuration. Using simplified models of axisymmetric oscillations of thick accretion discs (tori), we demonstrate that the disc oscillations drive the high NS QPO amplitudes through BL obscuration, which is relevant especially for vertical oscillations. We also demonstrate that obscuration effects enable the observability of the Keplerian frequency in the case of discs that decay due to instabilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) have been widely used in imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). The Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), the latest-generation IACTs, are optimized for challenging observations of low-energy gamma rays, specifically in the 20 to 150 GeV range. To this end, PMTs with an exceptionally low afterpulsing probability have been developed and installed. However, the afterpulsing rate increases over time due to the infiltration of atmospheric molecules, particularly helium, into the tube. Interestingly, we found that the afterpulsing rate decreases when PMTs are operated at high voltage and exposed to light -- a condition naturally met during IACT observations. To evaluate the latest instrument response, after five years of operation, we removed several PMTs from the first LST, which is currently the only operational telescope among the CTAO instruments. Our laboratory measurements showed no increase in afterpulsing compared to pre-installation values. This suggests that the decrease in afterpulsing during operation offsets the increase, thereby maintaining the long-term performance of the PMTs.

 - **Abstract**
 The brightest cosmic gamma-ray burst (GRB) ever detected, GRB 221009A, was accompanied by photons of very high energies. These gamma rays may be used to test both the astrophysical models of the burst and our understanding of long-distance propagation of energetic photons, including potential new-physics effects. Here we present the observation of a photon-like air shower with the estimated primary energy of $300^{+43}_{-38}$ TeV, coincident (with the chance probability of $\sim 9\cdot 10^{-3}$) with the GRB in its arrival direction and time. Making use of the upgraded Carpet-3 muon detector and new machine learning analysis, we estimate the probability that the primary was hadronic as $\sim 3 \cdot 10^{-4}$. This is the highest-energy event ever associated with any GRB.

          Titan's Fluvial and Lacustrine Landscapes

 - **Abstract**
 In this chapter we begin with a review of Titan's fluvial and lacustrine landscapes as observed with Cassini remote sensing data, and what the many discoveries have revealed about Titan's surface materials and climate. Yet Cassini remote sensing data are coarse, topographic data are largely lacking, and the absence of in situ field measurements means we have little understanding of what the surface is composed of. At present, our knowledge of Titan's hydrology is comparable to that of Mars in the 1970's during the Viking era. Fortunately, the coming decades promise many new and exciting discoveries that can be achieved through Earth-based experiments, numerical modeling, and a continued commitment to the exploration of Titan by future missions, including both Dragonfly and orbiting assets. We therefore close the chapter with a discussion about what can be done with the current Cassini data and how new data, from both Dragonfly and a potential future orbiter, would allow us to leverage Titan to help solve some of the largest problems both here on Earth and on hydrologic planets and exoplanets more generally.

 - **Abstract**
 Sudden violations of the slow-roll regime during inflation, a natural prediction of many UV-complete inflationary models, give rise to sharp features in the primordial power spectrum. At large scales, these features provide a unique window into the physics of inflation, with constraints primarily derived from Cosmic Microwave Background observations of linearly evolved primordial fluctuations. However, on smaller scales, it is less clear whether primordial features would survive the late-time nonlinear cosmological evolution, as they are expected to be washed out by mode coupling. In this paper, we run dedicated N-body simulations to tackle this question. We demonstrate that, while oscillatory-like patterns are erased over time by nonlinearities, signatures of primordial sharp features can persist through the nonlinear regime of structure formation. Those take the form of a localised power enhancement or decrease in the matter power spectrum, whose amplitude and position can in principle be used to recover the scale of the primordial feature, and an oscillatory pattern in the halo mass function. While these findings highlight the power for constraining inflationary physics at small scales, they also show the challenges posed by potential degeneracies with other physical processes relevant in the nonlinear regime of structure formation such as non-cold dark matter candidates. Our results open new avenues for probing inflationary physics in large scale structures and galactic physics and emphasise the need for refined theoretical tools to robustly constrain primordial features.

 - **Abstract**
 Wide-field photometry of Galactic globular clusters (GCs) has been investigated to overcome limitations from the small field of view of the Hubble Space Telescope in the study of multiple populations. In particular, 'chromosome maps' (ChMs) built with ground-based photometry were constructed to identify the first and second generation stars (1G and 2G) over the wide-field of view. The ChMs allow us to derive the fraction of distinct populations in an analyzed field of view. We present here the radial distribution of the 2G fraction in 29 GCs. The distributions show that all the GCs either have a flat distribution or more centrally concentrated 2G stars. Notably, we find that the fraction of 1G stars outside the half-light radius is clearly bifurcated across all mass range. It implies that a group of GCs with lower 1G fractions (hereafter Group II) have efficiently lost their 1G stars in the outermost cluster regions. In fact, in connection with the trends of the radial distribution, most GCs of Group II have spatially mixed populations, while only less massive GCs in Group I (a group with higher 1G fraction) show that feature. Lastly, we investigate links between these two groups and host cluster parameters. We find that most GCs of Group II are distributed along a broader range of galactocentric distances with smaller perigalactic distances < 3.5 kpc. Besides, by using the Gaia data, it is observed that Group II GCs have higher energy on the integrals of motion diagrams than Group I GCs.
