Cutting-edge astronomy initiatives often entail substantial investment and require a high level of expertise. Even the most technologically advanced nations recognize the value of establishing international partnerships to secure both financial resources and talent for these ambitious endeavours as they hold immense promise for catalysing transformative scientific discoveries, driving technological innovation, provide training opportunities for the next generation of scientists and engineers, and expanding our understanding of the cosmos that surrounds us. Crucially, large-scale multilateral collaborations serve as powerful agents for promoting unity and peace among the global population. Participants from various nations share a vested interest in the success of these projects and the wealth of knowledge they yield, fostering a sense of common purpose and shared goals. By utilizing astroinformatics capabilities, these initiatives are not merely enhancing our comprehension of the universe but are also actively contributing to the attainment of sustainable development objectives. In this discussion, we delve into the challenges faced, and prospects for substantial astronomical undertakings. Additionally, we present recommendations aimed at guaranteeing their effectiveness and optimizing their influence on both scientific advancement and society.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce SigNova, a new semi-supervised framework for detecting anomalies in streamed data. While our initial examples focus on detecting radio-frequency interference (RFI) in digitized signals within the field of radio astronomy, it is important to note that SigNova's applicability extends to any type of streamed data. The framework comprises three primary components. Firstly, we use the signature transform to extract a canonical collection of summary statistics from observational sequences. This allows us to represent variable-length visibility samples as finite-dimensional feature vectors. Secondly, each feature vector is assigned a novelty score, calculated as the Mahalanobis distance to its nearest neighbor in an RFI-free training set. By thresholding these scores we identify observation ranges that deviate from the expected behavior of RFI-free visibility samples without relying on stringent distributional assumptions. Thirdly, we integrate this anomaly detector with Pysegments, a segmentation algorithm, to localize consecutive observations contaminated with RFI, if any. This approach provides a compelling alternative to classical windowing techniques commonly used for RFI detection. Importantly, the complexity of our algorithm depends on the RFI pattern rather than on the size of the observation window. We demonstrate how SigNova improves the detection of various types of RFI (e.g., broadband and narrowband) in time-frequency visibility data. We validate our framework on the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) telescope and simulated data and the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA).

 - **Abstract**
 Overdensities in the radial phase space $(r,v_r)$ of the Milky Way's halo have previously been associated with the phase-mixed debris of a highly radial merger event, such as Gaia Sausage-Enceladus. We present and test an alternative theory in which the overdense 'chevrons' are instead composed of stars trapped in resonances with the Galactic bar. We develop an analytic model of resonant orbits in the isochrone potential, and complement this with a test particle simulation of a stellar halo in a realistic barred Milky Way potential. These models are used to predict the appearance of action space $(J_\phi,J_r)$ and radial phase space in the Solar neighbourhood. They are able to reproduce almost all salient features of the observed chevrons. In particular, both the analytic model and simulation predict that the chevrons are more prominent at $v_r<0$ when viewed near the Sun, as is observed by Gaia. This is inconsistent with formation by an ancient merger event. We also associate individual chevrons with specific resonances. At a bar pattern speed of $\Omega_\mathrm{b}=35$ km s$^{-1}$kpc$^{-1}$, the two most prominent prograde chevrons align very closely with the corotation and outer Lindblad resonances. The former can be viewed as a highly eccentric extension of the Hercules stream. Finally, our model predicts that the $v_r$ asymmetry changes sign as a function of Galactic radius and azimuth, and we find evidence that this is indeed the case in the Milky Way.
#### Hydrogenated amorphous carbon grains as an alternative carrier of the  9$-$13$μ$m plateau feature in the fullerene planetary nebula Tc 1

 - **Abstract**
 Fullerenes have been observed in several astronomical objects since the discovery of C$_{60}$ in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectrum of the planetary nebula (PN) Tc 1. It has been suggested that the carriers of the broad unidentified infrared (UIR) plateau features, such as the 9$-$13$\mu$m emission feature (12$\mu$m hereafter), may be related to the formation of fullerenes. In particular, their carriers have been suggested to be mixed aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hydrogenated amorphous carbon (HAC-like hereafter) grains. For this study, we modeled the mid-IR emission of the C$_{60}$-PN Tc 1 with a photoionization code, including for the first time the laboratory optical constants ($n$ and $k$ indices) of HAC-like dust at 300 K. Interestingly, we find that the broad 12$\mu$m plateau feature in Tc 1 is well reproduced by using a distribution of canonical HAC grains, while at the same time they provide an important fraction of the IR dust continuum emission and are consistent with the other UIR features observed (e.g., the broad 6$-$9$\mu$m plateau feature). This finding suggests that HAC-like grains may be possible carriers of the 12$\mu$m plateau feature, being likely related to the fullerene formation mechanism in PNe. More laboratory experiments, to obtain the optical constants of HAC-like dust with several structures or a composition at different physical conditions, are strongly encouraged -- that is, in order to extend this pilot study to more fullerene PNe, and to unveil the details of fullerene formation and of the potential carriers of the elusive UIR plateau features.

 - **Abstract**
 For ongoing studies of the role of rotation in stellar evolution, we require large catalogs of rotation periods for testing and refining gyrochronology. While there is a wealth of data from the Kepler and K2 missions, TESS presents both an opportunity and a challenge: despite its all-sky coverage, rotation periods remain hard to detect. We analyzed individual TESS sectors to detect short-period stellar rotation, using only parameters measured from light curves for a robust and unbiased method of evaluating detections. We used random forest classifiers for vetting, trained on a large corpus of period measurements in KELT data from the Oelkers et al. (2018) catalog and using TESS full-frame image light curves generated by eleanor (Feinstein et al. 2019). Finally, using data from the first 26 sectors of TESS, we analyzed 432,704 2-minute cadence single-sector light curves for FGKM dwarfs. We detected 16,800 periods in individual sector light curves, covering 10,909 distinct targets, and we present a catalog of the median period for each target as measured by a Lomb-Scargle periodogram.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-wavelength photometry of brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects provides insight into their atmospheres and cloud layers. We present near-simultaneous $J-$ and $K_s-$band multi-wavelength observations of the highly variable T2.5 planetary-mass object, SIMP J013656.5+093347. We reanalyze observations acquired over a single night in 2015 using a recently developed data reduction pipeline. For the first time, we detect a phase shift between $J-$ and $K_s-$band light curves, which we measure to be $39.9^{\circ +3.6}_{ -1.1}$. Previously, phase shifts between near-infrared and mid-infrared observations of this object were detected and attributed to probing different depths of the atmosphere, and thus different cloud layers. Using the Sonora Bobcat models, we expand on this idea to show that at least two different patchy cloud layers must be present to explain the measured phase shift. Our results are generally consistent with recent atmospheric retrievals of this object and other similar L/T transition objects.
#### ALMA-IMF XI: The sample of hot core candidates A rich population of  young high-mass proto-stars unveiled by the emission of methyl formate

 - **Abstract**
 Sites associated with high-mass star and cluster formation exhibit a so-called hot core phase, characterized by high temperatures and column densities of complex organic molecules. We built a comprehensive census of hot core candidates towards the ALMA-IMF protoclusters based on the detection of two CH3OCHO emission lines at 216.1 GHz. We used the source extraction algorithm GExt2D to identify peaks of methyl formate (CH3OCHO) emission that is a complex species commonly observed towards sites of star formation. We built up a catalog of 76 hot core candidates with masses ranging from about 0.2 to 80 Msun , of which 56 are new detections. A large majority of these objects are compact, rather circular, with deconvolved FWHM sizes of about 2300 au on average. About 30% of our sample of methyl formate sources have core masses above 8 Msun within sizes ranging from about 1000 au to 13400 au, which well correspond to archetypical hot cores. The origin of the CH3OCHO emission toward the lower-mass cores can be explained by a mixture of contribution from shocks, or may correspond to objects in a more evolved state, i.e. beyond the hot core stage. We find that the fraction of hot core candidates increases with the core mass. The large fraction of hot core candidates towards the most massive cores suggests that they rapidly enter the hot core phase and feedback effects from the forming protostar(s) impact their environment on short time-scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Specutils is an Astropy affiliated package which provides a consistent interface to astronomical spectra (primarily 1D). As Specutils can be adapted to parse spectra in many different formats, Specutils plays a key role at Data Central, allowing us to handle the diverse formats provided to us by survey teams. In this poster, I will cover what Specutils is, how it works, how Data Central uses it, and why you too should use and contribute to it.
#### Investigation of profile shifting and subpulse movement in PSR  J0344-0901 with FAST

 - **Abstract**
 We report two phenomena detected in PSR J0344$-$0901 from two observations conducted at frequency centered at 1.25 GHz using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The first phenomenon manifests as shifting in the pulse emission to later longitudinal phases and then gradually returns to its original location. The event lasts for about 216 pulse periods, with an average shift of about $0.7^\circ$ measured at the peak of the integrated profile. Changes in the polarization position angle (PPA) are detected around the trailing edge of the profile, together with an increase in the profile width. The second phenomenon is characterized by the apparent movement of subpulses, which results in different subpulse track patterns across the profile window. For the first time in this pulsar, we identify four emission modes, each with unique subpulse movement, and determine the pattern periods for three of the emission modes. Pulse nulling was not detected. Modeling of the changes in the PPA using the rotating vector model gives an inclination angle of $75.12^\circ \pm 3.80^\circ$ and an impact parameter of $-3.17^\circ \pm 5.32^\circ$ for this pulsar. We speculate that the subpulse movement may be related to the shifting of the pulse emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Around a million quasars have been catalogued in the Universe by probing deeper and using new methods for discovery. However, the hardest ones to find seem to be the rarest and brightest specimen. In this work, we study the properties of the most luminous of all quasars found so far. It has been overlooked until recently, which demonstrates that modern all-sky surveys have much to reveal. The black hole in this quasar accretes around one solar mass per day onto an existing mass of $\sim$17 billion solar masses. In this process its accretion disc alone releases a radiative energy of $2\times 10^{41}$ Watts. If the quasar is not strongly gravitationally lensed, then its broad line region (BLR) is expected to have the largest physical and angular diameter occurring in the Universe, and will allow the Very Large Telescope Interferometer to image its rotation and measure its black hole mass directly. This will be an important test for BLR size-luminosity relations, whose extrapolation has underpinned common black-hole mass estimates at high redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 The excesses in the electron and positron spectra observed by many experiments, such as PAMELA and AMS-02, have sparked significant theoretical investigation. It is not easy to distinguish the two primary hypotheses dark matter annihilation/decay and pulsars from the spectral features. Should pulsars be the source of this excess, the expected variability in their distribution may introduce distinct irregularities in the positron energy spectrum. In this study, we use an irregularity estimator to detect these potential features in the positron energy spectrum of AMS-02. Our analysis of the current AMS-02 data reveals these spectral irregularities with a statistical significance of $1.75\sigma$. However, our projection indicates that, with AMS-02 data collected over a period of 20 years, such irregularities could be identified with a confidence level of $3\sigma$ level in 71\% of our simulations.
#### On a precessing jet-nozzle scenario with a common helical  trajectory-pattern for blazar 3C345

 - **Abstract**
 The kinematics and flux evolution of the superluminal knots in blazar 3C345 were interpreted in the framework of the precessing jet-nozzle scenario with a precessing common helical trajectory-pattern. We show that the jet in 3C345 precesses with a period of 7.3yr and the superluminal knots move consistently along a precessing common helical trajectory-pattern in their inner jet regions, which can extend to core distances of about 1.2mas or traveled distances of about 300pc (for knots C4 and C9). Through model-fitting of the observed kinematic behavior of the superluminal knots, their bulk Lorentz factor and Doppler factor were derived as continuous functions of time, which were used to investigate their flux evolution. We found that the light curves measured at 15, 22 and 43GHz can be well model-fitted in terms of their Doppler boosting profiles associated with their superluminal motion. Flux fluctuations on shorter time scales also exist due to knots' intrinsic variations in flux density and spectral index. The close association of the flux evolution with the Doppler boosting effect is important, firmly vadidating the precessing jet-nozzle scenario being fully appropriate to explain both the kinematics and emission properties of the superluminal knots in 3C345. We have proposed both the precessing jet-nozzle scenarios with a single jet and double jets (this paper and Qian[2022b]) to understand the VLBI phenomena in 3C345. VLBI-observations with higher resolutions deep into the core regions (core distances less than 0.1mas) are required to test them.
#### How do wavelength correlations affect your transmission spectrum?  Application of a new fast and flexible 2D Gaussian process framework to  transiting exoplanet spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 The use of Gaussian processes (GPs) is a common approach to account for correlated noise in exoplanet time-series, particularly for transmission and emission spectroscopy. This analysis has typically been performed for each wavelength channel separately, with the retrieved uncertainties in the transmission spectrum assumed to be independent. However, the presence of noise correlated in wavelength could cause these uncertainties to be correlated, which could significantly affect the results of atmospheric retrievals. We present a method which uses a GP to model noise correlated in both wavelength and time simultaneously for the full spectroscopic data set while avoiding the use of a 'common-mode' correction. To make this analysis computationally tractable, we introduce a fast and flexible GP method which can analyse 2D data sets when the input points lie on a (potentially non-uniform) 2D grid - in our case a time by wavelength grid - and the kernel function has a Kronecker product structure. This simultaneously fits all light curves and enables the retrieval of the covariance matrix of the transmission spectrum. By testing on synthetic data sets, we demonstrate that our new approach can reliably recover atmospheric features contaminated by noise correlated in time and wavelength. In contrast, fitting each spectroscopic light curve separately performed poorly when wavelength-correlated noise was present. It frequently underestimated the uncertainty of the scattering slope and overestimated the uncertainty in the strength of sharp absorption peaks in transmission spectra. Two archival VLT/FORS2 transit observations of WASP-31b were re-analysed, with our method strongly constraining the presence of wavelength-correlated noise in both data sets and recovering significantly different constraints on atmospheric features such as the scattering slope and strength of sodium and potassium features.

 - **Abstract**
 Historically the most popular dark matter candidates have been new elementary particles, such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles and axions. However Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), black holes formed from overdensities in the early Universe, are another possibility. The discovery of gravitational waves from mergers of tens of Solar mass black hole binaries by LIGO-Virgo has generated a surge in interest in PBH dark matter. We overview the formation of PBHs, observational probes of their abundance, and some of the key open questions in the field.
#### Systematic effects on a Compton polarimeter at the focus of an X-ray  mirror

 - **Abstract**
 XL-Calibur is a balloon-borne Compton polarimeter for X-rays in the $\sim$15-80 keV range. Using an X-ray mirror with a 12 m focal length for collecting photons onto a beryllium scattering rod surrounded by CZT detectors, a minimum-detectable polarization as low as $\sim$3% is expected during a 24-hour on-target observation of a 1 Crab source at 45$^{\circ}$ elevation. Systematic effects alter the reconstructed polarization as the mirror focal spot moves across the beryllium scatterer, due to pointing offsets, mechanical misalignment or deformation of the carbon-fiber truss supporting the mirror and the polarimeter. Unaddressed, this can give rise to a spurious polarization signal for an unpolarized flux, or a change in reconstructed polarization fraction and angle for a polarized flux. Using bench-marked Monte-Carlo simulations and an accurate mirror point-spread function characterized at synchrotron beam-lines, systematic effects are quantified, and mitigation strategies discussed. By recalculating the scattering site for a shifted beam, systematic errors can be reduced from several tens of percent to the few-percent level for any shift within the scattering element. The treatment of these systematic effects will be important for any polarimetric instrument where a focused X-ray beam is impinging on a scattering element surrounded by counting detectors.
#### Classification of compact radio sources in the Galactic plane with  supervised machine learning

 - **Abstract**
 Generation of science-ready data from processed data products is one of the major challenges in next-generation radio continuum surveys with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and its precursors, due to the expected data volume and the need to achieve a high degree of automated processing. Source extraction, characterization, and classification are the major stages involved in this process. In this work we focus on the classification of compact radio sources in the Galactic plane using both radio and infrared images as inputs. To this aim, we produced a curated dataset of ~20,000 images of compact sources of different astronomical classes, obtained from past radio and infrared surveys, and novel radio data from pilot surveys carried out with the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP). Radio spectral index information was also obtained for a subset of the data. We then trained two different classifiers on the produced dataset. The first model uses gradient-boosted decision trees and is trained on a set of pre-computed features derived from the data, which include radio-infrared colour indices and the radio spectral index. The second model is trained directly on multi-channel images, employing convolutional neural networks. Using a completely supervised procedure, we obtained a high classification accuracy (F1-score>90%) for separating Galactic objects from the extragalactic background. Individual class discrimination performances, ranging from 60% to 75%, increased by 10% when adding far-infrared and spectral index information, with extragalactic objects, PNe and HII regions identified with higher accuracies. The implemented tools and trained models were publicly released, and made available to the radioastronomical community for future application on new radio data.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are commonly attributed to the demise of massive stars or the merger of binary compact objects. However, their varied emission characteristics strongly imply the existence of multiple GRB classes based on progenitor types, radiation mechanisms, central engines etc. This study utilizes unsupervised clustering with the Nested Gaussian Mixture Model algorithm to analyze {\it Fermi} and BATSE GRB data, identifying four classes (A, B, C, and D) based on duration, spectral peak, and spectral index, comprising approximately 70\%, 10\%, 3\%, and 17\% of the dataset, respectively. Classes A and B consist of long GRBs, C mainly short GRBs, and class D encompasses both short and long GRBs. Using the spectral index, $\alpha$, for the differentiation of radiation models, it is found that classes B and C align with photospheric emission models, while A and D predominantly show synchrotron radiation characteristics. Short GRBs predominantly exhibit photospheric emission, whereas long GRBs show consistency with synchrotron emission. Overall, 63\% of the total bursts exhibit $\alpha$ profiles indicative of synchrotron emission, with the remaining 37\% associated with photospheric emission. The classes were further examined for their progenitor origins, revealing that classes A and D demonstrate a hybrid nature, while classes B and C are predominantly associated with collapsar and merger origins, respectively. This clustering analysis reveals distinct GRB classes, shedding light on their diversity in radiation, duration and progenitor.

 - **Abstract**
 The kinematic structure of the Radcliffe Wave (RW) is crucial for understanding its origin and evolution. In this work, we present an accurate measurement of the vertical velocity $V_Z$ by where the radial velocity (RV) measures are taken into consideration. This is achieved in two ways. First, the velocities are measured towards Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), using their RV and proper motion measurements from APOGEE-2 and Gaia DR3. Second, we combine RV measurements toward clouds with proper motion measurements of associated YSOs to determine the vertical velocities of the clouds. The results reveal that the oscillations in $V_Z$ are not synchronous with the vertical coordinate. The difference is caused by a combination of the effect of the radial velocity which we include in this paper, and the difference in models. By supplementing our analysis with additional young star samples, we find a consistent dipole pattern in $V_Z$. The fact that no significant amplitude differences are found among the analyzed samples indicates that there is no apparent age gradient within the dipole. We propose that RW evolves at a relatively slow rate. The fact that it will take a much longer time for RW to complete a full period compared to the cloud lifetimes challenges its classification as a traditional "wave". This age discrepancy should explain the phase difference, and non-synchronous oscillation found in kinematic studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Integrated superconducting spectrometers (ISSs) for wideband sub-mm astronomy utilise quasi-optical systems for coupling radiation from the telescope to the instrument. Misalignment in these systems is detrimental to the system performance. The common method of using an optical laser to align the quasi-optical components requires accurate alignment of the laser to the sub-mm beam coming from the instrument, which is not always guaranteed to a sufficient accuracy. We develop an alignment strategy for wideband ISSs directly utilising the sub-mm beam of the wideband ISS. The strategy should be applicable in both telescope and laboratory environments. Moreover, the strategy should deliver similar quality of the alignment across the spectral range of the wideband ISS. We measure misalignment in a quasi-optical system operating at sub-mm wavelengths using a novel phase and amplitude measurement scheme, capable of simultaneously measuring the complex beam patterns of a direct-detecting ISS across a harmonic range of frequencies. The direct detection nature of the MKID detectors in our device-under-test, DESHIMA 2.0, necessitates the use of this measurement scheme. Using geometrical optics, the measured misalignment, a mechanical hexapod, and an optimisation algorithm, we follow a numerical approach to optimise the positioning of corrective optics with respect to a given cost function. Laboratory measurements of the complex beam patterns are taken across a harmonic range between 205 and 391 GHz and simulated through a model of the ASTE telescope in order to assess the performance of the optimisation at the ASTE telescope. Laboratory measurements show that the optimised optical setup corrects for tilts and offsets of the sub-mm beam. Moreover, we find that the simulated telescope aperture efficiency is increased across the frequency range of the ISS after the optimisation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first detection in space of O-protonated carbonyl sulfide (\ch{HOCS+}), in the midst of an ultradeep molecular line survey toward the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud. From the observation of all $K$$_a$ = 0 transitions ranging from $J$$_{lo}$ = 2 to $J$$_{lo}$ = 13 of \ch{HOCS+} covered by our survey, we derive a column density of $N$ = (9 $\pm$ 2)$\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, translating into a fractional abundance relative to H$_2$ of $\sim$7$\times$10$^{-11}$. Conversely, the S-protonated \ch{HSCO+} isomer remains undetected, and we derive an upper limit to its abundance with respect to H$_2$ of $\leq$3$\times$10$^{-11}$, a factor of $\geq$2.3 less abundant than \ch{HOCS+}. We obtain a \ch{HOCS+}/OCS ratio of $\sim$2.5$\times$10$^{-3}$, in good agreement with the prediction of astrochemical models. These models show that one of the main chemical routes to the interstellar formation of \ch{HOCS+} is likely the protonation of OCS, which appears to be more efficient at the oxygen end. Also, we find that high values of cosmic-ray ionisation rates (10$^{-15}$-10$^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$) are needed to reproduce the observed abundance of \ch{HOCS+}. In addition, we compare the O/S ratio across different interstellar environments. G+0.693-0.027 appears as the source with the lowest O/S ratio. We find a \ch{HOCO+}/\ch{HOCS+} ratio of $\sim$31, in accordance with other O/S molecular pairs detected toward this region and also close to the O/S solar value ($\sim$37). This fact indicates that S is not significantly depleted within this cloud due to the action of large-scale shocks, unlike in other sources where S-bearing species remain trapped on icy dust grains.

 - **Abstract**
 Filaments are omnipresent features in the solar atmosphere. Their location, properties and time evolution can provide information about changes in solar activity and assist the operational space weather forecast. Therefore, filaments have to be identified in full disk images and their properties extracted from these images. Manual extraction is tedious and takes much time; extraction with morphological image processing tools produces a large number of false-positive detections. Automatic object detection, segmentation, and extraction in a reliable manner allows to process more data in a shorter time. The Chromospheric Telescope (ChroTel), Tenerife, Spain, the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG), and the Kanzelh\"ohe Observatory (KSO), Austria, provide regular full-disk observations of the Sun in the core of the chromospheric H-alpha absorption line. We present a deep learning method that provides reliable extractions of filaments from H-alpha filtergrams. First, we train the object detection algorithm YOLOv5 with labeled filament data of ChroTel. We use the trained model to obtain bounding-boxes from the full GONG archive. In a second step, we apply a semi-supervised training approach, where we use the bounding boxes of filaments, to learn a pixel-wise classification of filaments with u-net. Here, we make use of the increased data set size to avoid overfitting of spurious artifacts from the generated training masks. Filaments are predicted with an accuracy of 92%. With the resulting filament segmentations, physical parameters such as the area or tilt angle can be easily determined and studied. This we demonstrate in one example, where we determine the rush-to-the pole for Solar Cycle 24 from the segmented GONG images. In a last step, we apply the filament detection to H-alpha observations from KSO which demonstrates the general applicability of our method to H-alpha filtergrams.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform real-time hydrodynamical simulations of the growth of bubbles formed during cosmological first-order phase transitions under the assumption of local thermal equilibrium. We confirm that pure hydrodynamic backreaction can lead to steady-state expansion and that bubble-wall velocity in such case agrees very well with the analytical estimates. However, this is not the generic outcome. Instead, it is much more common to observe runaways, as the early-stage dynamics right after the nucleation allow the bubble walls to achieve supersonic velocities before the heated fluid shell in front of the bubble is formed. This effect is not captured by other methods of calculation of the bubble-wall velocity which assume stationary solutions to exist at all times and would have a crucial impact on the possible generation of both baryon asymmetry and gravitational wave signals.

 - **Abstract**
 When starting an N-body simulation of an isolated galaxy, it is desirable to select particles from a distribution function to ensure that the model is in equilibrium. Random sampling from a DF is widely used, but results in a set of particles that differs by shot noise from that intended. This paper presents a method to reduce sampling noise that has been developed by the author in a many collaborations over a number of years. The technique has been partly described in past papers, though the ideas have not previously been gathered together, nor have its advantages been clearly demonstrated in past work. Of course, sampling errors can also be reduced by a brute force increase in the number of particles, but methods to achieve the same effect with fewer particles have obvious advantages. Here we not only describe the method, but also present three sets of simulations to illustrate the practical advantages of reducing sampling error. The improvements are not dramatic, but are clearly worth having.

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme debris discs (EDDs) are bright and warm circumstellar dusty structures around main sequence stars. They may represent the outcome of giant collisions occuring in the terrestrial region between large planetesimals or planetary bodies, and thus provide a rare opportunity to peer into the aftermaths of these events. Here, we report on results of a mini-survey we conducted with the aim to increase the number of known EDDs, investigate the presence of solid-state features around 10{\mu}m in eight EDDs, and classify them into the silica or silicate dominated groups. We identify four new EDDs and derive their fundamental properties. For these, and for four other previously known discs, we study the spectral energy distribution around 10{\mu}m by means of VLT/VISIR photometry in three narrow-band filters and conclude that all eight objects likely exhibit solid-state emission features from sub-micron grains. We find that four discs probably belong to the silicate dominated subgroup. Considering the age distribution of the entire EDD sample, we find that their incidence begins to decrease only after 300 Myr, suggesting that the earlier common picture that these objects are related to the formation of rocky planets may not be exclusive, and that other processes may be involved for older objects (>100 Myr). Because most of the older EDD systems have wide, eccentric companions, we suggest that binarity may play a role in triggering late giant collisions.
#### Length and Velocity Scales in Protoplanetary Disk Turbulence

 - **Abstract**
 In the theory of protoplanetary disk turbulence, a widely adopted \emph{ansatz}, or assumption, is that the turnover frequency of the largest turbulent eddy, $\Omega_L$, is the local Keplerian frequency $\Omega_K$. In terms of the standard dimensionless Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha$ parameter that quantifies turbulent viscosity or diffusivity, this assumption leads to characteristic length and velocity scales given respectively by $\sqrt{\alpha}H$ and $\sqrt{\alpha}c$, in which $H$ and $c$ are the local gas scale height and sound speed. However, this assumption is not applicable in cases when turbulence is forced numerically or driven by some natural processes such as Vertical Shear Instability. Here we explore the more general case where $\Omega_L\ge\Omega_K$ and show that under these conditions, the characteristic length and velocity scales are respectively $\sqrt{\alpha/R'}H$ and $\sqrt{\alpha R'}c$, where $R'\equiv \Omega_L/\Omega_K$ is twice the Rossby number. It follows that $\alpha=\alphat/R'$, where $\sqrt{\alphat} c$ is the root-mean-square average of the turbulent velocities. Properly allowing for this effect naturally explains the reduced particle scale heights produced in shearing box simulations of particles in forced turbulence, and may help with interpreting recent edge-on disk observations; more general implications for observations are also presented. For $R'>1$ the effective particle Stokes numbers are increased, which has implications for particle collision dynamics and growth, as well as for planetesimal formation.
#### A Model for the Redshift-Space Galaxy 4-Point Correlation Function

 - **Abstract**
 The field of cosmology is entering an epoch of unparalleled wealth of observational data thanks to galaxy surveys such as DESI, Euclid, and Roman. Therefore, it is essential to have a firm theoretical basis that allows the effective analysis of the data. With this purpose, we compute the nonlinear, gravitationally-induced connected galaxy 4-point correlation function (4PCF) at the tree level in Standard Perturbation Theory (SPT), including redshift-space distortions (RSD). We begin from the trispectrum and take its inverse Fourier transform into configuration space, exploiting the isotropic basis functions of \cite{Iso_fun}. We ultimately reduce the configuration-space expression to low-dimensional radial integrals of the power spectrum. This model will enable the use of the BAO feature in the connected 4PCF to sharpen our constraints on the expansion history of the Universe. It will also offer an additional avenue for determining the galaxy bias parameters, and thus tighten our cosmological constraints by breaking degeneracies. Survey geometry can be corrected in the 4PCF, and many systematics are localized, which is an advantage over data analysis with the trispectrum. Finally, this work is a first step in using the parity-even 4PCF to calibrate out any possible systematics in the parity-odd 4PCF; comparing our model to the measurement will offer a consistency test that can serve as a "canary in the coal mine" for systematics in the odd sector.
