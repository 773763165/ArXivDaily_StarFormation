 - **Abstract**
 Traditionally, the search for life on exoplanets has been predominantly focused on rocky exoplanets. Hycean worlds are a class of habitable sub-Neptunes with planet-wide oceans and H2-rich atmospheres. Their broad range of possible sizes and temperatures lead to a wide habitable zone and high potential for discovery and atmospheric characterization using transit spectroscopy. Over a dozen candidate Hycean planets are already known to be transiting nearby M dwarfs, making them promising targets for atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In this work, we investigate possible chemical conditions on a canonical Hycean world, focusing on (a) the present and primordial molecular composition of the atmosphere, and (b) the inventory of bioessential elements for the origin and sustenance of life in the ocean. Based on photochemical and kinetic modeling for a range of conditions, we discuss the possible chemical evolution and observable present-day composition of its atmosphere. In particular, for reduced primordial conditions the early atmospheric evolution passes through a phase that is rich in organic molecules that could provide important feedstock for prebiotic chemistry. We investigate avenues for delivering bioessential metals to the ocean, considering the challenging lack of weathering from a rocky surface and the ocean separated from the rocky core by a thick icy mantle. Based on ocean depths from internal structure modelling and elemental estimates for the early Earth's oceans, we estimate the requirements for bioessential metals in such a planet. We find that the requirements can be met for plausible assumptions about impact history and atmospheric sedimentation, and supplemented by other steady state sources. We discuss the observational prospects for atmospheric characterisation of Hycean worlds.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we analyze the neutrino-driven winds that emerge in twelve unprecedentedly long-duration 3D core-collapse supernova simulations done using the code Fornax. The twelve models cover progenitors with ZAMS mass between 9 and 60 solar masses. In all our models, we see transonic outflows that are at least two times as fast as the surrounding ejecta and that originate generically from a PNS surface atmosphere that is turbulent and rotating. We find that winds are common features of 3D simulations, even if there is anisotropic early fallback. We find that the basic dynamical properties of 3D winds behave qualitatively similarly to those inferred in the past using simpler 1D models, but that the shape of the emergent wind can be deformed, very aspherical, and channeled by its environment. The thermal properties of winds for less massive progenitors very approximately recapitulate the 1D stationary solutions, while for more massive progenitors they deviate significantly due to aspherical fallback. The $Y_e$ temporal evolution in winds is stochastic, and there can be some neutron-rich phases. Though no strong r-process is seen in any model, a weak r-process can be produced and isotopes up to $^{90}$Zr are synthesized in some models. Finally, we find that there is at most a few percent of a solar mass in the integrated wind component, while the energy carried by the wind itself can be as much as 10-20% of the total explosion energy.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results from a multi-year radio campaign of the superluminous supernova (SLSN) 2017ens, which yielded the earliest radio detection of a SLSN to date at the age of $\sim$3.3 years after explosion. SN2017ens was not detected at radio frequencies in the first $\sim$300\,d of evolution but reached $L_{\nu}\approx 10^{28}\,\rm{erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$ at $\nu\sim 6$ GHz, $\sim1250$ days post-explosion. Interpreting the radio observations in the context of synchrotron radiation from the supernova shock interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM), we infer an effective mass-loss rate of $\approx 10^{-4}\,\rm{M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$ at $r\sim 10^{17}$ cm from the explosion's site, for a wind speed of $v_w=50-60\,\rm{km\,s^{-1}}$ measured from optical spectra. These findings are consistent with the spectroscopic metamorphosis of SN2017ens from hydrogen-poor to hydrogen-rich $\sim190$ d after explosion reported by Chen et al., 2018. SN2017ens is thus an addition to the sample of hydrogen-poor massive progenitors that explode shortly after having lost their hydrogen envelope. The inferred circumstellar densities, implying a CSM mass up to $\sim0.5\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$, and low velocity of the ejection point at binary interactions (in the form of common envelope evolution and subsequent envelope ejection) playing a role in shaping the evolution of the stellar progenitors of SLSNe in the $\lesssim 500$ yr preceding core collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 The physical origins of components in the unified model of quasars such as broad line region (BLR), dust torus, and narrow line region are unresolved. To learn more about them, we focus on studying Changing-State Quasars (also known as Changing-Look Quasars) as they offer the opportunity to observe structural changes associated with state transitions. This can give us insight into the origins of each quasar structure. We aimed to understand the central core structure of one of the most variable Changing-State Quasars, SDSS J125809.31+351943.0, and how it changes before and after the state transition. We performed reverberation mapping with optical spectroscopy to investigate the structure of the BLR and to measure the black hole mass. The results of the reverberation mapping show that the Eddington ratio crossed the value of 0.01 before and after state transition for the black hole mass of $10^{9.46^{+0.15}_{-0.19}}\rm{M_\odot}$. In addition, we compared optical to X-ray spectral indices ($\alpha_{\rm{ox}}$) before and after the state transition to investigate the structure difference of the accretion disk. These variations in $\alpha_{\rm{ox}}$ and the Eddington ratio were found to behave similarly to the state transition seen in X-ray binary systems. We also measured the time-lag between the mid-IR and the optical light curve to estimate the size of the dust torus. From all the acquired information about the BLR and dust torus, we confirmed the existence of two distinct rotating/inflowing BLR components located near the dust torus, probably generated by different processes, which are the origins of the BLRs.

 - **Abstract**
 The work presented in this thesis is focused on the interacting supernova remnants (iSNRs), a class of gamma-ray emitting SNR where the radiation arise from the interaction of the SNR with a massive molecular cloud. At the moment only 16 iSNR are known. Before this work, there was not any population study of these sources. Here is proposed a model for the Galactic population of iSNRs which can be used in order to predict the number of these systems in the Galaxy and how many of these will be detectable by the next generation of {\gamma}-ray instruments. iSNRs are of particular interest for the particle acceleration study because these objects have been proved to be sites of acceleration of protons up to high energies. Furthermore, high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission can pinpoint the presence of energetic leptons or ions and help to constraint the acceleration efficiency and maximum energy of accelerated particles The model presented her was only achievable through the creation of a complete catalog of {\gamma}-ray (both GeV and TeV) supernova remnants that for each supernova remnants gives collect the physical and spectral information available in litterature. Simulating and analyzing the synthetic population, it was found that the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will be able to duplicate the number of detected interacting systems in its survey of the Galactic plane.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the confirmation of a TESS-discovered transiting super-Earth planet orbiting a mid-G star, HD 307842 (TOI-784). The planet has a period of 2.8 days, and the radial velocity (RV) measurements constrain the mass to be 9.67+0.83/-0.82 [Earth Masses]. We also report the discovery of an additional planet candidate on an outer orbit that is most likely non-transiting. The possible periods of the planet candidate are approximately 20 to 63 days, with the corresponding RV semi-amplitudes expected to range from 3.2 to 5.4 m/s and minimum masses from 12.6 to 31.1 [Earth Masses]. The radius of the transiting planet (planet b) is 1.93+0.11/-0.09 [Earth Radii], which results in a mean density of 7.4+1.4/-1.2 g/cm^3 suggesting that TOI-784b is likely to be a rocky planet though it has a comparable radius to a sub-Neptune. We found TOI-784b is located at the lower edge of the so-called ``radius valley'' in the radius vs. insolation plane, which is consistent with the photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss prediction. The TESS data did not reveal any significant transit signal of the planet candidate, and our analysis shows that the orbital inclinations of planet b and the planet candidate are 88.60+0.84/-0.86 degrees and <= 88.3-89.2 degrees, respectively. More RV observations are needed to determine the period and mass of the second object, and search for additional planets in this system.

 - **Abstract**
 ALMA-IMF is an Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Large Program designed to measure the core mass function (CMF) of 15 protoclusters chosen to span their early evolutionary stages. It further aims to understand their kinematics, chemistry, and the impact of gas inflow, accretion, and dynamics on the CMF. We present here the first release of the ALMA-IMF line data cubes (DR1), produced from the combination of two ALMA 12m-array configurations. The data include 12 spectral windows, with eight at 1.3mm and four at 3mm. The broad spectral coverage of ALMA-IMF (~6.7 GHz bandwidth coverage per field) hosts a wealth of simple atomic, molecular, ionised, and complex organic molecular lines. We describe the line cube calibration done by ALMA and the subsequent calibration and imaging we performed. We discuss our choice of calibration parameters and optimisation of the cleaning parameters, and we demonstrate the utility and necessity of additional processing compared to the ALMA archive pipeline. As a demonstration of the scientific potential of these data, we present a first analysis of the DCN (3-2) line. We find that DCN traces a diversity of morphologies and complex velocity structures, which tend to be more filamentary and widespread in evolved regions and are more compact in the young and intermediate-stage protoclusters. Furthermore, we used the DCN (3-2) emission as a tracer of the gas associated with 595 continuum cores across the 15 protoclusters, providing the first estimates of the core systemic velocities and linewidths within the sample. We find that DCN (3-2) is detected towards a higher percentage of cores in evolved regions than the young and intermediate-stage protoclusters and is likely a more complete tracer of the core population in more evolved protoclusters. The full ALMA 12m-array cubes for the ALMA-IMF Large Program are provided with this DR1 release.
