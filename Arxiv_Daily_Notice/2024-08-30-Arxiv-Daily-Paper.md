#### Title:
          Investigating cannibalistic millisecond pulsar binaries using MESA: new constraints from pulsar spin and mass evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Compact binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs), with orbital periods $\lesssim1$d, are key to understanding binary evolution involving massive neutron stars (NSs). Due to ablation of the companion by the rapidly spinning pulsar, these systems are also known as spiders, categorized into two main branches: redbacks (RBs; companion mass in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 M$_{\odot}$) and black widows (BWs; companion mass $\lesssim$ 0.1 M$_{\odot}$). We present models of low- and intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (XRBs) and compare them with observations of Galactic spiders (including the presence/absence of hydrogen lines in their optical spectra). We constrain and quantify the interaction between pulsar and companion. Using MESA, we create the allowed initial parameter space, modeling the irradiation of the companion by the pulsar wind. For the first time in MESA, we include the detailed evolution of the pulsar spin. Efficient mass accretion onto the NS ($70\%$ of mass transferred) with an X-ray irradiated disc, followed by strong irradiation of the companion can explain most properties of the observed spiders. Our RBs continue to the BW regime, connecting the two branches of spiders. Our models explain the lack of hydrogen in some observed BWs with ultra-light companions. The mass required to spin-up a NS to sub-milliseconds is high enough to collapse it into a black hole. Finally, we discuss the formation of RB-like spiders with giant companions and orbital periods of several days (huntsmen) showing that they are unlikely to produce super-massive NSs (maximum accreted mass $\lesssim$0.5 M$_{\odot}$). Cannibalistic MSP binary formation depends heavily on the interplay between accretion onto the pulsar and pulsar wind irradiation. Our work supports earlier claims that RBs evolve into BWs. We also show that the fastest-spinning pulsars may collapse before reaching sub-millisecond spin periods.

 - **Abstract**
 The peculiar motion of massive objects across the line of sight imprints a dipolar temperature anisotropy pattern on the cosmic microwave background known as the moving lens effect. This effect provides a unique probe of the transverse components of the peculiar velocity field, but has not yet been detected due to its small size. We implement and validate a stacking estimator for the moving lens signal using a galaxy catalog as a tracer of massive haloes combined with reconstructed velocities from the galaxy number density field. Using simulations, we forecast detection prospects for the moving lens signal from current and upcoming microwave background and galaxy surveys. We demonstrate a new foreground mitigation strategy sufficient for current data sets, and discuss various sources of systematic error and noise. Upcoming galaxy surveys will provide high-significance statistical detections of the moving lens effect.

          The Remarkable X-ray Spectra and Variability of the Ultraluminous Weak-Line Quasar SDSS J1521+5202

 - **Abstract**
 We present a focused X-ray and multiwavelength study of the ultraluminous weak-line quasar (WLQ) SDSS J1521+5202, one of the few X-ray weak WLQs that is amenable to basic X-ray spectral and variability investigations. J1521+5202 shows striking X-ray variability during 2006--2023, by up to a factor of $\approx 32$ in 0.5--2 keV flux, and our new 2023 Chandra observation caught it in its brightest X-ray flux state to date. Concurrent infrared/optical observations show only mild variability. The 2023 Chandra spectrum can be acceptably described by a power law with intrinsic X-ray absorption, and it reveals a nominal intrinsic level of X-ray emission relative to its optical/ultraviolet emission. In contrast, an earlier Chandra spectrum from 2013 shows apparent spectral complexity that is not well fit by a variety of models, including ionized-absorption or standard Compton-reflection models. Overall, the observations are consistent with the thick-disk plus outflow model previously advanced for WLQs, where a nominal level of underlying X-ray emission plus variable absorption lead to the remarkable observed X-ray variability. In the case of J1521+5202 it appears likely that the outflow, and not the thick disk itself, lies along our line-of-sight and causes the X-ray absorption.

          Tidal Spin-up of Subdwarf B Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars are stripped helium-burning stars that are often found in close binaries, where they experience strong tidal interactions. The dissipation of tidally excited gravity waves alter their rotational evolution throughout the sdB lifetime. While many sdB binaries have well-measured rotational and orbital frequencies, there have been few theoretical efforts to accurately calculate the tidal torque produced by gravity waves. In this work, we directly calculate the tidal excitation of internal gravity waves in realistic sdB stellar models, and integrate the coupled spin-orbit evolution of sdB binaries. We find that for canonical sdB ($M_\mathrm{sdB}=0.47\,M_\odot$) binaries, the transitional orbital period below which they could reach tidal synchronization in the sdB lifetime is $\sim \! 0.2\;\mathrm{days}$, with weak dependence on the companion masses. For low-mass sdBs ($M_\mathrm{sdB}=0.37\,M_\odot$) formed from more massive progenitor stars, the transitional orbital period becomes $\sim \! 0.15\;\mathrm{days}$. These values are very similar to the tidal synchronization boundary ($\sim \! 0.2\;\mathrm{days}$) evident from observations. We discuss the dependence of tidal torques on stellar radii, and we make predictions for the rapidly rotating white dwarfs formed from synchronized sdB binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 The production of complex astronomical data is accelerating, especially with newer telescopes producing ever more large-scale surveys. The increased quantity, complexity, and variety of astronomical data demand a parallel increase in skill and sophistication in developing, deciding, and deploying statistical methods. Understanding limitations and appreciating nuances in statistical and machine learning methods and the reasoning behind them is essential for improving data-analytic proficiency and acumen. Aiming to facilitate such improvement in astronomy, we delineate cautionary tales in statistics via six maxims, with examples drawn from the astronomical literature. Inspired by the significant quality improvement in business and manufacturing processes by the routine adoption of Six Sigma, we hope the routine reflection on these Six Maxims will improve the quality of both data analysis and scientific findings in astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of CN-functionalized aromatics partly addresses the long-standing mystery of the apparent absence of five- and six-membered rings in interstellar environments. N-heterocycles, which are crucial as the fundamental structures of nucleobases, have been a focus of these aromatic searches due to their biological significance. Although N-heterocycles have not been conclusively detected in astrophysical environments, their presence in chondrites and meteorites signifies their interstellar and circumstellar connection. Precise spectral data identifies the unique signatures of molecules, confirming their presence in space. In this light, the present work reports an extensive computational investigation on interstellar 3-pyrroline; a five-membered ring N-heterocycle. This includes an alternative formation route in cold interstellar environments and highly accurate rotational and vibrational spectroscopy. The results indicate that 3-pyrroline can form on dust grain surfaces from vinyl cyanide, as its formation from pyrrole through double hydrogenation may lead to the formation of pyrrole itself via a H$_{2}$ abstraction process. 3-pyrroline's rotational transition at 52.3 GHz offers a potential tool for its detection in cold interstellar regions. Additionally, the strongest infrared features of 3-pyrroline at 16.09 $\mu$m and $\sim$3.50 $\mu$m are observable with JWST. The provided data is crucial for laboratory identification and future interstellar observations of 3-pyrroline at both radio and IR wavelengths.

          Cosmological Stasis from a Single Annihilating Particle Species: Extending Stasis Into the Thermal Domain

 - **Abstract**
 It has recently been shown that extended cosmological epochs can exist during which the abundances associated with different energy components remain constant despite cosmological expansion. Indeed, this "stasis" behavior has been found to arise generically in many BSM theories containing large towers of states, and even serves as a cosmological attractor. However, all previous studies of stasis took place within non-thermal environments, or more specifically within environments in which thermal effects played no essential role in realizing or sustaining the stasis. In this paper, we demonstrate that stasis can emerge and serve as an attractor even within thermal environments, with thermal effects playing a critical role in the stasis dynamics. Moreover, within such environments, we find that no towers of states are needed -- a single state experiencing two-body annihilations will suffice. This work thus extends the stasis phenomenon into the thermal domain and demonstrates that thermal effects can also generally give rise to an extended stasis epoch, even when only a single matter species is involved.

          The AMBRE Project: Lead abundance in Galactic stars

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical evolution of neutron capture elements in the Milky Way is still a matter of debate. Although more and more studies investigate their chemical behaviour, there is still a lack of a significant large sample of abundances of a key heavy element: lead. Lead is the final product of the s-process nucleosynthesis channel and is one of the most stable heavy elements. We analysed high-resolution spectra from the ESO UVES and FEROS archives. Atmospheric parameters were taken from the AMBRE parametrisation. We used the automated abundance method GAUGUIN to derive lead abundances in 653 slow-rotating FGK-type stars from the 368.34nm Pb I line. We present the largest catalogue of homogeneous LTE and non-LTE lead abundances ever published with metallicities ranging from -2.9 to 0.6dex and [Pb/Fe] from -0.7 to 3.3dex. Within this sample, no lead-enhanced Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars were found, but nine lead-enhanced metal-poor stars ([Pb/Fe] > 1.5) were detected. Most of them were already identified as carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars with enrichments in other s-process species. The lead abundance of 13 Gaia Benchmark Stars are also provided. We then investigated the Pb content of the Milky Way disc by computing vertical and radial gradients and found a slightly decreasing [Pb/Fe] radial trend with metallicity. This trend together with other related ratios ([Pb/Eu], [Pb/Ba], and [Pb/alpha]) are interpreted thanks to chemical evolution models. The two-infall model closely reproduces the observed trends with respect to the metallicity. It is also found that the AGB contribution to the Pb Galactic enrichment has to be strongly reduced. Moreover, the contribution of massive stars with rather high rotational velocities should be favoured in the low-metallicity regime.

          The evolution of molecular clouds: global radial collapse

 - **Abstract**
 The star formation efficiency (SFE) measures the proportion of molecular gas converted into stars, while the star formation rate (SFR) indicates the rate at which gas is transformed into stars. Here we propose such a model in the framework of a global radial collapse of molecular clouds, where the collapse velocity depends on the density profile and the initial mass-to-radius ratio of molecular clouds, with the collapse velocity accelerating during the collapse process. This simplified analytical model allows us to estimate a lifetime of giant molecular clouds of approximately $0.44-7.36 \times 10^7\, \rm{yr}$, and a star formation timescale of approximately $0.5-5.88 \times 10^6\, \rm{yr}$. Additionally, we can predict an SFE of approximately $1.59\, \%$, and an SFR of roughly $1.85\, \rm{M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}}$ for the Milky Way in agreement with observations.

 - **Abstract**
 GRAND (the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection) is a proposed next-generation observatory of ultra-high-energy neutrinos, cosmic rays, and gamma rays of cosmic origin, with energies exceeding about 100 PeV. GRAND is envisioned as a collection of large-scale ground arrays of self-triggered radio antennas that target the radio emission from extensive air showers initiated by UHE particles. Three prototype arrays are in operation: GRAND@Nançay in France, GRAND@Auger in Argentina, and GRANDProto300 in China. They test the detection principle and technology of GRAND, in preparation for its next phase, consisting of two arrays of 10'000 antennas each, in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, to be deployed from 2030 on. We present the concept of GRAND, its science goals, the status of the prototypes, their first measurements, and the technical and scientific perspectives that these measurements open for the field.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary stars are responsible for many unusual astrophysical phenomena, including some important explosive cosmic events. The stability criteria for rapid mass transfer and common-envelope evolution are fundamental to binary star evolution. They determine the mass, mass ratio, and orbital distribution of systems such as X-ray binaries and merging gravitational-wave sources. We use our adiabatic mass-loss model to systematically survey metal-poor and solar-metallicity donor thresholds for dynamical timescale mass transfer. The critical mass ratios qad are systematically explored, and the impact of metallicity and nonconservative mass transfer are studied. For metal-poor radiative-envelope donors, qad are smaller than those for solar-metallicity stars at the same evolutionary stage. However, qad do the opposite for convective-envelope donors. Nonconservative mass transfer significantly decreases qad for massive donors. This is because it matters how conservative mass transfer is during the thermal timescale phase immediately preceding a delayed dynamical mass transfer. We apply our theoretical predictions to observed high-mass X-ray binaries that have overfilled their Roche lobes and find a good agreement with their mass ratios. Our results can be applied to study individual binary objects or large samples of binary objects with binary population synthesis codes.

          Irradiation-driven mass transfer for massive companion stars in supersoft X-rays sources

 - **Abstract**
 Supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) have been proposed as one of the progenitors for Type Ia supernovae. However, the exact origin of the quasi-periodic variability in the optical light curve remains a this http URL this work, our goal is to investigate the effect of the feedback of an evolved main-sequence companion star on X-ray irradiation and find whether periodic X-ray irradiation of the companion star could reproduce periodic mass transfer.Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, we modeled the evolutionary track of the companion star under the influence of supersoft X-ray irradiation, and we calculated the resulting mass transfer rate. We find that the supersoft X-ray heating of the companion star can result in the expansion of the companion, causing it to greatly overflow its Roche lobe and thereby increasing the mass transfer rate. The periodic X-ray irradiation on the companion stars leads to periodic changes in the mass transfer rate. For a given companion star, higher irradiation efficiencies result in a higher mass transfer rate. Additionally, the mass transfer rate increases as the mass of the companion star decreases for a given irradiation efficiency. The companion star undergoing thermal timescale mass transfer is periodically irradiated by the X-rays from the WD, which can lead to periodic enhancement of the mass transfer rate. The mechanism could be the origin of the quasi-periodic optical light curve in supersoft X-ray sources.

          A multi-dimensional view of a unified model for TDEs

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) can generate non-spherical, relativistic and optically thick outflows. Simulations show that the radiation we observe is reprocessed by these outflows. According to a unified model suggested by these simulations, the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of TDEs depend strongly on viewing angle: low [high] optical-to-X-ray ratios (OXRs) correspond to face-on [edge-on] orientations. Post-processing with radiative transfer codes have simulated the emergent spectra, but have so far been carried out only in a quasi-1D framework, with three atomic species (H, He and O). Here, we present 2.5D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations which model the emission from a non-spherical outflow, including a more comprehensive set of cosmically abundant species. While the basic trend of OXR increasing with inclination is preserved, the inherently multi-dimensional nature of photon transport through the non-spherical outflow significantly affects the emergent SEDs. Relaxing the quasi-1D approximation allows photons to preferentially escape in (polar) directions of lower optical depth, resulting in a greater variation of bolometric luminosity as a function of inclination. According to our simulations, inclination alone may not fully explain the large dynamic range of observed TDE OXRs. We also find that including metals, other than Oxygen, changes the emergent spectra significantly, resulting in stronger absorption and emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet, as well a greater variation in the OXR as a function of inclination. Whilst our results support previously proposed unified models for TDEs, they also highlight the critical importance of multi-dimensional ionization and radiative transfer.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to improve the asteroseismic modelling efforts for red-giant stars, the numerical computation of theoretical individual oscillation modes for evolved red-giant models has to be made feasible. We aim to derive a method for circumventing the computational cost of computing oscillation spectra for models of red-giant stars with an average large frequency separation $\Delta\nu<15$ $\mu$Hz, thereby allowing for asteroseismic investigations of giants utilising individual frequencies. The proposed Truncated Scanning Method serves as a novel method detailing how the observable individual $l=0,1,2$ frequencies of red giants may be computed on realistic timescales through so-called model truncation. By carefully removing the innermost region of the stellar models, the g-mode influence on the oscillation spectra may be avoided, allowing estimation of the observable regions from the resulting pure p-mode oscillations. The appropriate observable frequency regions are subsequently scanned for the complete and un-truncated stellar model. The observable regions are determined by considering the limitations on observability from the internal mode coupling and damping, yielding consistent frequency spectra obtained at a much reduced computational cost. The Truncated Scanning Method proves the feasibility of obtaining the individual frequencies of red-giant models for a wide range of applications and research, demonstrating an improved computational efficiency by a factor of 10 or better. This means that the inclusion of $l=1,2$ individual frequencies is now a possibility in future asteroseismic modelling efforts of red-giant stars. Further potential avenues for improvements to this method are outlined for future pursuits.

          The Primary Flare Following a Stellar Collision in a Galactic Nucleus

 - **Abstract**
 High-velocity stellar collisions near supermassive black holes may result in a complete disruption of the stars. The initial disruption can have energies on par with supernovae and power a very fast transient. In this work we examine the primary flare that will follow the initial transient, which arises when streams of gas from the disrupted stars travel around the central black hole and collide with each other on the antipodal side with respect to the original collision. We present a simple analytic estimate for the properties of the flare, which depends on the distance of the collision from the central black hole and on the center of mass velocity of the colliding stars. We also present first of their kind radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of a few examples of stellar collisions and post-collision flow of the ejected gas, and calculate the expected bolometric light curves. We find that such post-collision flares are expected to be similar to flares which arise in tidal disruptions events of single stars.

          Efficient Compression of Redshift-Space Distortion Data for Late-Time Modified Gravity Models

 - **Abstract**
 Current cosmological observations allow for deviations from the standard growth of large-scale structures in the universe. These deviations could indicate modifications to General Relativity on cosmological scales or suggest the dynamical nature of dark energy. It is important to characterize these departures in a model-independent manner to understand their significance objectively and explore their fundamental causes more generically across a wider spectrum of theories and models. In this paper, we compress the information from redshift-space distortion data into 2-3 parameters $\mu_i$, which control the ratio between the effective gravitational coupling in Poisson's equation and Newton's constant in several redshift bins in the late universe. We test the efficiency of this compression using mock final-year data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and considering three different models within the class of effective field theories of dark energy. The constraints on the parameters of these models, obtained from both the direct fit to the data and the projection of the compressed parameters onto the parameters of the models, are fully consistent, demonstrating the method's good performance. Then, we apply it to current data and find hints of a suppressed matter growth in the universe at $\sim 2.7\sigma$ C.L., in full accordance with previous works in the literature. Finally, we perform a forecast with DESI data and show that the uncertainties on the parameters $\mu_1$ at $z<1$ and $\mu_2$ at $1<z<3$ are expected to decrease by approximately $40\%$ and $20\%$, respectively, compared to those obtained with current data. Additionally, we project these forecasted constraints onto the parameters of the aforesaid models.

          Pair Counting without Binning -- A New Approach to Correlation Functions in Clustering Statistics

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a novel perspective on correlation functions in the clustering analysis of the large-scale structure of the universe. We first recognise that pair counting in bins of radial separation is equivalent to evaluating counts-in-cells (CIC), which can be modelled using a filtered density field with a binning-window function. This insight leads to an in situ expression for the two-point correlation function (2PCF). Essentially, the core idea underlying our method is to introduce a window function to define the binning scheme, enabling pair-counting without binning. This approach develops a concept of generalised 2PCF, which extends beyond conventional discrete pair counting by accommodating non-sharp-edged window functions. To extend this framework to N-point correlation functions (NPCF) using current optimal edge-corrected estimators, we developed a binning scheme independent of the specific parameterisation of polyhedral configurations. In particular, we demonstrate a fast algorithm for the three-point correlation function (3PCF), where triplet counting is accomplished by assigning either a spherical tophat or a Gaussian filter to each vertex of triangles. Additionally, we derive analytical expressions for the 3PCF using a multipole expansion in Legendre polynomials, accounting for filtered field (binning) corrections. Numerical tests using several suites of N-body simulation samples show that our approach aligns remarkably well with the theoretical predictions. Our method provides an exact solution for quantifying binning effects in practical measurements and offers a high-speed algorithm, enabling high-order clustering analysis in extremely large datasets from ongoing and upcoming surveys such as Euclid, LSST, and DESI.

          Emergence of high-mass stars in complex fiber networks (EMERGE) IV. Environmental dependence of the fiber widths

 - **Abstract**
 Despite their variety of scales throughout the interstellar medium, filaments in nearby low-mass clouds show a characteristic width of $\sim$ 0.1 pc from the analysis of {\it Herschel} observations. The origin of this characteristic width, however, has been a matter of intense discussions during the last decade. We explored a possible variation in this typical width with the EMERGE Early ALMA Survey, which includes seven star-forming regions in Orion (OMC-1/-2/-3/-4 South, LDN 1641N, NGC 2023, Flame Nebula). These targets, which exhibit different physical conditions, star formation histories, mass, and density regimes, were homogeneously surveyed at a resolution of $\sim$ 2000 au in N$_2$H$^+$ (1$-$0) with ALMA+IRAM-30m observations. We characterised the column density and temperature radial profiles of the 152 fibers identified in the survey using the automatic fitting routine FilChap. These Orion fibers show a departure from the isothermal condition with significant outward temperature gradients with $\nabla T_\mathrm{K} > 30$ K pc$^{-1}$. They also show a median full width at half maximum ($FWHM$) of $\sim 0.05$ pc, with a corresponding median aspect ratio of $\sim2$. More relevantly, we observe a systematic variation in these fiber $FWHM$ between different regions in our sample, and a direct inverse dependence of these $FWHM$ on their central column density, $N_0$, above $\gtrsim 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. This dependency agrees with the expected $N_0-FWHM$ anti-correlation predicted in previous theoretical studies. Our homogeneous analysis returns the first observational evidence of an intrinsic and systematic variation in the fiber widths across different star-forming regions. While sharing comparable mass, length, and kinematic properties in all of our targets, fibers appear to adjust their $FWHM$ to their density and to the pressure in their host environment.

 - **Abstract**
 Eclipses of radio emission have been reported for ~ 58 spider millisecond pulsars (MSP), of which only around 19% have been extensively studied. Such studies at low frequencies are crucial for probing the properties of the eclipse medium, as eclipses are more prominent at such frequencies. This study investigates eclipses in 10 MSPs in compact orbit using wide-bandwidth observations with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. We report the first evidence of eclipsing for PSR J2234+0944 and J2214+3000 in one epoch, while no evidence of eclipsing was observed in the subsequent two epochs, indicating temporal evolution of the eclipse cutoff frequency in these systems. Constraints on the eclipse cutoff frequency were obtained for PSR J1555-2908, J1810+1744, and J2051-0827. Moreover, for the first time, we detected an eclipse at a non-standard orbital phase (~ 0.5) for PSR J1810+1744, with a duration longer than the eclipse observed at superior conjunction. No eclipses were detected for PSR J0751+1807, J1738+0333, and J1807-2459A at 300-500 MHz and 550-750 MHz, for which we discuss the possible reasons. We calculated the mass loss rates of the companions for PSR J1555-2908 and PSR J1810+1744, and found that these rates are insufficient to ablate the companion stars. We cataloged the $\dot{E}/a^2$, mass function, roche lobe filling factor, and inclination angle for compact MSP binaries with low-mass companions and found that higher spin-down flux does not guarantee eclipses. Our analysis, supported by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, reveals that eclipsing black widow binaries generally exhibit a higher mass function compared to non-eclipsing black widow binaries, as reported by previous studies for a limited sample of black widow MSPs.

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of high-resolution, near-infrared instruments such as VLT/SPHERE and Gemini/GPI has helped uncover a wealth of substructure in planet-forming disks, including large, prominent spiral arms in MWC 758, SAO 206462, and V1247 Ori among others. In the classical theory of disk-planet interaction, these arms are consistent with Lindblad-resonance driving by multi-Jupiter-mass companions. Despite improving detection limits, evidence for such massive bodies in connection with spiral substructure has been inconclusive. In search of an alternative explanation, we use the PLUTO code to run 3D hydrodynamical simulations with two comparatively low planet masses (Saturn-mass, Jupiter-mass) and two thermodynamic prescriptions (three-temperature radiation hydrodynamics, and the more traditional $\beta$-cooling) in a low-mass disk. In the radiative cases, an $m = 2$ mode, potentially attributable to the interaction of stellar radiation with gap-edge asymmetries, creates an azimuthal pressure gradient, which in turn gives rise to prominent spiral arms in the upper layers of the disk. Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) post-processing with RADMC3D reveals that in near-infrared scattered light, these gap-edge spirals are significantly more prominent than the traditional Lindblad spirals for planets in the mass range tested. Our results demonstrate that even intermediate-mass protoplanets -- less detectable, but more ubiquitous, than super-Jupiters -- are capable of indirectly inducing large-scale spiral disk features, and underscore the importance of including radiation physics in efforts to reproduce observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) have been recently discovered in the short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) 910711 and 931101B. Their frequencies are consistent with those of the radial and quadrupolar oscillations of binary neutron star merger remnants, as obtained in numerical relativity simulations. These simulations reveal quasiuniversal relations between the remnant oscillation frequencies and the tidal coupling constant of the binaries. Under the assumption that the observed QPOs are due to these postmerger oscillations, we use the frequency-tide relations in a Bayesian framework to infer the source redshift, as well as the chirp mass and the binary tidal deformability of the binary neutron star progenitors for GRBs 910711 and 931101B. We further use this inference to estimate bounds on the mass-radius relation for neutron stars. By combining the estimates from the two GRBs, we find a 68\% credible range $R_{1.4}=12.48^{+0.41}_{-0.41}$~km for the radius of a neutron star with mass $M=1.4$~M$_\odot$, which is one of the tightest bounds to date.

 - **Abstract**
 Asymmetric 3D structures are observed in the outflows of evolved low- and intermediate-mass stars, and are believed to be shaped through the interaction of companions that are hidden within the dense wind. We investigate how triple systems can shape the outflow of AGB stars. We focus on coplanar systems in a hierarchical, stable orbit, consisting of an AGB star with one relatively close companion, and one at large orbital separation. We model a grid of hierarchical triple systems including a wind-launching AGB star, with the smoothed-particle-hydrodynamic Phantom code. We vary the outer companion mass, the AGB wind velocity and the orbital eccentricities to study the impact of these parameters on the wind morphology. Further, we investigate if the outflow of the AGB star R Aql could be shaped by a triple system, by post-processing one of our triple models with a radiative transfer routine, and comparing this to data of the ALMA ATOMIUM programme. The characteristic wind structures resulting from a hierarchical triple system are the following. A large two-edged spiral wake results behind the outer companion star. This structure lies on top of the spiral structure formed by the close binary, which is affected by the orbital motion around the system centre-of-mass. This dense inner spiral pattern interacts with, and strongly impacts, the spiral wake of the outer companion, resulting in a waved-pattern on the outer edge of this spiral wake. From the comparison of our models to the observations of R Aql, we conclude that this circumstellar environment might be shaped by a similar system as the ones modelled in this work, but an elaborate study of the observational data is needed to determine better the orbital parameters and characteristics of the central system.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) are considered viable candidates for dark matter and the seeds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), with their fruitful physical influences providing significant insights into the conditions of the early Universe. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) $\mu$ distortion tightly constrain the abundance of PBHs in the mass range of $10^4 \sim 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ recently, limiting their potential to serve as seeds for the SMBHs observed. Given that $\mu$ distortion directly constrain the primordial power spectrum, it is crucial to employ more precise methods in computing PBH abundance to strengthen the reliability of these constraints. By a Press-Schechter (PS) type method utilizing the compaction function, we find that the abundance of PBHs could be higher than previously estimated constraints from $\mu$ distortion observations. Furthermore, our analysis shows that variations in the shape of the power spectrum have a negligible impact on our conclusions within the mass ranges under consideration. This conclusion provides us a perspective for further research on the constrain of PBH by $\mu$ distortion.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we explore the possible scenario of strange stars admixed with fermionic or bosonic dark matter. For the description of the ``visible'' sector, we use a specific phenomenological quark model that takes into account in-medium effects for the quark masses through a suitable baryonic density dependence, in which the free parameters are chosen from the analysis of the stellar matter stability window (parametrizations presenting lower energy per baryon than iron nuclei). In the case of the dark sector, we investigate the predictions of fermionic and bosonic models. In the former we consider a spin $1/2$ dark particle, and the latter is described by a dark scalar meson. Both models present a repulsive vector interaction, particularly important for the bosonic model since it helps avoiding the collapse of the star due to the lack of the degeneracy pressure. Our results point out to possible stable strange stars configurations in agreement with data from PSR~J0030+0451, PSR~J0740+6620, NICER and HESS~J1731-347. As another feature, we find stars with dark matter halo configurations for lower values of the dark particle mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiplexed surveys have the ambition to grow larger for the next generation of focal plane instruments. Future projects such as Spec-S5, MUST, and WST have an ever-growing need for multi-object spectroscopy (13,000 - 20,000 simultaneous objects) which demands further investigations of novel focal plane instrumentation. In this paper, we present a rigorous study of focal plane coverage optimization and assembly of triangular modules of alpha-beta fiber positioners with a 6.2 mm pitch. The main focus here is to examine different module arrangements namely, framed, semi-frameless, and fullyframeless assemblies. Framed and semi-frameless describe here the usage of a manufactured focal plate to hold the modules together and provide the correct focus and tilt to the fibers. Work on automatically generating such focal plates for project adaptability and ease of manufacturing will also be presented. On the other hand, the frameless approach proposes a connection method freed from the need of a focal plate. The following paper will also present their capabilities to meet the requirements for focal plane assembly such as focus, tilt and coverage.

 - **Abstract**
 The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on-board the ESA Solar Orbiter mission retrieves the coordinates of solar flare locations by means of a specific sub-collimator, named the Coarse Flare Locator (CFL). When a solar flare occurs on the Sun, the emitted X-ray radiation casts the shadow of a peculiar "H-shaped" tungsten grid over the CFL X-ray detector. From measurements of the areas of the detector that are illuminated by the X-ray radiation, it is possible to retrieve the $(x,y)$ coordinates of the flare location on the solar disk. In this paper, we train a neural network on a dataset of real CFL observations to estimate the coordinates of solar flare locations. Further, we apply a post-training quantization technique specifically tailored to the adopted model architecture. This technique allows all computations to be in integer arithmetic at inference time, making the model compatible with the STIX computational requirements. We show that our model outperforms the currently adopted algorithm for estimating the flare locations from CFL data regarding prediction accuracy while requiring fewer parameters. We finally discuss possible future applications of the proposed model on-board STIX.

 - **Abstract**
 We present simultaneous X-ray polarimetric and spectral observations of the bright atoll source Ser~X-1 carried out with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), NICER, and NuSTAR. We obtain an upper limit of 2% (99% confidence level) on the polarization degree in the 2--8 keV energy band. We detect four type-I X-ray bursts, two of which during the IXPE observation. This is the first time that has IXPE observed type-I X-ray bursts, and it allows us to place an upper limit on their polarization degree; however, due to the limited total number of counts in each burst, we obtain a relatively high upper limit (80%). We confirm the presence of reflection features in the X-ray spectrum, notably a broad iron line. Fitting the data with a relativistic reflection model, we derive a disk inclination of 25 deg. The spectral and polarization properties are comparable with other atolls observed by IXPE, suggesting a similar accretion geometry, and the relatively low polarization is consistent with the low inclination.

          FRAM Next Generation at the Pierre Auger Observatory: cloud monitoring in the age of CMOS cameras

 - **Abstract**
 The visibility of stars is often used for cloud detection using all-sky cameras, which have however only a limited reach and resolution near the horizon due to the lack of detectable stars. At the Pierre Auger Observatory, it is also used by the current generation of FRAM robotic telescopes, but -- due to their limited field of view -- only for a small number of selected showers. Thanks to the recent development in astronomical CMOS cameras, we are able to propose a new type of device, specifically tailored to the field of view of the fluorescence detectors (FD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The sub-second readout times available with CMOS cameras allows the efficient use of short exposures, and so the field of view of one FD can be covered within half a minute with a resolution and reach sufficient to detect small clouds with a setup that is significantly smaller, simpler and cheaper than the current FRAMs. The FRAM Next Generation (framNG) device will be able not only to detect clouds, but also to assess their optical thickness, provide information on aerosol extinction, sky brightness and possibly even record atmospheric phenomena and astrophysical transients. The main challenge lies in the large data volume produced which necessitates reliable real-time data processing.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube neutrino observatory detects the diffuse astrophysical neutrino background with high significance, but the contribution of different classes of sources is not established. Because of their non-thermal spectrum, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are prime particle acceleration sites and one of the candidate classes for significant neutrino production. Exhaustive searches, based on stacking analysis of GRBs however could not establish the link between neutrinos and GRBs. Gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A had the highest time integrated gamma-ray flux of any detected GRB so far. The total fluence exceeds the sum of all Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) detected GRBs by a factor of two. Because it happened relatively nearby, it is one of the most favorable events for neutrino production from GRBs yet no neutrinos were detected. We calculate neutrino fluxes for this GRB in the TeV-PeV range using the most accurate, time-resolved spectral data covering the brightest intervals. We place limits on the physical parameters (Lorentz factor, baryon loading or emission radius) of the burst that are better by a factor of 2 compared to previous limits. The neutrino non-detection indicates a bulk Lorentz factor greater than 500 and possibly even 1000, consistent with other observations.
