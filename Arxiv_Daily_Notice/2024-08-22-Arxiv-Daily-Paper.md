 - **Abstract**
 In order to explore how the ubiquitous stochastic low-frequency (SLF) variability of O-type stars is related to various stellar characteristics, we compiled a sample of 150 O-type stars observed via ground-based spectroscopic surveys, alongside photometric data obtained from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We analyzed 298 light curves obtained from TESS sectors 1-65 for the stars in our sample. Leveraging the spectroscopic parameters, we used Bonnsai to determine masses, radii, fractional main sequence ages, and mass-loss rates for stars of our sample. Subsequently, we identified possible correlations between the fitted parameters of SLF variability and stellar properties. Our analysis unveiled four significant correlations between the amplitude and stellar parameters, including mass, radius, fractional main sequence ages, and mass-loss rate. For stars with $M \gtrsim 30 M_{\odot}$, we observed a decrease in characteristic frequency and steepness with increasing radius. Finally, we compared various physical processes that may account for the SLF variability with our results. The observed SLF variability may arise from the combined effects of FeCZ and IGWs, with IGWs potentially more dominant in the early stages of stellar evolution, and the contribution of FeCZ becoming more significant as stars evolve. Meanwhile, our results indicate that the SLF variability of O-type stars bears certain signatures of the line-driven wind instability and granulation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the most comprehensive and deepest X-ray study to date of the properties of the richest Wolf-Rayet (WR) population observed in a single stellar cluster, Westerlund 1 (Wd1). This work is based on 36 Chandra observations obtained from the "Extended Westerlund 1 and 2 Open Clusters Survey" (EWOCS) project, plus 8 archival Chandra observations. The overall exposure depth (~1.1 Ms) and baseline of the EWOCS observations extending over more than one year enable us to perform a detailed photometric, colour, and spectral analysis, as well as to search for short- and long-term periodicity. In X-rays, we detect 20 out of the 24 known Wolf-Rayet stars in Wd1 down to an observed luminosity of ~7$\times10^{29}$erg s$^{-1}$ (assuming a distance of 4.23 kpc to Wd1), with 8 WR stars being detected in X-rays for the first time. Nine stars show clear evidence of variability over the year-long baseline, with clear signs of periodicity. The X-ray colours and spectral analysis reveal that the vast majority of the WR stars are hard X-ray sources (kT$\geq$2.0keV). The Fe XXV emission line at ~6.7 keV, which commonly originates from the wind-wind collision zone in binary systems, is detected for the first time in the spectra of 17 WR stars in Wd1. In addition the ~6.4 keV fluorescent line is observed in the spectra of three stars, indicating that dense cold material coexists with the hot gas in these systems. Overall, our X-ray results alone suggest a very high binary fraction ($\geq$80%) for the WR star population in Wd1. When combining our results with properties of the WR population from other wavelengths, we estimate a binary fraction of $\geq$92%, which could even reach unity. This suggests that either all the most massive stars are found in binary systems within Wd1, or that binarity is essential for the formation of such a rich population of WR stars.

          High detection significance of the dark substructure in gravitational lens SDSSJ0946+1006 is revealed by image pixel supersampling

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies have shown that the dark substructure reported in the gravitational lens SDSSJ0946+1006 has a high central density which is in apparent tension with the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. However, the detection significance of the substructure has been found in Ballard et al. (2024) to be sensitive to the assumed prior on the smoothness of the source galaxy: a sufficiently noisy source allows for noise-level residuals even without including a subhalo in the model. Here we show that the detection significance of the substructure is higher than previously reported ($\Delta\ln Z \approx 143$, equivalent to a $\sim17\sigma$ detection) by approximating the integration of light over each pixel via ray tracing and averaging over many subpixels--a technique known as supersampling--and this result is insensitive to the assumed prior on the source galaxy smoothness. Assuming a dark matter subhalo, supersampling also tightens the subhalo constraints: we find that the subhalo's projected mass enclosed within 1 kpc lies within the range $(2.2-3.4)\times10^9M_\odot$ at the 95\% confidence level in our highest evidence model, while the log-slope of the subhalo's projected density profile at 1 kpc is steeper than $-1.75$ at the 95\% confidence level, further establishing it as an outlier compared to expectations from CDM. Supersampling also allows us to identify a systematic within the data that has biased the slope of the primary lensing galaxy's density profile in prior studies, which we speculate might be due to the presence of dust or an imperfect foreground subtraction. Our analysis places the existence of the substructure in SDSSJ0946+1006 on firmer ground, and should motivate deeper follow-up observations to better constrain the properties of this substructure and clarify the severity of its apparent tension with $\Lambda$CDM.

 - **Abstract**
 Kilonovae are key to advancing our understanding of r-process nucleosynthesis. To date, only two kilonovae have been spectroscopically observed, AT 2017gfo and AT 2023vfi. Here, we present an analysis of the James Webb Space Telescope spectra obtained +29 and +61 days post-merger for AT 2023vfi. After re-reducing and photometrically flux-calibrating the data, we empirically model the observed X-ray to mid-infrared continua with a power law and a blackbody, to replicate the non-thermal afterglow and apparent thermal continuum $\gtrsim 2 \, \mu$m. We fit Gaussians to the apparent emission features, obtaining line centroids of $20218_{-38}^{+37}$, $21874 \pm 89$ and $44168_{-152}^{+153}$\,Å, and velocity widths spanning $0.057 - 0.110$\,c. These line centroid constraints facilitated a detailed forbidden line identification search, from which we shortlist a number of r-process species spanning all three r-process peaks. We rule out Ba II and Ra II as candidates and propose Te I-III, Er I-III and W III as the most promising ions for further investigation, as they plausibly produce multiple emission features from one (W III) or multiple (Te I-III, Er I-III) ion stages. We compare to the spectra of AT 2017gfo, which also exhibit prominent emission at $\sim 2.1 \, \mu$m, and conclude that [Te III] $\lambda$21050 remains the most plausible cause of the observed $\sim 2.1 \, \mu$m emission in both kilonovae. However, the observed line centroids are not consistent between both objects, and they are significantly offset from [Te III] $\lambda$21050. The next strongest [Te III] transition at 29290\,Å is not observed, and we quantify its detectability. Further study is required, with particular emphasis on expanding the available atomic data to enable quantitative non-LTE spectral modelling.

 - **Abstract**
 Precise masses of red-giant stars enable a robust inference of their ages, but there are cases where these age estimates are highly precise yet very inaccurate. Examples are core-helium-burning (CHeB) stars that have lost more mass than predicted by standard single-star evolutionary models. Members of star clusters in the ${\it Kepler}$ database represent a unique opportunity to identify such stars, because they combine exquisite asteroseismic constraints with independent age information. In this work we focus on the single, metal-rich, Li-rich, low-mass, CHeB star KIC4937011, which is a member of the open cluster NGC 6819 (turn-off mass of $\approx 1.6 \, M_\odot$, i.e. age of $\approx 2.4$ Gyr). This star has $\approx 1 \, M_\odot$ less mass than expected for its age and metallicity, which could be explained by binary interactions or mass-loss along the red-giant branch (RGB). To infer formation scenarios for this object, we perform a Bayesian analysis by combining the binary stellar evolutionary framework $\texttt{binary_c v2.2.3}$ with the dynamic nested sampling approach contained in the $\texttt{dynesty v2.1.1}$ package. We find that this star is likely the result of a common-envelope evolution (CEE) phase during the RGB stage of the primary star in which the low-mass ($<0.71 \, M_\odot$) main sequence companion does not survive. During the CEE phase $\approx 1 \, M_\odot$ of material is ejected from the system, and the final star reaches the CHeB stage after helium flashes as if it were a single star of mass $\approx 0.7 \, M_\odot$, which is what we observe today. Although the proposed scenario is consistent with photometric and spectroscopic observations, a quantitative comparison with detailed stellar evolution calculations is needed to quantify the systematic skewness of radius, luminosity, and effective temperature distributions towards higher values than observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present GTC-OSIRIS phase-resolved optical spectroscopy of three compact binary MSPs, or `spiders': PSR J1048+2339, PSR J1810+1744, and (for the first time) PSR J1908+2105. For the companion in each system, the temperature is traced throughout its orbit, and radial velocities are measured. The radial velocities are found to vary with the absorption features used when measuring them, resulting in a lower radial velocity curve semi-amplitude measured from the day side of two of the systems when compared to the night: for J1048 ($K_\mathrm{day} = 344 \pm 4$ km s$^{-1}$, $K_\mathrm{night} = 372 \pm 3$ km s$^{-1}$) and, tentatively, for J1810 ($K_\mathrm{day} = 448 \pm 19$ km s$^{-1}$, $K_\mathrm{night} = 491 \pm 32$ km s$^{-1}$). With existing inclination constraints, this gives the neutron star (NS) and companion masses $M_\mathrm{NS} = 1.50 - 2.04$ $M_\odot$ and $M_2 = 0.32 - 0.40$ $M_\odot$ for J1048, and $M_\mathrm{NS} > 1.7$ $M_\odot$ and $M_2 = 0.05 - 0.08$ $M_\odot$ for J1810. For J1908, we find an upper limit of $K_2 < 32$ km s$^{-1}$, which constrains its mass ratio $q = M_2 / M_\mathrm{NS} > 0.55$ and inclination $i < 6.0^\circ$, revealing the previously misunderstood system to be the highest mass ratio, lowest inclination redback yet. This raises questions for the origins of its substantial radio eclipses. Additionally, we find evidence of asymmetric heating in J1048 and J1810, and signs of metal enrichment in J1908. We also explore the impact of inclination on spectroscopic temperatures, and demonstrate that the temperature measured at quadrature ($\phi = 0.25, 0.75$) is essentially independent of inclination, and thus can provide additional constraints on photometric modelling.

          Distinguishing between light curves of ellipsoidal variables with massive dark companions, contact binaries, and semidetached binaries using principal component analysis

 - **Abstract**
 Photometric methods for identifying dark companion binaries - binary systems hosting quiescent black holes and neutron stars - operate by detecting ellipsoidal variations caused by tidal interactions. The limitation of this approach is that contact and semidetached binaries can produce similarly looking light curves. In this work, we address the degeneracy of ellipsoidal light curves by studying the differences between synthetically generated light curves of dark companion, semidetached, and contact binary systems. We inject the light curves with various levels of uncorrelated and correlated Gaussian noise to simulate the effects of instrumental noise and stellar spots. Using principal component analysis (PCA) and Fourier decomposition, we construct low-dimensional representations of the light curves. We find that the first two to five PCA components are sufficient to explain $99\%$ of variance in the data. The PCA representations are generally more informative than the Fourier representation for the same number of coefficients as measured by both the silhouette scores of the representations and the macro recalls of random forest classifiers trained on the representations. The random forest classifiers reach macro recalls from $0.97$ to $0.70$, indicating that the classes remain largely separable even under adverse conditions. We find that instrumental noise significantly impacts the class separation only when its standard deviation exceeds $10^{-3}$ mag, whereas the presence of spots can markedly reduce the class separation even when they contribute as little as $1\%$ of the light curve amplitude. We discuss the application of our method to real ellipsoidal samples, and we show that we can increase the purity of a sample of dark companion candidates by a factor of up to $27$ if we assume a prior purity of $1\%$, significantly improving the cost-efficiency of follow-up observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Newly-computed collisional rate coefficients for the excitation of C$_2$ in collisions with H$_2$, presented recently by Najar and Kalugina (2020), are significantly larger than the values adopted previously in models for the excitation of the C$_2$ molecule, a widely used probe of the interstellar gas density. With these new rate coefficients, we have modeled the C$_2$ rotational distributions inferred from visible and ultraviolet absorption observations of electronic transitions of C$_2$ towards a collection of 46 nearby background sources. The inferred gas densities in the foreground interstellar clouds responsible for the observed C$_2$ absorption are a factor 4 to 7 smaller than those inferred previously, a direct reflection of the larger collisional rate coefficients computed by Najar and Kalugina (2020). These lower density estimates are generally in good agreement with the peak densities inferred from 3D extinction maps for the relevant sightlines. In cases where H$_3^+$ absorption has also been observed and used to estimate the cosmic-ray ionization rate (CRIR), our estimates of the latter will also decrease accordingly because the H$_3^+$ abundance is a function of the ratio of the CRIR to the gas density.

          First joint MUSE, HST, and JWST spectro-photometric analysis of the intracluster light: the case of the relaxed cluster RX J2129.7+0005

 - **Abstract**
 We present the most detailed spectrum of the intracluster light (ICL) in an individual cluster to date, the relaxed system RX J2129.7+0005, at $z\sim 0.234$. Using 15 broad-band, deep images observed with HST and JWST in the optical and the infrared, plus deep integral field spectroscopy from MUSE, we computed a total of 3696 ICL maps spanning the spectral range $\sim 0.4-5$ $\mu$m with our algorithm CICLE, a method that is extremely well suited to analyzing large samples of data in a fully automated way. We used both parametric and non-parametric approaches to fit the spectral energy distribution of the ICL and infer its physical properties, yielding a stellar mass $log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})$ between $11.5-12.7$ and an average age between $9.7-10.5$ Gyr, from CIGALE and Prospector results. This implies that the ICL in RX J2129.7+0005 is, on average, older than that of disturbed clusters, suggesting that the contribution from different stellar populations to the ICL are at play depending on the cluster's dynamical state. Coupled with X-ray observations of the hot gas distribution, we confirm the relaxed state of RX J2129.7+0005, showing clear signs of sloshing after a last major merger with a high-mass ratio satellite that could have happened $\sim 6.6$ Gyr ago in a relatively radial orbit. The presence of substructure in the ICL, such as shells, clouds with different densities and a certain degree of boxyness, and a clump, supports this scenario.

          Massive stellar triples on the edge: A numerical study of the evolution and final outcomes of destabilized massive triples

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars reside predominantly in triples or higher-order multiples. Their lives can be significantly affected by three-body interactions, making it an important area of study in the context of massive star evolution. In this study we provide a statistical overview of the lives and final outcomes of destabilized massive triples. A population of initially stable triples with a massive primary star are evolved from the zero-age main sequence using the code TRES, which combines stellar evolution with orbit-averaged dynamics. The triples that become unstable are transferred to a direct N-body code where they are simulated until the system disintegrates. This excludes systems undergoing mass transfer, such that the instability is caused by stellar winds or supernovae. Two suites of N-body simulations are performed; one with gravity as the only interaction, and one with stellar evolution included. We find that collisions occur in 35 - 40% of systems, with the variation coming from whether stellar evolution is included. The collisions mainly involve two main sequence stars (70 - 78%) or a main sequence and post-main sequence star (13 - 28%). We estimate a Galactic rate of collisions due to massive triple destabilization at 1.1 - 1.3 events per Myr. Furthermore, we find that the process of destabilization often ends in the ejection of one of the stellar bodies, specifically for 31 - 40% of systems. The ejected bodies have typical velocities of around 6 km/s, with a tail stretching to 102 km/s. If we assume that 20% of massive stars are runaway stars, then 0.1% of runaways originate from triple destabilization. Overall, our simulations show that triple instability affects approximately 2% of massive triples. However, we estimate that up to ten times as many systems can become unstable due to mass transfer in the inner binary, and these system may end up ejecting bodies at higher velocities.

 - **Abstract**
 Aerosol opacity has emerged as a critical factor controlling transmission and emission spectra. We provide a simple guideline for the effects of aerosol morphology on opacity and residence time in the atmosphere, as it pertains to transit observations, particularly those with flat spectra due to high altitude aerosols. This framework can be used for understanding complex cloud and haze particle properties before getting into detailed microphysical modeling. We consider high altitude aerosols to be composed of large fluffy particles that can have large residence times in the atmosphere and influence the deposition of stellar flux and/or the emergence of thermal emission in a different way than compact droplet particles, as generally modeled to date for extrasolar planetary atmospheres. We demonstrate the important influence of aggregate particle porosity and composition on the extent of the wavelength independent regime. We also consider how such fluffy particles reach such high altitudes and conclude that the most likely scenario is their local production at high altitudes via UV bombardment and subsequent blanketing of the atmosphere, rather than some mechanism of lofting or transport from the lower atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Building on previous works to construct a homogeneous sample of brown dwarfs in binary systems, we investigate microlensing events detected by the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) survey during the 2022 and 2023 seasons. Given the difficulty in distinguishing brown-dwarf events from those produced by binary lenses with nearly equal-mass components, we analyze all lensing events detected during the seasons that exhibit anomalies characteristic of binary-lens systems. Using the same criteria consistently applied in previous studies, we identify six additional brown dwarf candidates through the analysis of lensing events KMT-2022-BLG-0412, KMT-2022-BLG-2286, KMT-2023-BLG-0201, KMT-2023-BLG-0601, KMT-2023-BLG-1684, and KMT-2023-BLG-1743. An examination of the mass posteriors shows that the median mass of the lens companions ranges from 0.02 $M_\odot$ to 0.05 $M_\odot$, indicating that these companions fall within the brown-dwarf mass range. The mass of the primary lenses ranges from 0.11 $M_\odot$ to 0.68 $M_\odot$, indicating that they are low-mass stars with substantially lower masses compared to the Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the consequences of non-ideal chemical interaction between silicate and overlying hydrogen-rich envelopes for rocky planets using basic tenets of phase equilibria. Based on our current understanding of the temperature and pressure conditions for complete miscibility of silicate and hydrogen, we find that the silicate-hydrogen binary solvus will dictate the nature of atmospheres and internal layering in rocky planets that garnered H$_2$-rich primary atmospheres. The temperatures at the surfaces of supercritical magma oceans will correspond to the silicate-hydrogen solvus. As a result, the radial positions of supercritical magma ocean-atmosphere interfaces, rather than their temperatures and pressures, should reflect the thermal states of these planets. The conditions prescribed by the solvus influence the structure of the atmosphere, and thus the transit radii of sub-Neptunes. Separation of iron-rich metal to form metal cores in sub-Neptunes and super-Earths is not assured due to prospects for neutral buoyancy of metal in silicate melt induced by dissolution of H, Si, and O in the metal at high temperatures.

 - **Abstract**
 Low fluxes of astrophysical neutrinos at TeV energies and the overwhelming background of atmospheric neutrinos below that, render the current paradigm of neutrino astronomy as a severely statistics limited one. While many hints have emerged, all the evidence gathered by IceCube and ANTARES, over the course of almost a decade and a half of operation, have fallen short of providing any conclusive answer to the puzzle of the origin of high-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. The advancement of the field is thus closely associated with not only the neutrino observatories coming online in the next few years, but also on the coordinated efforts of the EM, GW and cosmic ray communities to develop dedicated channels and infrastructure that allows for swift and comprehensive multi-messenger follow-up of relevant events detected in any of the sectors. This paper highlights the strides that have been already taken in that direction and the fruits that they have born, as well as the challenges that lie ahead.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are astronomical radio transients of unknown origin. A minority of FRBs have been observed to originate from repeating sources, and it is unknown which apparent one-off bursts are hidden repeaters. Recent studies increasingly suggest that there are intrinsic physical differences between repeating and non-repeating FRBs. Previous research has used machine learning classification techniques to identify apparent non-repeaters with repeater characteristics, whose sky positions would be ideal targets for future observation campaigns. However, these methods have not sufficiently accounted for the positive and unlabelled (PU) nature of the data, wherein true labels are only available for repeaters. Modified techniques that do not inadvertently learn properties of hidden repeaters as characteristic of non-repeaters are likely to identify additional repeater candidates with greater accuracy. We present in this paper the first known attempt at applying PU-specific machine learning techniques to study FRBs. We train an ensemble of five PU-specific classifiers on the available data and use them to identify 66 repeater candidates in burst data from the CHIME/FRB collaboration, 18 of which were not identified with the use of machine learning classifiers in past research. Our results additionally support repeaters and non-repeaters having intrinsically different physical properties, particularly spectral index, frequency width, and burst width. This work additionally opens new possibilities to study repeating and non-repeating FRBs using the framework of PU learning.

 We present the initial data for the ($J = 3 \to 2$) transition of $^{13}$CO obtained from the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way as part of the CO Heterodyne Inner Milky Way Plane Survey 2 (CHIMPS2). Covering $359^\circ \leq l \leq 1^\circ$ and $|b| \leq 0.5^\circ$ with an angular resolution of 19 arcsec, velocity resolution of 1 km s$^{-1}$, and rms $T_A^* = 0.59$ K at these resolutions, our observations unveil the complex structure of the CMZ molecular gas in improved detail. Complemented by the $^{12}$CO CHIMPS2 data, we estimate a median optical depth of $\tau_{13} = 0.087$. The preliminary analysis yields a median $^{13}$CO column density range equal to $N(^{13}\text{CO})= 2$--$5 \times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$, median H$_2$ column density equal to $N(\text{H}_2)= 4 \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ to $1 \times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. We derive $N(\text{H}_2)$-based total mass estimates of $M(\text{H}_2)= 2$--$6 \times 10^7\, M_{\odot}$, in agreement with previous studies. We analyze the relationship between the integrated intensity of $^{13}$CO and the surface density of compact sources identified by Herschel Hi-GAL, and find that younger Hi-GAL sources detected at 500 $\mu$m but not at 70 $\mu$m follow the dense gas of the CMZ more closely than those that are bright at 70 $\mu$m. The latter, actively star-forming sources, appear to be more associated with material in the foreground spiral arms.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform new general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations for collapses of rotating supermassive star cores with an approximate nuclear burning up to carbon and a detailed equation of state. For all the models we investigate, the energy generation by nuclear burning plays only a minor role, leading to the formation of a black hole without a nuclear-powered explosion. For rotating models, however, the stellar explosion associated with shock heating is driven from a torus, which forms after the black hole formation. The explosion energy is up to $10^{-4}$ of the mass energy of the supermassive star cores ($\sim 10^{55}-10^{56}$ erg). We find that, even if we increase the rotational angular momentum of the progenitor, the ejecta mass saturates at $\sim 1$\% of the total mass of the initial stellar core. The average ejecta velocity also saturates at $\approx 20\%$ of the speed of light. As a result, the ejecta kinetic energy is approximately proportional to the initial mass of the supermassive star core for the rapidly rotating case. We also perform viscous hydrodynamics simulations for exploring the evolution of the remnant torus. Although the viscous heating drives an outflow from the torus, we find that its effect is subdominant in terms of the kinetic energy because of the small velocity ($\approx 0.07c$) of the ejecta component.

 - **Abstract**
 The dependence of the final fate of supermassive star (SMS) cores on their mass and angular momentum is studied with simple modeling. SMS cores in the hydrogen burning phase encounter the general relativistic instability during the stellar evolution if the mass is larger than $\sim 3 \times 10^4M_\odot$. Spherical SMS cores in the helium burning phase encounter the general relativistic instability prior to the onset of the electron-positron pair instability if the mass is larger than $\sim 1\times 10^4M_\odot$. For rapidly rotating SMS cores, these values for the threshold mass are enhanced by up to a factor of $\sim 5$, and thus, for SMSs with mass smaller than $\sim 10^4M_\odot$ the collapse is triggered by the pair-instability, irrespective of the rotation. After the onset of the general relativistic instability, SMS cores in the hydrogen burning phase with reasonable metallicity are likely to collapse to a black hole irrespective of the degree of rotation, whereas the SMS cores in the helium burning phase could explode via nuclear burning with no black hole formation, as previous works demonstrate.

          Survey of Complex Organic Molecules in Starless and Prestellar Cores in the Perseus Molecular Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 Cold ($\sim$10 K) and dense ($\sim$10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) cores of gas and dust within molecular clouds, known as starless and dynamically evolved prestellar cores, are the birthplaces of low-mass ($M$ $\leq$ few M$_\odot$) stars. As detections of interstellar complex organic molecules, or COMs, in starless cores has increased, abundance comparisons suggest that some COMs might be seeded early in the star formation process and inherited to later stages (i.e., protostellar disks and eventually comets). To date observations of COMs in starless cores have been limited, with most detections reported solely in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. It is therefore still a question whether different environments affect abundances. We have surveyed 35 starless and prestellar cores in the Perseus Molecular Cloud with the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) 12m telescope detecting both methanol, CH$_3$OH, and acetaldehyde, CH$_3$CHO, in 100% and 49% of the sample, respectively. In the sub-sample of 15 cores where CH$_3$CHO was detected at $>3\sigma$ ($\sim$18 mK) with the ARO 12m, follow-up observations with the Yebes 40m telescope were carried out. Detections of formic acid, $t$-HCOOH, ketene, H$_2$CCO, methyl cyanide, CH$_3$CN, vinyl cyanide, CH$_2$CHCN, methyl formate, HCOOCH$_3$, and dimethyl ether, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, are seen in at least $20\%$ of the cores. We discuss detection statistics, calculate column densities, and compare abundances across various stages of low-mass star formation. Our findings have more than doubled COM detection statistics in cold cores and show COMs are prevalent in the gas before star and planet formation in the Perseus Molecular Cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We aim to study chemically peculiar Am and Fm stars, distinguished by their unique abundance patterns, which are crucial for studying mixing processes in intermediate-mass stars. These stars provide a window into the atomic diffusion in their stellar envelopes, the evolution-dependent changes in mixing, and the resulting effects on pulsation mechanisms. Methods. This study examines the pulsation characteristics of the Am/Fm star group. Our analysis encompasses 1276 stars (available as catalogues on GitHub), utilising data from TESS and Gaia and focusing on stars from the Renson catalogue. Results. In our sample, 51% (649 stars) display no variability, thus categorised as constant stars. Among the remaining, 25% (318 stars) are pulsating Am/Fm and {\rho} Puppis stars, including 20% (261 stars) that are exclusively Am/Fm stars. Additionally, 17% (210 stars) show variability indicative of binarity and/or rotational modulation and 7% (93 stars) are eclipsing binaries. Of the pulsating stars, 10% (32 stars) are {\gamma} Doradus type, 54% (172 stars) {\delta} Scuti type, and 36% (114 stars) are hybrids, underlining a diverse pulsational behaviour of Am/Fm stars. Conclusions. Our findings indicate that pulsating stars predominantly occupy positions near the red edge of the classical instability strip, allowing us to ascertain the incidence of pulsations in this stellar population.

 - **Abstract**
 We report JWST MIRI MRS observations of the $\beta$ Pictoris moving group member, $\eta$ Telescopii ($\eta$ Tel) A and its brown dwarf binary companion, $\eta$ Tel B. Following PSF subtraction, we recover the spatially resolved flux from the debris disk around $\eta$ Tel A, along with the position of the companion exterior to the disk. We present a new 5-26 $\mu$m epoch of spectroscopy for the disk, in which we discover a 20 $\mu$m silicate feature. We also present the first ever 11-21 $\mu$m spectrum of $\eta$ Tel B, which indicates a bare photosphere. We derive a new epoch of relative astrometry for the companion, extending the baseline of measurements to 25 years, and find that its current location is consistent with the apocentre of an eccentric, long-period orbit. The companion's orbit is close enough to the disk that it should significantly perturb the planetesimals within it, resulting in a detectable mid-IR pericentre glow and near-alignment with the companion. Contrary to expectations, however, we find that the disk appears to be axisymmetric and potentially misaligned with the companion in the MIRI MRS data. We posit that this may be due to the presence of an additional, yet-undetected 0.7-30 $M_J$ planet orbiting interior to the disk with a semi-major axis of 3-19 au.

 - **Abstract**
 The outcome of the formation of massive stars is an important anchor point in their evolution. It provides insight into the physics of the assembly process, and sets the conditions for stellar evolution. We characterize a population of 18 highly reddened O4.5 to B9 stars in the very young massive star-forming region M17. Their properties allow us to identify the empirical location of the ZAMS, and rotation and mass-loss rate of stars there. We performed quantitative spectroscopic modeling of VLT/X-shooter spectra using NLTE atmosphere code Fastwind and fitting approach Kiwi-GA. The observed SEDs were used to determine the line-of-sight extinction. From a comparison of their positions in the HRD with MIST evolutionary tracks, we inferred the stellar masses and ages. We find an age of $0.4_{-0.2}^{+0.6}$ Myr for our sample, however we also identify a strong relation between the age and the mass of the stars. The extinction towards the sources ranges from $A_V = 3.6$ to 10.6. Stars more massive than 10 M$_{\odot}$ have reached the ZAMS. Their projected ZAMS spin rate distribution extends to 0.3 of the critical velocity; their mass-loss rates agree with those of other main-sequence OB stars. Stars with a mass in the range $3 < M/$M$_{\odot} < 7$ are still on the pre-main sequence (PMS). Evolving their $v \sin i$ to the ZAMS yields values up to $\sim 0.6 v_{\rm crit}$. For PMS stars without disks, we find tentative mass-loss rates up to $10^{-8.5}\,$M$_{\odot}$\,yr$^{-1}$. We constrain the empirical location of the ZAMS for massive ($10 < M/$M$_{\odot} < 50$) stars. The ZAMS rotation rates for intermediate-mass stars are twice as high as for massive stars, suggesting that the angular momentum gain processes differ between the two groups. The relation between the age and mass of the stars suggests a lag in the formation of more massive stars relative to lower mass stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The transit technique has been very efficient in detecting planet candidate signals over the past decades. The so-called statistical validation approach has become a popular way of verifying a candidate's planetary nature. However, the incomplete consideration of false positive scenarios and data quality can lead to the misinterpretation of the results. In this work we revise the planetary status of K2-399\,b, a validated planet with an estimated false positive probability of 0.078% located in the middle of the so-called Neptunian desert, and hence a potential key target for atmospheric prospects. We use radial velocity data from the CARMENES, HARPS and TRES spectrographs, as well as ground-based multi-band transit photometry LCOGT MuSCAT3 and broad band photometry to test the planetary scenario. Our analysis of the available data does not support the existence of this (otherwise key) planet, and instead points to a scenario composed of an early G-dwarf orbited in a $846.62^{+0.22}_{-0.28}$~days period by a pair of eclipsing M-dwarfs (hence a hierarchical eclipsing binary) likely in the mid-type domain. We thus demote K2-399 b as a planet. We conclude that the validation process, while very useful to prioritise follow-up efforts, must always be conducted with careful attention to data quality while ensuring that all possible scenarios have been properly tested to get reliable results. We also encourage developers of validation algorithms to ensure the accuracy of a priori probabilities for different stellar scenarios that can lead to this kind of false validation. We further encourage the use of follow-up observations when possible (such as radial velocity and/or multi-band light curves) to confirm the planetary nature of detected transiting signals rather than only relying on validation tools.

          Modeling multiband SEDs and light curves of BL Lacertae using a time-dependent shock-in-jet model

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of fast flux variability in blazars is a long-standing problem, with many theoretical models proposed to explain it. In this study, we focus on BL Lacertae to model its spectral energy distribution (SED) and broadband light curves using a diffusive shock acceleration process involving multiple mildly relativistic shocks, coupled with a time-dependent radiation transfer code. BL Lacertae was the target of a comprehensive multiwavelength monitoring campaign in early July 2021. We present a detailed investigation of the source's broadband spectral and light curve features using simultaneous observations at optical-UV frequencies with Swift-UVOT, in X-rays with Swift-XRT and AstroSat-SXT/LAXPC, and in gamma-rays with Fermi-LAT, covering the period from July to August 2021 (MJD 59400 to 59450). A fractional variability analysis shows that the source is most variable in gamma-rays, followed by X-rays, UV, and optical. This allowed us to determine the fastest variability time in gamma-rays to be on the order of a few hours. The AstroSat-SXT and LAXPC light curves indicate X-ray variability on the order of a few kiloseconds. Modeling simultaneously the SEDs of low and high flux states of the source and the multiband light curves provided insights into the particle acceleration mechanisms at play. This is the first instance of a physical model that accurately captures the multi-band temporal variability of BL Lacertae, including the hour-scale fluctuations observed during the flare.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the effects of relaxing the assumption that gravitational waves composing the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) are uncorrelated between frequencies in analyses of the data from Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). While individual monochromatic plane waves are often a good approximation, a background composed of astrophysical sources cannot be monochromatic since an infinite plane wave carries no signal. We consider how relaxing this assumption allows us to extract potential information about modified dispersion relations and other fundamental physics questions, as both the group and phase velocity of waves become relevant. After developing the formalism we carry out simple Gaussian wavepacket examples and then consider more realistic waveforms, such as that from binary inspirals. When the frequency evolves only slowly across the PTA temporal baseline, the monochromatic assumption at an effective mean frequency remains a good approximation and we provide scaling relations that characterize its accuracy.

          Chemical models of interstellar glycine and adenine precursor aminoacetonitrile (NH2CH2CN)

 - **Abstract**
 Aminoacetonitrile (AAN), also known as glycinenitrile, has been suggested as a possible precursor of glycine and adenine in the interstellar medium. Here we present the chemical modeling of AAN and its isomers in hot cores using the three-phase chemical model NAUTILUS with the addition of over 300 chemical reactions of the three AAN isomers and related species. Our models predicted a peak gas phase abundance of AAN reaching the order of 10-8, which is consistent with observation towards Sgr B2(N). Regarding the reaction pathways of AAN and its isomers, we found that AAN is primarily formed via free radical reactions on grain surfaces during the early evolutionary stages. Subsequently, it is thermally desorbed into the gas phase as the temperature rises and is then destroyed by positive ions and radicals in gas phase. The isomers of AAN are formed through the hydrogenation reaction of CH3NCN on the grain surface and via electron recombination reactions of ion C2H5N2+ in gas phase. We speculate that there is a possibility for NCCN and AAN to react with each other, eventually leading to the formation of adenine in hot cores. However, further investigation is required to understand the efficiency of grain surfaces in adenine formation, through theoretical calculations or laboratory experiments in future research.
