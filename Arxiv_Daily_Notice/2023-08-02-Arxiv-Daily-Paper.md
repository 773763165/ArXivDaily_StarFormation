#### Mapping out the parameter space for photoevaporation and core-powered  mass-loss

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding atmospheric escape in close-in exoplanets is critical to interpreting their evolution. We map out the parameter space over which photoevaporation and core-powered mass loss dominate atmospheric escape. Generally, the transition between the two regimes is determined by the location of the Bondi radius (i.e. the sonic point of core-powered outflow) relative to the penetration depth of XUV photons. Photoevaporation dominates the loss when the XUV penetration depth lies inside the Bondi radius ($R_{XUV}<R_B$) and core-powered mass-loss when XUV radiation is absorbed higher up in the flow ($R_B<R_{XUV}$). The transition between the two regimes occurs at a roughly constant ratio of the planet's radius to its Bondi radius, with the exact value depending logarithmically on planetary and stellar properties. In general, core-powered mass-loss dominates for lower-gravity planets with higher equilibrium temperatures, and photoevaporation dominates for higher-gravity planets with lower equilibrium temperatures. However, planets can transition between these two mass-loss regimes during their evolution, and core-powered mass loss can ``enhance'' photo-evaporation over a significant region of parameter space. Interestingly, a planet that is ultimately stripped by core-powered mass-loss has likely only ever experienced core-powered mass-loss. In contrast a planet that is ultimately stripped by photoevaporation could have experienced an early phase of core-powered mass-loss. Applying our results to the observed super-Earth population suggests that it contains significant fractions of planets where each mechanism controlled the final removal of the H/He envelope, although photoevaporation appears to be responsible for the final carving of the exoplanet radius-valley.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of the eclipsing double white dwarf (WD) binary WDJ 022558.21-692025.38 that has an orbital period of 47.19 min. Following identification with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we obtained time-series ground based spectroscopy and high-speed multi-band ULTRACAM photometry which indicate a primary DA WD of mass 0.40 +- 0.04 Msol and a 0.28 +- 0.02 Msol mass secondary WD, which is likely of type DA as well. The system becomes the third-closest eclipsing double WD binary discovered with a distance of approximately 400 pc and will be a detectable source for upcoming gravitational wave detectors in the mHz frequency range. Its orbital decay will be measurable photometrically within 10 yrs to a precision of better than 1%. The fate of the binary is to merge in approximately 41 Myr, likely forming a single, more massive WD.

 - **Abstract**
 The lower energy peak of the spectral energy distribution of blazars has commonly been ascribed to synchrotron radiation from relativistic particles in the jets. Despite the consensus regarding jet emission processes, the particle acceleration mechanism is still debated. Here, we present the first X-ray polarization observations of PG 1553+113, a high-synchrotron-peak blazar observed by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). We detect an X-ray polarization degree of $(10\pm2)\%$ along an electric-vector position angle of $\psi_X=86^{\circ}\pm8^{\circ}$. At the same time, the radio and optical polarization degrees are lower by a factor of $\sim$3. During our IXPE pointing, we observed the first orphan optical polarization swing of the IXPE era, as the optical angle of PG 1553+113 underwent a smooth monotonic rotation by about 125$^\circ$, with a rate of $\sim$17 degrees per day. We do not find evidence of a similar rotation in either radio or X-rays, which suggests that the X-ray and optically emitting regions are separate or, at most, partially co-spatial. Our spectro-polarimetric results provide further evidence that the steady-state X-ray emission in blazars originates in a shock-accelerated and energy-stratified electron population.

 - **Abstract**
 Techniques to retrieve the atmospheric properties of exoplanets via direct observation of their reflected light have often been limited in scope due to computational constraints imposed by the forward-model calculations. We have developed a new set of techniques which significantly decreases the time required to perform a retrieval while maintaining accurate results. We constructed a grid of 1.4 million pre-computed geometric albedo spectra valued at discrete sets of parameter points. Spectra from this grid are used to produce models for a fast and efficient nested sampling routine called PSGnest. Beyond the upfront time to construct a spectral grid, the amount of time to complete a full retrieval using PSGnest is on the order of seconds to minutes using a personal computer. An extensive evaluation of the error induced from interpolating intermediate spectra from the grid indicates that this bias is insignificant compared to other retrieval error sources, with an average coefficient of determination between interpolated and true spectra of 0.998. We apply these new retrieval techniques to help constrain the optimal bandpass centers for retrieving various atmospheric and bulk parameters from a LuvEx-type mission observing several planetary archetypes. We show that spectral observations made using a 20\% bandpass centered at 0.73 microns can be used alongside our new techniques to make detections of $H_2O$ and $O_2$ without the need to increase observing time beyond what is necessary for a signal-to-noise ratio of 10. The methods introduced here will enable robust studies of the capabilities of future observatories to characterize exoplanets.
#### Signal Synchronization Strategies and Time Domain SETI with Gaia DR3

 - **Abstract**
 Spatiotemporal techniques for signal coordination with actively transmitting extraterrestrial civilizations, without the need for prior communication, can constrain technosignature searches to a significantly smaller coordinate space. With the variable star catalog from Gaia Data Release 3, we explore two related signaling strategies: the SETI Ellipsoid, and that proposed by Seto, which are both based on the synchronization of transmissions with a conspicuous astrophysical event. This dataset contains more than 10 million variable star candidates with light curves from the first three years of Gaia's operational phase, between 2014 and 2017. Using four different historical supernovae as source events, we find that less than 0.01% of stars in the sample have crossing times, the times at which we would expect to receive synchronized signals on Earth, within the date range of available Gaia observations. For these stars, we present a framework for technosignature analysis that searches for modulations in the variability parameters by splitting the stellar light curve at the crossing time.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave signal offers a promising window into the dynamics of the early universe. The recent results from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) could be the first glimpse of such new physics. In particular, they could point to new details during the inflation, which can not be probed by other means. We explore the possibility that the new results could come from the secondary gravitational wave sourced by curvature perturbations, generated by a first-order phase transition during the inflation. Based on the results of a field-theoretic lattice simulation of the phase transition process, we show that the gravitational wave signal generated through this mechanism can account for the new results from the PTAs. We analyze the spectral shape of the signal in detail. Future observations can use such information to distinguish the gravitational wave signal considered here from other possible sources.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the detection of 661 known pulsars observed with the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope at 888 MHz as a part of the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS). Detections were made through astrometric coincidence and we estimate the false alarm rate of our sample to be ~0.5%. Using archival data at 400 and 1400 MHz, we estimate the power law spectral indices for the pulsars in our sample and find that the mean spectral index is -1.78 +/- 0.6. However, we also find that a single power law is inadequate to model all the observed spectra. With the addition of the flux densities between 150 MHz and 3 GHz from various imaging surveys, we find that up to 40% of our sample shows deviations from a simple power law model. Using Stokes V measurements from the RACS data, we measured the circular polarization fraction for 9% of our sample and find that the mean polarization fraction is ~10% (consistent between detections and upper limits). Using the dispersion measure (DM) derived distance we estimate the pseudo luminosity of the pulsars and do not find any strong evidence for a correlation with the pulsars' intrinsic properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Time-domain observations are increasingly important in astronomy, and are often the only way to study certain objects. The volume of time-series data is increasing dramatically as new surveys come online - for example, the Vera Rubin Observatory will produce 15 terabytes of data per night, and its Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to produce five-year lightcurves for $>10^7$ sources, each consisting of 5 photometric bands. Historically, astronomers have worked with Fourier-based techniques such as the Lomb-Scargle periodogram or information-theoretic approaches; however, in recent years Bayesian and data-driven approaches such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) have gained traction. However, the computational complexity and steep learning curve of GPR has limited its adoption. `pgmuvi` makes GPR of multi-band timeseries accessible to astronomers by building on cutting-edge open-source machine-learning libraries, and hence `pgmuvi` retains the speed and flexibility of GPR while being easy to use. It provides easy access to GPU acceleration and Bayesian inference of the hyperparameters (e.g. the periods), and is able to scale to large datasets.
#### On the effects of mirror birefringence and its fluctuations to laser  interferometric gravitational wave detectors

 - **Abstract**
 Crystalline materials are promising candidates as substrates or high-reflective coatings of mirrors to reduce thermal noises in future laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors. However, birefringence of such materials could degrade the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors, not only because it can introduce optical losses, but also because its fluctuations create extra phase noise in the arm cavity reflected beam. In this paper, we analytically estimate the effects of birefringence and its fluctuations in the mirror substrate and coating for gravitational wave detectors. Our calculations show that the requirements for the birefringence fluctuations in silicon substrate and AlGaAs coating will be in the order of $10^{-8}$ rad/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ and $10^{-10}$ rad/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ at 100~Hz, respectively, for future gravitational wave detectors. We also point out that optical cavity response needs to be carefully taken into account to estimate optical losses from depolarization.
#### Signatures of a spinning supermassive black hole binary on the mas-scale  jet of the quasar S5 1928+738 based on 25 years of VLBI data

 - **Abstract**
 In a previous work, we have identified for the first time the spin of the dominant black hole of a binary from its jet properties. Analysing Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of the quasar S5 1928+738, taken at $15$ GHz during $43$ epochs between $1995.96$ and $2013.06$, we showed that the inclination angle variation of the inner ($<2$ mas) jet symmetry axis naturally decomposes into a periodic and a monotonic contribution. The former emerges due to the Keplerian orbital evolution, while the latter is interpreted as the signature of the spin-orbit precession of the jet emitting black hole. In this paper, we revisit the analysis of the quasar S5 1928+738 by including new $15$ GHz VLBA observations extending over $29$ additional epochs, between $2013.34$ and $2020.89$. The extended data set confirms our previous findings which are further supported by the flux density variation of the jet. By applying an enhanced jet precession model that can handle arbitrary spin orientations $\kappa$ with respect to the orbital angular momentum of a binary supermassive black hole system, we estimate the binary mass ratio as $\nu=0.21\pm0.04$ for $\kappa=0$ (i.e. when the spin direction is perpendicular to the orbital plane) and as $\nu=0.32\pm0.07$ for $\kappa=\pi/2$ (i.e. when the spin lies in the orbital plane). We estimate more precisely the spin precession velocity, cutting half of its uncertainty from $(-0.05\pm0.02)^\mathrm{o} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ to $(-0.04\pm0.01)^\mathrm{o} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The planned in-ice radio array of IceCube-Gen2 at the South Pole will provide unprecedented sensitivity to ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos in the EeV range. The ability of the detector to measure the neutrino's energy and direction is of crucial importance. This contribution presents an end-to-end reconstruction of both of these quantities for both detector components of the hybrid radio array ('shallow' and 'deep') using deep neural networks (DNNs). We are able to predict the neutrino's direction and energy precisely for all event topologies, including the electron neutrino charged-current interactions, which are more complex due to the LPM effect. This highlights the advantages of DNNs for modeling the complex correlations in radio detector data, thereby enabling a measurement of the neutrino energy and direction. We discuss how we can use normalizing flows to predict the PDF for each individual event which allows modeling the complex non-Gaussian uncertainty contours of the reconstructed neutrino direction. Finally, we discuss how this work can be used to further optimize the detector layout to improve its reconstruction performance.
#### Measurement of the astrophysical diffuse neutrino flux in a combined fit  of IceCube's high energy neutrino data

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has discovered a diffuse neutrino flux of astrophysical origin and measures its properties in various detection channels. With more than 10 years of data, we use multiple data samples from different detection channels for a combined fit of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino spectrum. This leverages the complementary information of different neutrino event signatures. For the first time, we use a coherent modelling of the signal and background, as well as the detector response and corresponding systematic uncertainties. The detector response is continuously varied during the simulation in order to generate a general purpose Monte Carlo set, which is central to our approach. We present a combined fit yielding a measurement of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux properties with unprecedented precision.
#### The Mass Fractionation of Helium in the Escaping Atmosphere of HD  209458b

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.00283
 - **Abstract**
 The absorption signals of metastable He in HD 209458b and several other exoplanets can be explained via escaping atmosphere model with a subsolar He/H ratio. The low abundance of helium can be a result of planet formation if there is a small amount of helium in their primordial atmosphere. However, another possibility is that the low He/H ratio is caused by the process of mass fractionation of helium in the atmosphere. In order to investigate the effect of the fractionation in the hydrogen-helium atmosphere, we developed a self-consistent multi-fluid 1D hydrodynamic model based on the well-known open-source MHD code PLUTO. Our simulations show that a lower He/H ratio can be produced spontaneously in the multi-fluid model. We further modeled the transmission spectra of He 10830 lines for HD 209458b in a broad parameter space. The transmission spectrum of the observation can be fitted in the condition of 1.80 times the X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet flux of the quiet Sun. Meanwhile, the ratio of the escaping flux of helium to hydrogen, $F_{He}/F_{H}$, is 0.039. Our results indicate that the mass fractionation of helium to hydrogen can naturally interpret the low He/H ratio required by the observation. Thus, in the escaping atmosphere of HD 209458b, decreasing the abundance of helium in the atmosphere is not needed even if its He abundance is similar to that of the Sun. The simulation presented in this work hints that in the escaping atmosphere, mass fractionation can also occur on other exoplanets, which needs to be explored further.

 - **Abstract**
 The volume of research on fast radio bursts (FRBs) observation have been seeing a dramatic growth. To facilitate the systematic analysis of the FRB population, we established a database platform, Blinkverse (https://blinkverse.alkaidos.cn), as a central inventory of FRBs from various observatories and with published properties, particularly dynamic spectra from FAST, CHIME, GBT, Arecibo, etc. Blinkverse thus not only forms a superset of FRBCAT, TNS, and CHIME/FRB, but also provides convenient access to thousands of FRB dynamic spectra from FAST, some of which were not available before. Blinkverse is regularly maintained and will be updated by external users in the future. Data entries of FRBs can be retrieved through parameter searches through FRB location, fluence, etc., and their logical combinations. Interactive visualization was built into the platform. We analyzed the energy distribution, period analysis, and classification of FRBs based on data downloaded from Blinkverse. The energy distributions of repeaters and non-repeaters are found to be distinct from one another.
#### Oxygen-bearing organic molecules in comet 67P's dusty coma: first  evidence for abundant heterocycles

 - **Abstract**
 The puzzling complexity of terrestrial biomolecules is driving the search for complex organic molecules in the Interstellar Medium (ISM) and serves as a motivation for many in situ studies of reservoirs of extraterrestrial organics from meteorites and interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) to comets and asteroids. Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) -- the best-studied comet to date -- has been visited and accompanied for two years by the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft. Around 67P's perihelion and under dusty conditions, the high-resolution mass spectrometer on board provided a spectacular glimpse into this comet's chemical complexity. For this work, we analyzed in unprecedented detail the O-bearing organic volatiles. In a comparison of 67P's inventory to molecules detected in the ISM, in other comets, and in Soluble Organic Matter (SOM) extracted from the Murchison meteorite, we also highlight the (pre)biotic relevance of different chemical groups of species. We report first evidence for abundant extraterrestrial O-bearing heterocycles (with abundances relative to methanol often on the order of 10% with a relative error margin of 30-50%) and various representatives of other molecule classes such as carboxylic acids and esters, aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols. Like with the pure hydrocarbons, some hydrogenated forms seem to be dominant over their dehydrogenated counterparts. An interesting example is tetrahydrofuran (THF) as it might be a more promising candidate for searches in the ISM than the long-sought furan itself. Our findings not only support and guide future efforts to investigate the origins of chemical complexity in space, but also they strongly encourage studies of, e.g., the ratios of unbranched vs. branched and hydrogenated vs. dehydrogenated species in astrophysical ice analogs in the laboratory as well as by modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole X-ray binaries are ideal environments to study the accretion phenomena in strong gravitational potentials. These systems undergo dramatic accretion state transitions and analysis of the X-ray spectra is used to probe the properties of the accretion disc and its evolution. In this work, we present a systematic investigation of $\sim$1800 spectra obtained by RXTE PCA observations of GRO J1655-40 and LMC X-3 to explore the nature of the accretion disc via non-relativistic and relativistic disc models describing the thermal emission in black-hole X-ray binaries. We demonstrate that the non-relativistic modelling throughout an outburst with the phenomenological multi-colour disc model DISKBB yields significantly lower and often unphysical inner disc radii and correspondingly higher ($\sim$50-60\%) disc temperatures compared to its relativistic counterparts KYNBB and KERRBB. We obtained the dimensionless spin parameters of $a_{*}=0.774 \pm 0.069 $ and $a_{*}=0.752 \pm 0.061 $ for GRO J1655-40 with KERRBB and KYNBB, respectively. We report a spin value of $a_{*}=0.098 \pm 0.063$ for LMC X-3 using the updated black hole mass of 6.98 ${M_{\odot}}$. Both measurements are consistent with the previous studies. Using our results, we highlight the importance of self-consistent modelling of the thermal emission, especially when estimating the spin with the continuum-fitting method which assumes the disc terminates at the innermost stable circular orbit at all times.
#### Prompt Gamma-Ray Burst Emission from Internal Shocks -- New Insights

 - **Abstract**
 Internal shocks are a leading candidate for the dissipation mechanism that powers the prompt $\gamma$-ray emission in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this scenario a compact central source produces an ultra-relativistic outflow with varying speeds, causing faster parts or shells to collide with slower ones. Each collision produces a pair of shocks -- a forward shock (FS) propagating into the slower leading shell and a reverse shock (RS) propagating into the faster trailing shell. The RS's lab-frame speed is always smaller, while the RS is typically stronger than the FS, leading to different conditions in the two shocked regions that both contribute to the observed emission. We show that optically-thin synchrotron emission from both (weaker FS + stronger RS) can naturally explain key features of prompt GRB emission such as the pulse shapes, time-evolution of the $\nu{}F_\nu$ peak flux and photon-energy, and the spectrum. Particularly, it can account for two features commonly observed in GRB spectra: (i) a sub-dominant low-energy spectral component (often interpreted as ``photospheric''-like), or (ii) a doubly-broken power-law spectrum with the low-energy spectral slope approaching the slow cooling limit. Both features can be obtained while maintaining high overall radiative efficiency without any fine-tuning of the physical conditions.
#### Convergence of halo statistics: code comparison between Rockstar and  CompaSO using scale-free simulations

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we perform a halo-finder code comparison between Rockstar and CompaSO. Based on our previous analysis aiming at quantifying resolution of $N$-body simulations by exploiting large (up to $N=4096^3$) simulations of scale-free cosmologies run using Abacus, we focus on convergence of the HMF, 2PCF and mean radial pairwise velocities of halo centres selected with the aforementioned two algorithms. We establish convergence, for both Rockstar and CompaSO, of mass functions at the $1\%$ precision level and of the mean pairwise velocities (and also 2PCF) at the $2\%$ level. At small scales and small masses, we find that Rockstar exhibits greater self-similarity, and we also highlight the role played by the merger-tree post-processing of CompaSO halos on their convergence. Finally, we give resolution limits expressed as a minimum particle number per halo in a form that can be directly extrapolated to LCDM.

 - **Abstract**
 Investigating the extinction properties in dense molecular clouds is of significant importance for understanding the behavior of interstellar dust and its impact on observations. In this study, we comprehensively examined the extinction law in the Ophiuchus cloud across a wavelength range from 0.8$\,\mu\rm m$ to 8$\,\mu\rm m$. To achieve this, we analyzed NIR and MIR data obtained from the UKIDSS GCS and the Spitzer c2d survey, respectively. By fitting a series of color-color diagrams, we determined color-excess ratios $E_{J-\lambda}/E_{J-K}$ for seven passbands. These ratios were then directly converted to derive the relative extinction law $A_\lambda/A_K$. Our findings demonstrate that the Ophiuchus cloud exhibits a characteristic of flat MIR extinction, consistent with previous studies. Additionally, our results reveal variations in the extinction law with extinction depth, indicating a flatter trend from the NIR to MIR bands as extinction increases. Notably, our analysis reveals no significant difference in the MIR extinction law among the four dark clouds: L1712, L1689, L1709, and L1688. However, distinct variations were observed in the extinction law for regions outside the dark clouds, specifically L1688N and L1688W. These regions displayed lower color-excess ratios $E_{J-\lambda}/E_{J-K}$ in the Spitzer/IRAC bands. This observation lends support to the dust growth occurring in the dense regions of the Ophiuchus cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Lunar impact flash (LIF) observations typically occur in R, I, or unfiltered light, and are only possible during night, targeting the night side of a 10-60% illumination Moon, while >10{\deg} above the observers horizon. This severely limits the potential to observe, and therefore the number of lower occurrence, high energy impacts observed is reduced. By shifting from the typically used wavelengths to the J-Band Short-Wave Infrared, the greater spectral radiance for the most common temperature (2750 K) of LIFs and darker skies at these wavelengths enables LIF monitoring to occur during the daytime, and at greater lunar illumination phases than currently possible. Using a 40.0 cm f/4.5 Newtonian reflector with Ninox 640SU camera and J-band filter, we observed several stars and lunar nightside at various times to assess the theoretical limits of the system. We then performed LIF observations during both day and night to maximise the chances of observing a confirmed LIF to verify the methods. We detected 61 >5{\sigma} events, from which 33 candidate LIF events could not be discounted as false positives. One event was confirmed by multi-frame detection, and by independent observers observing in visible light. While this LIF was observed during the night, the observed signal can be used to calculate the equivalent Signal-to-Noise ratio for a similar daytime event. The threshold for daylight LIF detection was found to be between Jmag=+3.4+-0.18 and Jmag=+5.6+-0.18 (Vmag=+4.5 and Vmag=+6.7 respectively at 2750 K). This represents an increase in opportunity to observe LIFs by almost 500%.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of observations of complex powerful type II burst associated with narrow Earth-directed CME, which was ejected at around 11 UT on 31 May 2013. The observations were performed by radio telescope UTR-2, which operated as local interferometer, providing the possibility of detection of the spatial parameters of the radio emission source. There are also polarization data from URAN-2 radio telescope. The CME was detected by two space-born coronagraphs SOHO/LASCO/C2 and STEREO/COR1-BEHIND, and was absolutely invisible for STEREO-AHEAD spacecraft. The associated type II burst consisted of two successive parts of quite different appearance on the dynamic spectrum. The first burst was narrow in frequency, had cloudy structure and was completely unpolarized while the second one represented rich herring-bone structure and exposed high degree of circular polarization. Both parts of the whole event reveal band splitting and well distinguished harmonic structure. The positions and sizes of the sources of the type II burst were found using cross-correlation functions of interferometer bases. The sources of the type II bursts elements were found to be of about 15 arcmin in size in average, with the smallest ones reaching as low as 10 arcmin. Corresponding brightness temperatures were estimated. In most cases these temperatures were between $10^{11}$ and $10^{12}$ K with maximum value as high as $10^{14}$ K. The spatial displacement of the source was measured and model independent velocities of the type II burst sources were determined.

 - **Abstract**
 Earth-like planets orbiting M-dwarf stars, M-Earths, are currently the best targets to search for signatures of life. Life as we know it requires water. The habitability of M-Earths is jeopardized by water loss to space: high flux from young M-dwarf stars can drive the loss of 3--20 Earth oceans from otherwise habitable planets. We develop a 0-D box model for Earth-mass terrestrial exoplanets, orbiting within the habitable zone, which tracks water loss to space and exchange between reservoirs during an early surface magma ocean phase and the longer deep-water cycling phase. A key feature is the duration of the surface magma ocean, assumed concurrent with the runaway greenhouse. This timescale can discriminate between desiccated planets, planets with desiccated mantles but substantial surface water, and planets with significant water sequestered in the mantle. A longer-lived surface magma ocean helps M-Earths retain water: dissolution of water in the magma provides a barrier against significant loss to space during the earliest, most active stage of the host M-dwarf, depending on the water saturation limit of the magma. Although a short-lived basal magma ocean can be beneficial to surface habitability, a long-lived basal magma ocean may sequester significant water in the mantle at the detriment of surface habitability. We find that magma oceans and deep-water cycling can maintain or recover habitable surface conditions on Earth-like planets at the inner edge of the habitable zone around late M-dwarf stars -- these planets would otherwise be desiccated if they form with less than ${\sim}$10 terrestrial oceans of water.

 - **Abstract**
 The ultra-short-period super-Earth 55 Cancri e has a measured radius of 1.8 Earth radii. Previous thermal phase curve observations suggest a strong temperature contrast between the dayside and nightside of around 1000 K with the hottest point shifted $41\pm12$ degrees east from the substellar point, indicating some degree of heat circulation. The dayside (and potentially even the nightside) is hot enough to harbour a magma ocean. We use results from general circulation models (GCMs) of atmospheres to constrain the surface temperature contrasts. There is still a large uncertainty on the vigour and style of mantle convection in super-Earths, especially those that experience stellar irradiation large enough to harbour a magma ocean. In this work, we aim to constrain the mantle dynamics of the tidally locked lava world 55 Cancri e. Using the surface temperature contrasts as boundary condition, we model the mantle flow of 55 Cancri e using 2D mantle convection simulations and investigate how the convection regimes are affected by the different climate models. We find that large super-plumes form on the dayside if that hemisphere is covered by a magma ocean and the nightside remains solid or only partially molten. Cold material descends into the deep interior on the nightside, but no strong downwellings form. In some cases, the super-plume also moves several tens of degrees towards the terminator. A convective regime where the upwelling is preferentially on the dayside might lead to preferential outgassing on that hemisphere which could lead to the build-up of atmospheric species that could be chemically distinct from the nightside.

 - **Abstract**
 Kilonovae are a novel class of astrophysical transients, and the only observationally-confirmed site of rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis (the r-process) in the Universe. To date, only a handful of kilonovae have been detected, with just a single spectroscopically-observed event (AT 2017gfo). Spectra of AT 2017gfo provided evidence for the formation of elements heavier than iron; however, these spectra were collected during the first ~ 10 days, when emission from light r-process elements dominates the observations. Heavier elements, if synthesised, are expected to shape the late-time evolution of the kilonova, beyond the phases for which we have spectral observations. Here we present spectroscopic observations of a rapidly-reddening thermal transient, following the gamma-ray burst, GRB 230307A. Early (2.4 day) optical spectroscopy identifies the presence of a hot (T ~ 6700 K) thermal continuum. By 29 days, this component has expanded and cooled significantly (T ~ 640 K), yet it remains optically thick, indicating the presence of high-opacity ejecta. We show that these properties can only be explained by the merger of compact objects, and further, leads us to infer the production of the heavy lanthanide elements. We identify several spectral features (in both absorption and emission), whose cause can be explained by newly-synthesised heavy elements. This event marks only the second recorded spectroscopic evidence for the synthesis of r-process elements, and the first to be observed at such late times.

 - **Abstract**
 Kilonovae are a rare class of astrophysical transients powered by the radioactive decay of nuclei heavier than iron, synthesized in the merger of two compact objects. Over the first few days, the kilonova evolution is dominated by a large number of radioactive isotopes contributing to the heating rate. On timescales of weeks to months, its behavior is predicted to differ depending on the ejecta composition and merger remnant. However, late-time observations of known kilonovae are either missing or limited. Here we report observations of a luminous red transient with a quasi-thermal spectrum, following an unusual gamma-ray burst of long duration. We classify this thermal emission as a kilonova and track its evolution up to two months after the burst. At these late times, the recession of the photospheric radius and the rapidly-decaying bolometric luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}\propto t^{-2.7\pm 0.4}$) support the recombination of lanthanide-rich ejecta as they cool.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting H2O in exoplanet atmospheres is the first step on the path to determining planet habitability. Coronagraphic design currently limits the observing strategy used to detect H2O, requiring the choice of specific bandpasses to optimize abundance constraints. In order to examing the optimal observing strategy for initial characterization of habitable planets using coronagraph-based direct imaging, we quantify the detectability of H2O as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and molecular abundance across 25 bandpasses in the visible wavelength range (0.5-1 micron). We use a pre-constructed grid consisting of 1.4 million geometric albedo spectra across a range of abundance and pressure, and interpolate the produce forward models for an efficient nested sampling routine, PSGnest. We first test the detectability of H2O in atmospheres that mimix a modern-Earth twin, and then expand to examine a wider range of H2O abundances; for each abundance value, we constrain the optimal 20% bandpasses based on the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data. We present our findings of H2O detectability as functions of SNR, wavelength, and abundance, and discuss how to use these results for optimizing future coronographic instrument design. We find that there are specific points in wavelength where H2o can be detected down to 0.74 micron with moderate-SNR data for abundances at the upper end of Earth's presumed historical values, while at 0.9 micron, detectability is possible with low-SNR data at modern Earth abundances of H2O.

 - **Abstract**
 The chaotic nature of outer space and the limitation of visual displays command for much more than visual display of information and for the integration of other sensorial modalities during data exploration. Haptic real time devices may enrich the detection of astronomical events that otherwise would escape the eyes. Departing from the Harvard Astronomy Lab Orchestar (color Arduino) we present the work in progress of the Proof of Concept (PoC) of a sensitive yet simple device to Bluetooth transfer real time color into haptic motion built by Adafruit components. We assemble 2 Adafruit nRF52840 feather express with the RGB color sensor and haptic driver respectively to trigger vibrations according to the color variation from external light sources. In addition, a transparent hexagon cover will be mounted on the color sensor to maximise absorbed light from the telescope. The device aims to be a translator for people to see hear and feel the hidden information from the original data set. We also present its application in the calculation of complex astrophysics quantities such as the masses of solar coronal mass ejections.
#### The current state of disk wind observations in BHLMXBs through X-ray  absorption lines in the iron band

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of blueshifted absorption lines in the X-ray spectra of Black Hole Low Mass X-ray Binaries is the telltale of massive outflows called winds. These signatures are found almost exclusively in soft states of high-inclined systems, hinting at equatorial ejections originating from the accretion disk and deeply intertwined with the evolution of the outburst patterns displayed by these systems. In the wake of the launch of the new generation of X-ray spectrometers, studies of wind signatures remain mostly restricted to single sources and outbursts, with some of the recent detections departing from the commonly expected behaviors. We thus give an update to the current state of iron band absorption lines detections, through the analysis of all publicly available XMM-$Newton$-PN and $Chandra$-HETG exposures of known Black Hole Low-Mass X-ray Binary candidates. Our results agree with previous studies, with wind detections exclusively found in dipping, high-inclined sources, and almost exclusively in bright ($L_{X}>0.01L_{Edd}$) soft ($HR<0.8$) states, with blueshift values generally restricted to few 100 km s$^{-1}$. The line parameters indicate similar properties between objects and outbursts of single sources, and despite more than 20 years of data, very few sources have the HID sampling necessary to properly study the evolution of the wind during single outbursts. We provide an online tool with details of the wind signatures and outburst evolution data for all sources in the sample.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanets can be detected with various observational techniques. Among them, radial velocity (RV) has the key advantages of revealing the architecture of planetary systems and measuring planetary mass and orbital eccentricities. RV observations are poised to play a key role in the detection and characterization of Earth twins. However, the detection of such small planets is not yet possible due to very complex, temporally correlated instrumental and astrophysical stochastic signals. Furthermore, exploring the large parameter space of RV models exhaustively and efficiently presents difficulties. In this review, we frame RV data analysis as a problem of detection and parameter estimation in unevenly sampled, multivariate time series. The objective of this review is two-fold: to introduce the motivation, methodological challenges, and numerical challenges of RV data analysis to nonspecialists, and to unify the existing advanced approaches in order to identify areas for improvement.
