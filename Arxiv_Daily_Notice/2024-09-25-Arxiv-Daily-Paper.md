          Gaussian Process Models Impact the Inferred Properties of Giant Planets around Active Stars

 - **Abstract**
 The recent development of statistical methods that can distinguish between stellar activity and dynamical signals in radial velocity (RV) observations has facilitated the discovery and characterization of planets orbiting young stars. One such technique, Gaussian process (GP) regression, has been regularly employed to improve the detection of a growing number of planets, but the impact of this model for mitigating stellar activity has not been uniformly analyzed for a large sample with real observations. The goal of this study is to investigate how GPs can affect the inferred parameters of RV-detected planets. We homogeneously analyze how two commonly adopted GP frameworks, a GP trained on RVs alone and a GP pretrained on photometry and then applied to RVs, can influence the inferred physical and orbital parameters compared to a traditional Keplerian orbit fit. Our sample comprises 17 short-period giant planets orbiting stars that exhibit a broad range of activity levels. We find that the decision to adopt GPs, as well as the choice of GP framework, can result in variations of inferred parameters such as minimum planet mass and eccentricity by up to 67% and 95%, respectively. This implies that the method for modeling stellar activity in RVs of young planet-hosting stars can have widespread ramifications on the interpretation of planet properties including their masses, densities, circularization timescales, and tidal quality factors. When mitigating stellar activity with GPs, we recommend carrying out comparative tests between different models to assess the sensitivity of planet physical and orbital parameters to these choices.

          Mind the Gap between A2061 and A2067: Unveiling new diffuse large-scale radio emission

 - **Abstract**
 The clusters Abell 2061 and Abell 2067 in the Corona Borealis supercluster have been studied at different radio frequencies and are both known to host diffuse radio emission. The aim of this work is to investigate the radio emission in between them, suggested by low resolution observations. We analyse deep LOFAR HBA observations at 144 MHz to follow up on the possible intercluster filament suggested by previous 1.4 GHz observations. We investigate the radial profiles and the point-to-point surface brightness correlation of the emission in A2061 with radio and Xray observations, to describe the nature of the diffuse emission. We report the detection of diffuse radio emission on 800 kpc scale, more extended than previously known, reaching beyond the radio halo in A2061 towards A2067 and over the separation outside the two clusters R500 radii. We confirm the presence of a radio halo in A2061, while do not find evidence of diffuse emission in A2067. The surface brightness profile from the centre of A2061 shows an excess of emission with respect to the azimuthally averaged radio halo profile and X-ray background. We explore three different dynamical scenario to explain the nature of the diffuse emission. We analyse a trail of emission of 760 kpc between the radio halo and radio relic in A2061. This pre merger system closely resembles the two other cluster pairs where radio bridges connecting the radio halos on Mpc scales have been detected. The diffuse emission extends beyond each cluster R500 radius but in this unique case, the absence of the radio halo in A2067 is likely the reason for the observed 'gap' between the two systems. However, the point-to-point correlation results are challenging to explain. The classification of the emission remains unclear, and detailed spectral analysis and further Xray observations are required to understand the origin of the diffuse emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Wide, highly eccentric ($e>0.9$) compact binaries can naturally arise as progenitors of gravitational wave (GW) mergers. These systems are expected to have a significant population in the mHz band, with their GW signals characterized by ``repeated bursts" emitted upon each pericenter passage. In this study, we show that the detection of mHz GW signals from highly eccentric stellar mass binaries in the local universe can strongly constrain their orbital parameters. Specifically, it can achieve a relative measurement error of $\sim 10^{-6}$ for orbital frequency and $\sim 1\%$ for eccentricity (as $1-e$) in most of the detectable cases. On the other hand, the binary's mass ratio, distance, and intrinsic orbital inclination may be less precisely determined due to degeneracies in the GW waveform. We also perform mock LISA data analysis to evaluate the realistic detectability of highly eccentric compact binaries. Our results show that highly eccentric systems could be efficiently identified when multiple GW sources and stationary Gaussian instrumental noise are present in the detector output. This work highlights the potential of extracting the signal of ``bursting'' LISA sources to provide valuable insights into their orbital evolution, surrounding environment, and formation channels.

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disks exhibit a rich variety of substructure in millimeter continuum emission, often attributed to unseen planets. As these planets carve gaps in the gas, dust particles can accumulate in the resulting pressure bumps, forming bright features in the dust continuum. We investigate the role of dust dynamics in the gap-opening process with 2D radiation hydrodynamics simulations of planet--disk interaction and a two-population dust component modeled as a pressureless fluid. We consider the opacity feedback and backreaction due to drag forces as mm grains accumulate in pressure bumps at different stages of dust growth. We find that dust dynamics can significantly affect the resulting substructure driven by the quasi-thermal-mass planet with $M_p/M_\star=10^{-4}$. Opacity feedback causes nonaxisymmetric features to become more compact in azimuth, whereas the drag-induced backreaction tends to dissolve nonaxisymmetries. For our fiducial model, this results in multiple concentric rings of dust rather than the expected vortices and corotating dust clumps found in models without dust feedback. A higher coagulation fraction disproportionately enhances the effect of dust opacity feedback, favoring the formation of crescents rather than rings. Our results suggest that turbulent diffusion is not always necessary to explain the rarity of observed nonaxisymmetric features, and that incorporating dust dynamics is vital for interpreting the observed substructure in protoplanetary disks. We also describe and test the implementation of the publicly-available dust fluid module in the PLUTO code.

          Signatures of anti-social mass-loss in the ordinary Type II SN 2024bch - A non-interacting supernova with early high-ionisation features

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we analyse the spectro-photometric properties of the Type II supernova \sn, exploded at a distance of $19.9\,\rm{Mpc}$, in NGC~3206. Its early spectra are characterised by narrow high-ionisation emission lines, often interpreted as signatures of ongoing interaction between rapidly expanding ejecta and a confined dense circumstellar medium. However, we provide a model of the bolometric light curve of the transient that does not require sources of energy different than the H recombination and radioactive decays. Our model can reproduce the bolometric light curve of SN~2024bch adopting an ejected mass of $M_{bulk}\simeq5$\msun~surrounded by an extended envelope of only 0.2\msun~with an outer radius $R_{env}=7.0\times10^{13}\,\rm{cm}$. An accurate modelling focused on the radioactive part of the light curve, which accounts for incomplete $\gamma-$ray trapping, gives a $^{56}\rm{Ni}$ mass of 0.048\msun. We propose narrow lines to be powered by Bowen fluorescence induced by scattering of \ion{He}{II} Ly$\alpha$ photons, resulting in the emission of high-ionisation resonance lines. Simple light travel time calculations based on the maximum phase of the narrow emission lines place the inner radius of the H-rich, un-shocked shell at a radius $\simeq4.4\times10^{15}\,\rm{cm}$, compatible with an absence of ejecta-CSM interaction during the first weeks of evolution. Possible signatures of interaction appear only $\sim69\,\rm{days}$ after explosion, although the resulting conversion of kinetic energy into radiation does not seem to contribute significantly to the total luminosity of the transient.

          The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration. III. Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution IFU Spectrometer

 - **Abstract**
 We describe the spectrophotometric calibration of the Mid-Infrared Instrument's (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This calibration is complicated by a time-dependent evolution in the effective throughput of the MRS; this evolution is strongest at long wavelengths, approximately a factor of 2 at 25um over the first two years of the mission. We model and correct for this evolution through regular observations of internal calibration lamps. Pixel flatfields are constructed from observations of the infrared-bright planetary nebula NGC 7027, and photometric aperture corrections from a combination of theoretical models and observations of bright standard stars. We tie the 5--18um flux calibration to high signal/noise (S/N; ~ 600-1000) observations of the O9 V star 10 Lacertae, scaled to the average calibration factor of nine other spectrophotometric standards. We calibrate the 18--28um spectral range using a combination of observations of main belt asteroid 515 Athalia and the circumstellar disk around young stellar object SAO 206462. The photometric repeatability is stable to better than 1% in the wavelength range 5--18um, and the S/N ratio of the delivered spectra is consistent between bootstrapped measurements, pipeline estimates, and theoretical predictions. The MRS point-source calibration agrees with that of the MIRI imager to within 1% from 7 to 21um and is approximately 1% fainter than prior Spitzer observations, while the extended source calibration agrees well with prior Cassini/CIRS and Voyager/IRIS observations.

          Minimum gas mass accreted by spinning intermediate-mass black holes in stellar clusters

 - **Abstract**
 The spin of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) growing through repeated black hole mergers in stellar clusters statistically asymptotes to zero. Putative observations of IMBHs with dimensionless spin parameter $\chi\gtrsim 0.6$ would require a phase of coherent gas accretion to spin up the black hole. We estimate the amount of gas necessary to produce a given IMBH spin. If the observed IMBH mass and spin are $M\gtrsim 1000~M_\odot$ and $\chi\gtrsim 0.6$, respectively, the IMBH must have coherently accreted at least $\sim 100~M_\odot$ of gas. In this scenario, as long as the spin is not maximal, the IMBH can only accrete at most half of its mass. Our estimates can constrain the relative contribution of accretion and mergers to the growth of IMBHs in dense stellar environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The correction map method means extended phase-space algorithm with correction map. In our research, we have developed a correction map method, specifically the dissipated correction map method with trapezoidal rule, for numerical simulations of gravitational waves from spinning compact binary systems. This new correction map method, denoted as $CM3$, has shown remarkable performance in various simulation results, such as phase space distance, dissipated energy error, and gravitational waveform, closely resembling the high-order precision implicit Gaussian algorithm. When compared to the previously used midpoint map which denoted as $C_2$, the $CM3$ consistently exhibits a closer alignment with the highly accurate Gaussian algorithm in waveform evolution and orbital trajectory analysis. Through detailed comparisons and analyses, it is evident that $CM3$ outperforms other algorithms, including $CM2$ and $C_2$ mentioned in this paper, in terms of accuracy and precision in simulating spinning compact binary systems. The incorporation of the trapezoidal rule and the optimization with a scale factor $\gamma$ have significantly enhanced the performance of $CM3$, making it a promising method for future numerical simulations in astrophysics. With the groundbreaking detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO/VIRGO collaboration, interest in this research domain has soared. Our work contributes valuable insights for the application of matched filtering techniques in the analysis of gravitational wave signals, enhancing the precision and reliability of these detection.

 - **Abstract**
 We scrutinize the reported lensing anomaly of the CMB by considering several phenomenological modifications of the lensing consistency parameter, $A_{\rm L}$. Considering Planck spectra alone, we find statisically significant evidence for scale dependence (`running') of $A_{\rm L}$. We then demonstrate that the anomaly is entirely driven by Planck's low multipoles, $\ell \leq 30$. When these data points are excluded a joint analysis with several other datasets clearly favors $\Lambda$CDM over the extended $\Lambda \rm CDM+A_L$ model. Not only that the lensing anomaly and low $\ell$ anomaly of the CMB go away in this case, but also the $S_8$ tension is ameliorated, and only the Hubble tension persists.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents VARnet, a capable signal processing model for rapid astronomical timeseries analysis. VARnet leverages wavelet decomposition, a novel method of Fourier feature extraction via the Finite-Embedding Fourier Transform (FEFT), and deep learning to detect faint signals in light curves, utilizing the strengths of modern GPUs to achieve sub-millisecond single-source runtime. We apply VARnet to the NEOWISE Single-Exposure Database, which holds nearly 200 billion apparitions over 10.5 years of infrared sources on the entire sky. This paper devises a pipeline in order to extract variable candidates from the NEOWISE data, serving as a proof of concept for both the efficacy of VARnet and methods for an upcoming variability survey over the entirety of the NEOWISE dataset. We implement models and simulations to synthesize unique light curves to train VARnet. In this case, the model achieves an F1 score of $0.91$ over a 4-class classification scheme on a validation set of real variable sources present in the infrared. With $\sim2000$ points per light curve on a GPU with 22GB of VRAM, VARnet produces a per-source processing time of $<53\mu s$. We confirm that our VARnet is sensitive and precise to both known and previously undiscovered variable sources. These methods prove promising for a complete future survey of variability with WISE, and effectively showcase the power of the VARnet model architecture.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) offer unique probes of diverse cosmological phenomena due to their characteristic properties, including short duration timescale and high dispersion measure. This study investigates two distinct theoretical frameworks: the Gertsenshtein-Zel'dovich (GZ) mechanism for ultra-high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) and fraction of dark matter in primordial mass black holes. We explore the hypothesis that ultra-high-frequency GWs could be responsible for FRB generation. Consequently, the detection of continuous GWs signal from the vicinity of an FRB by current or future detectors would disfavour merger-based FRB formation models and lend significant credence to the GZ theory, which postulates the existence of high-frequency GWs. Moreover, we examine the effects of modified gravity on the gravitational lensing of FRBs and thereby put constraints on the fraction of primordial mass black holes made up of dark matter. Our analysis suggests that modified gravity introduces a screening effect on lensing, analogous to the scattering effect by plasma on light rays. We further discuss the expected detection rates of FRBs as well as lensed FRBs with upcoming radio telescopes, primarily HIRAX.

          False Alarm Rate based Statistical Detection Limit for Astronomical Photon Detectors

 - **Abstract**
 In ultra-fast astronomical observations featuring fast transients on sub-$\mu$s time scales, the conventional Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) threshold, often fixed at $5\sigma$, becomes inadequate as observational window timescales shorten, leading to unsustainably high False Alarm Rates (FAR). We provide a basic statistical framework that captures the essential noise generation processes relevant to the analysis of time series data from photon-counting detectors. In particular, we establish a protocol of defining detection limits in astronomical photon-counting experiments, such that a FAR-based criterion is preferred over the traditional SNR-based threshold scheme. We develop statistical models that account for noise sources such as dark counts, sky background, and crosstalk, and establish a probabilistic detection criterion applicable to high-speed detectors. We compare the performance of several detector technologies, including photon-counting CMOS/CCDs, SPADs, SiPMs, and PMTs, in detecting faint astronomical signals. These findings offer insights into optimizing detector choice for future ultra-fast astronomical instruments and suggest pathways for improving detection fidelity under rapid observational conditions.

          Constraints on anisotropic properties of the universe in $f(Q, T)$ gravity theory

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by anomalies in cosmic microwave background observations, we investigate the implications of $f(Q, T)$ gravity in Bianchi type-I spacetime, aiming to characterize the universe's spatially homogeneous and anisotropic properties. By using a linear combination of non-metricity $Q$ and the energy-momentum tensor trace $T$, we parametrize the deceleration parameter and derive the Hubble solution, which we then impose in the Friedmann equations of $f(Q, T)$ gravity. Bayesian analysis is employed to find the best-fit values of model parameters, with $1-\sigma$ and $2-\sigma$ contour plots illustrating the constraints from observational data, including $H(z)$ data and the Pantheon+ sample. Our analysis reveals a transition from a decelerated to an accelerated expansion phase, with the present deceleration parameter indicating an accelerating universe. The energy density gradually decreases over time, approaching zero for the present and future, indicating continuous expansion. The anisotropic pressure, initially notably negative, transitions to slightly negative values, suggesting the presence of dark energy. The evolving equation of state parameter $\omega$ exhibits behavior akin to phantom energy, influenced by spacetime anisotropy. Violations of the null energy condition and the strong energy condition imply phantom-like behavior and accelerated expansion.

 - **Abstract**
 In spite of the importance of studying the cosmic generation of heavy elements through the r-process, the detection of kilonova resulted from a merger of neutron star binaries is still a challenge task. In this paper, we show that the Visible Telescope (VT) onboard the on-going SVOM space mission is powerful for identifying kilonova candidates associated with short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) up to a distance of 600Mpc. A significant color variation, turn blue and then turn red, is revealed by calculating the light curves in both red and blue channels of VT by a linear combination of an afterglow and an associated kilonova. The maximum color variation is as high as $\sim0.5-1$ mag, which is far larger than the small photometry error of $\sim0.2$ mag of VT for a point source with a brightness of 23 mag. Up to a distance of 600Mpc, $\sim1-2$ kilonova candidates per year are predicted to be identified by VT.

          Revisiting the Local Interstellar Radiation Field using Gaia DR3

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Dust grains in the interstellar medium are heated by the integrated radiation from stars in the Milky Way. A knowledge of the Local Interstellar Radiation Field (LISRF) is thus necessary to interpret observations of dust emission in the infrared and constrain (some of) the properties of interstellar grains. The LISRF representation most widely used in dust modelling still dates back to the seminal works of Mezger et al. (1982) and Mathis et al. (1983). Aims: A new version of the LISRF is presented, starting from the photometry of the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) and revisiting available data, among which observations from the Pioneer 10 and 11 probes. Methods: The LISRF contribution by direct starlight is estimated in the Gaia bands by summing fluxes of all stars in DR3; the LISRF is extrapolated from the optical to the ultraviolet and near-infrared, using the astrophysical parameters provided by DR3 for a subsample of Gaia stars; the correlation between dust emission at 100 um and residual diffuse emission in the Pioneer and other available maps is exploited to derive the contribution of dust-scattered starlight to the LISRF. Results: The new LISRF is significantly redder and emits ~30% more energy than the old model. The old LISRF is almost a factor two lower in the near-infrared, while in the optical it accounts only for direct starlight. For |b|<50 degree, diffuse starlight contributes on average to ~25% of the total radiation, 3x more than what predicted by literature estimates at high Galactic latitude. Conclusions: The new LISRF can modify the predicted mid-infrared dust emission beyond the uncertainties normally assumed between dust models and observational constraints; these differences should be taken into account to redefine the properties of small grains and of the carriers of the mid-infrared emission bands.

          Gaia BH1 and BH2 - Evolutionary Models with Overshooting of the Black Hole Progenitors within the Present-Day Binary Separation

 - **Abstract**
 Three black holes (BHs) in wide binaries - Gaia BH1, BH2 and BH3 - were recently discovered. The likely progenitors of the BHs were massive stars that experienced a supergiant phase, reaching radii of ~1000 Rsun, before collapsing to form the BH. Such radii are difficult to accommodate with the present-day orbits of BH1 and BH2 - with semi-major axes of 1.4 and 3.7 au, respectively. In this letter, we show that the maximal radii of the supergiants are not necessarily so large, and realistic stellar evolution models, with some assumed overshooting above the convective core into the radiative stellar envelope, produce substantially smaller maximal radii. The limited expansion of supergiants is consistent with the empirical Humphreys-Davidson limit - the absence of red supergiants above an upper luminosity limit, notably lower than the highest luminosity of main-sequence stars. We propose that the evolution that led to the formation of Gaia BH1 and BH2 simply did not involve an expansion to the cool supergiant phase.

          Secrets in the shadow: High precision stellar abundances of fast-rotating A-type exoplanet host stars through transit spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The spectra of fast-rotating A-type stars have strongly broadened absorption lines. This effect causes blending of the absorption lines, hindering the measurement of the abundances of the elements that are in the stellar photosphere. Aims. As the exoplanet transits across its host star, it obscures the stellar spectrum that is emitted from directly behind the planet. We aim to extract this obscured spectrum because it is less affected by rotational broadening, resolving the blending of weak lines of elements that would otherwise remain inaccessible. This allows us to more precisely measure the metal abundances in ultra-hot Jupiter systems, many of which have fast rotating host stars. Methods. We develop a novel method that isolates the stellar spectra behind the planet during a spectral time-series, and reconstructs the disc-integrated non-broadened spectrum of the host star. We have systematically tested this method with model-generated spectra of the transit of WASP-189 b across its fast-rotating A-type host star, assessing the effects of limb darkening, choice of absorption lines, signal to noise regime; and demonstrating the sensitivity to photospheric parameters ($T_{\text{eff}}$, $\log g$) and elemental abundances. We apply the method to observations by the HARPS high-resolution spectrograph. Results. For WASP-189, we obtain the metallicity and photospheric abundances for several species previously not reported in literature, Mg, Ca and Ti, with significantly improved accuracy compared to the ordinary broadened stellar spectrum. This method can be generally applied to other transiting systems in which abundance determinations via spectral synthesis are imprecise due to severe line blending. It is important to accurately determine the photospheric properties of exoplanet host stars, as it can provide further insight into the formation and evolution of the planets.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we explore a novel framework for explaining the mass and radius relationships of observed neutron stars by considering strange stars (SSs) admixed with mirror dark matter (MDM). We develop a theoretical model that incorporates non-commutative algebra to describe the interactions between ordinary strange quark matter (SQM) and MDM, which are predicted to form compact objects that could explain recent astrophysical data, including observations of PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0437-4715, and the central compact object in HESS J1731-347. Notably, we demonstrate that the exotic mass-radius measurement of XTE J1814-338 can be explained by the presence of a mirror SS with an ordinary SQM core. In contrast to other explanations based on boson stars, our SS+MDM model offers a natural explanation for this system. We provide detailed mass-radius comparisons with observational data and discuss future observations that could test the predictions of our model, offering new insights into neutron star structure and the role of dark matter in compact objects.

 CORSIKA 8 is a new framework for simulations of particle cascades in air and dense media implemented in modern C++17, based on past experience with existing codes, in particular CORSIKA 7. The flexible and modular structure of the project allows the development of independent modules that can produce a fully customizable particle shower simulation. The radio module in particular is designed to treat the electric field calculation and its propagation through complex media to each observer location in an autonomous and flexible way. It already allows for the simultaneous simulation of the radio emission calculated with two independent time-domain formalisms, the "Endpoint formalism" as previously implemented in CoREAS and the "ZHS" algorithm as ported from ZHAireS. The design acts as the baseline interface for current and future development for the simulation of radio emission from particle showers in standard and complex scenarios, such as cross-media showers penetrating from air into ice. In this work, we present the design and implementation of the radio module in CORSIKA 8, along with validation studies and a direct comparison of the radio emission from air showers simulated with CORSIKA 8, CORSIKA 7 and ZHAireS. We also present the impact of simulation details such as the step size of simulated particle tracks on radio-emission simulations and perform a direct comparison of the "Endpoints" and "ZHS" formalisms for the same underlying air showers. Finally, we present an in-depth comparison of CORSIKA 8 and CORSIKA 7 for optimum simulation settings and discuss the relevance of observed differences in light of reconstruction efforts for the energy and mass of cosmic rays.

 - **Abstract**
 This study aims to identify potential exoplanet signals from nearby stars with resolved debris discs. However, the high activity of many stars with debris discs limits the detection of periodic signals. Our study is constrained to a sample of 29 stars that have appropriate radial velocity data and debris disc measurements sufficient to resolve their inclination. Our results confirm and update previous findings for exoplanets around HD 10647, HD 115617, HD 69830, GJ 581, HD 22049, and HD 142091, and we identify long-term activity signals around HD 207129 and HD 202628. We utilize the inclination angles of the debris discs, assuming co-planarity between debris disc and exoplanet orbit, to determine the "disc-aligned" masses of radial velocity exoplanets in this study. The "disc-aligned" masses of HD 69830 b, HD 69830 c, and 61 Vir b suggest that they may be classified as 'hot' or 'warm' Jupiters and so might be nearby examples of planets that have undergone recent type-II disc migration.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the active regions of the M3.0V star G 80-21 using the observed data from the CARMENES project with synthetic spectra generated by the RH1.5D radiative transfer code. The CARMENES project aims to search for exoplanets around M dwarfs using high-resolution near-infrared and optical echelle spectrographs. By comparing the observed data and models for the chromospheric lines of H$_\alpha$ and the bluest Ca II infrared triplet line, we obtain the best-fit models for this star. The optimal fitting for the observed spectrum of G 80-21 is achieved by employing two active areas in conjunction with an inactive regions, with a calcium abundance of [Ca/H] = $-$0.4. This combination successfully fits all the observed data across varying ratios. The minor active component consistently comprises approximately 18\% of the total (ranging from 14\% to 20\%), which suggests that the minor active component is likely located in the polar regions. Meanwhile, the major active component occupies a variable proportion, ranging from 51\% to 82\%. Our method allows for the determination of the structure and size of stellar chromospheric active regions by analyzing high-resolution observed spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Planetary Enriched White Dwarf Database (PEWDD), a collection of published photospheric abundances of white dwarfs accreting planetary debris alongside additional information relevant to metal-enrichment and the presence of infrared excesses, emission lines, and binary companions. PEWDD contains at the time of publishing information on 1739 white dwarfs and will be kept up-to-date with information from new publications. A total of 24 photospheric metals are recorded and are linked to accretion of exo-planetary material. The overall properties of metal-enriched white dwarfs are severely affected by observational selection effects; in particular we find that what metals are detectable strongly correlates with the effective temperature. By considering metal-enriched white dwarfs which have abundances measured by different methods, we find a spread that is comparable with the often quoted ad-hoc estimated abundance uncertainties, i.e. ~0.1-0.2dex. We draw attention to a dichotomy in the median accretion rates for metal-enriched H- and He-dominated white dwarfs, with M_{acc, H} = 7.7e7g/s and M_{acc, He} = 8.7e8g/s when extrapolating bulk compositions from bulk Earth Ca abundance. We identify 40 metal-enriched white dwarfs in binary systems and find evidence that enrichment is suppressed by binary companions within 200au.

 - **Abstract**
 The importance of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) for pulsar research is becoming increasingly prominent and receiving more and more attention. In this paper, we present pathfinding pulsar observation results with the Chinese VLBI Network (CVN) incorporating the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). On MJD 60045 (April 11th, 2023), PSRs B0919+06 and B1133+16 were observed with the phase-referencing mode in the L-band using four radio telescopes (FAST, TianMa, Haoping and Nanshan) and correlated with the pulsar binning mode of the distributed FX-style software correlator in Shanghai. After further data processing with the NRAO Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS), we detected these two pulsars and fitted their current positions with accuracy at the milliarcsecond level. By comparison, our results show significantly better agreement with predicted values based on historical VLBI observations than that with previous timing observations, as pulsar astrometry with the VLBI provides a more direct and model-independent method for accurately obtaining related parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron star (NS) mergers are known to produce heavy elements through rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis. Actinides are expected to be created solely by the r-process in the most neutron rich environments. Confirming if NS mergers provide the requisite conditions for actinide creation is therefore central to determining their origin in the Universe. Actinide signatures in kilonova (KN) spectra may yield an answer, provided adequate models are available in order to interpret observational data. In this study, we investigate actinide signatures in neutron rich merger ejecta. We use three ejecta models with different compositions and radioactive power, generated by nucleosynthesis calculations using the same initial electron fraction ($Y_e = 0.15$) but with different nuclear physics inputs and thermodynamic expansion history. These are evolved from 10 - 100 days after merger using the SUMO non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) radiative transfer code. We highlight how uncertainties in nuclear properties, as well as choices in thermodynamic trajectory, may yield entirely different outputs for equal values of $Y_e$. We consider an actinide-free model and two actinide-rich models, and find that the emergent spectra and lightcurve evolution are significantly different depending on the amount of actinides present, and the overall decay properties of the models. We also present potential key actinide spectral signatures, of which doubly ionized $_{89}Ac$ and $_{90}Th$ may be particularly interesting as potential spectral indicators of actinide presence in KN ejecta.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars are recognized for their high degree of multiplicity, yet the mass ratio regime below 0.1 remains insufficiently explored. It is therefore unknown whether extremely low-mass (possibly substellar) companions can form and survive in the direct UV-irradiated environment of massive stars. In this paper, we discuss VLT/SPHERE IFS (0".15 - 0".85) observations of six massive O- and early B-type stars in Sco OB1 and M17 that each have a low-mass candidate companion. Two targets have companions that are brown dwarf candidates. The other four have candidate companions in the low end of the stellar mass regime ($\leq$ 0.30 M$_\odot$). For three of these, we have obtained a second epoch observation. At least two sources exhibit similar proper motion to that of their central star. However, given the expected proper motion of background objects, this does not imply certain companionship. We show how future follow-up observations of the brown dwarf candidate companions in $J$, $H$ and $L$ bands should allow for an unambiguous confirmation of their nature.

          JWST Resolves CIA Features in White Dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared-faint white dwarfs are cool white dwarfs exhibiting significant infrared flux deficits, most often attributed to collision-induced absorption (CIA) from H$_2$-He in mixed hydrogen-helium atmospheres. We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) near- and mid-infrared spectra of three such objects using NIRSpec (0.6-5.3 $\mu$m) and MIRI (5-14 $\mu$m): LHS 3250, WD J1922+0233, and LHS 1126. Surprisingly, for LHS 3250, we detect no H$_2$-He CIA absorption at 2.4 $\mu$m, instead observing an unexpected small flux bump at this wavelength. WD J1922+0233 exhibits the anticipated strong absorption feature centered at 2.4 $\mu$m, but with an unexpected narrow emission-like feature inside this absorption band. LHS 1126 shows no CIA features and follows a $\lambda^{-2}$ power law in the mid-infrared. LHS 1126's lack of CIA features suggests a very low hydrogen abundance, with its infrared flux depletion likely caused by He-He-He CIA. For LHS 3250 and WD J1922+0233, the absence of a 1.2 $\mu$m CIA feature in both stars argues against ultracool temperatures, supporting recent suggestions that infrared-faint white dwarfs are warmer and more massive than previously thought. This conclusion is further solidified by Keck near-infrared spectroscopy of seven additional objects. We explore possible explanations for the unexpected emission-like features in both stars, and temperature inversions above the photosphere emerge as a promising hypothesis. Such inversions may be common among the infrared-faint population, and since they significantly affect the infrared spectral energy distribution, this would impact their photometric fits. Further JWST observations are needed to confirm the prevalence of this phenomenon and guide the development of improved atmospheric models.

 - **Abstract**
 The spectroscopic redshift measurement of BL Lac, a class of blazar, is challenging because its spectrum has no or weak emission lines ($\leqslant5Å$). We estimate the redshift by the photometric dropout technique for a sample of 64 blazars (59 BL Lacs and five blazar candidates of uncertainty type). Two telescopes are utilized to observe the sample: the {\it Swift} space telescope observes sources in $uvw2,\ uvm2,\ uvw1,\ u,\ b,\ v$ filters, while the ground-based telescopes SARA-CT/RM observed sources in $g',\ r,' \ i',\ z'$ filters. The photometric data are obtained using the {\it photozpy} package. We fit the photometric data by the LePhare package and report four new high-$z$ ($z>1.3$) BL Lacs at $2.03^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$, $1.84^{+0.10}_{-0.03}$, $2.04^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$, $2.93^{+0.01}_{-0.04}$ as well as upper limits for 50 sources. The work increased the number of high-$z$ BL Lacs found by this method up to 23. The high-$z$ sources are discussed in the context of the cosmic gamma-ray horizon, blazar sequence, Fermi blazar divide, and masquerading BL Lacs.

 - **Abstract**
 Vertical gas and dust flows in protoplanetary discs waft material above the midplane region in the presence of a protoplanet. This motion may alter the delivery of dust to the planet and its circumplanetary disc, as well as through a planetary-induced gap region and hence the inner disc chemistry. Here, we investigate the impact of a massive embedded planet on this material transport through the gap region. We use 3D global hydrodynamic simulations run using FARGO3D with gas and dust species to investigate the dust filtration and the origin of material that can make it through the gap. We find small dust particles can pass through the gap as expected from results in 2D, and that this can be considered in two parts - filtering due to the planetary-induced pressure maximum, and filtering due to accretion onto the planet. When gas accretion onto the planet is included, we find that the larger dust grains that cross the gap (i.e. those with $\mathrm{St} \sim 10^{-4}$) originate from regions near the mid-plane. We also find that dust and gas that enter the planet-carved gap region pass through the Hill sphere of the planet, where the temperature is likely to be strongly enhanced compared with the mid-plane regions from which this material originated. Considering the application of our simulations to a Jupiter-mass planet at $\sim 100\ \mathrm{AU}$, this suggests that CO ice is very likely to desorb from grains in the close proximity of the planet, without requiring any fine-tuning of the planet's location with respect to the CO snowline.

 - **Abstract**
 Liger is an adaptive optics (AO) fed imager and integral field spectrograph (IFS) designed to take advantage of the Keck All-sky Precision Adaptive-optics (KAPA) upgrade to the Keck I telescope. Liger adapts the design of the InfraRed Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) for the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) to Keck by implementing a new imager and re-imaging optics. The performance of the imager is critical as it sequentially feeds the spectrograph and contains essential components such as the pupil wheel, filter wheel, and pupil viewing camera. We present the design and structural analysis of the Liger imager optical assembly including static, modal, and thermal simulations. We present the fabrication as well as the full assembly and characterization plan. The imager will be assembled bench-top in a clean room utilizing a coordinate-measuring machine (CMM) for warm alignment. To ensure optimal performance, the imager will be characterized in a test cryostat before integration with the full Liger instrument. This comprehensive approach to characterization ensures the precision and reliability of the imager, enhancing the observational capabilities of Liger and W.M. Keck Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot Jupiters are giant planets subject to intense stellar radiation. The physical and chemical properties of their atmosphere makes them the most amenable targets for the atmospheric characterization. In this paper we analyze the photometry collected during the secondary eclipses of the hot Jupiter WASP-3 b by CHEOPS, TESS and Spitzer. Our aim is to characterize the atmosphere of the planet by measuring the secondary eclipse depth in several passbands and constrain the planetary dayside spectrum. Our update of the stellar and planetary properties is consistent with previous works. The analysis of the occultations returns an eclipse depth of 92+-21 ppm in the CHEOPS passband, 83+-27 ppm for TESS and >2000 ppm in the IRAC 1-2-4 Spitzer passbands. Using the eclipse depths in the Spitzer bands we propose a set of likely emission spectra which constrain the emission contribution in the \cheops and TESS passbands to approximately a few dozens of parts per million. This allowed us to measure a geometric albedo of 0.21+-0.07 in the CHEOPS passband, while the TESS data lead to a 95\% upper limit of $\sim$0.2. WASP-3 b belongs to the group of ultra-hot Jupiters which are characterized by low Bond albedo (<0.3+-0.1), as predicted by different atmospheric models. On the other hand, it unexpectedly seems to efficiently recirculate the absorbed stellar energy, unlike similar highly irradiated planets. To explain this inconsistency, we propose that other energy recirculation mechanisms may be at play other than advection (for example, dissociation and recombination of H_2). Another possibility is that the observations in different bandpasses probe different atmospheric layers, making the atmospheric analysis difficult without an appropriate modeling of the thermal emission spectrum of WASP-3 b, which is not feasible with the limited spectroscopic data available to date.

          Extreme Weather Variability on Hot Rocky Exoplanet 55 Cancri e Explained by Magma Temperature-Cloud Feedback

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of the ultra-short period rocky exoplanet 55 Cancri e (55 Cnc e) indicate that the planet's dayside infrared radiation fluctuates by a factor of at least six on sub-weekly timescales, for unknown reasons. We propose a feedback mechanism where increased reflective clouds cool surface magma, subsequently reducing cloud formation, which may offer a potential explanation for these phenomena. In this mechanism, under less cloudy conditions, stellar radiation heats the surface magma, causing it to release more silicate vapor, which then condenses to form reflective clouds. Once formed, these clouds reduce stellar insolation at the surface, leading to surface cooling, which in turn reduces vapor supply, decreasing cloudiness. A time lag between the temperature increase of surface magma and the subsequent increase in cloudiness (likely due to lagged atmospheric transport of cloud-forming vapor) enables self-sustained oscillations in surface temperature and cloud reflectivity. These oscillations manifest as variations in both the emitted thermal radiation and the reflected stellar radiation, causing variability in secondary eclipse depths across different wavelengths without significantly affecting the transit depth. Using a simple model, we find that diverse planetary parameters can reproduce the observations. Additionally, we demonstrate that secondary eclipse depths at different wavelengths can oscillate out of phase, consistent with recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope. Finally, we discuss observational strategies to test this proposed mechanism on 55 Cancri e. If confirmed, observable ocean-atmosphere dynamics on exoplanets would open a new window into the composition, evolution, and fate of rocky planet volatiles.
