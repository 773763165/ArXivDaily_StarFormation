 - **Abstract**
 V1741 Sgr (= SPICY 71482/Gaia22dtk) is a Classical T Tauri star on the outskirts of the Lagoon Nebula. After at least a decade of stability, in mid-2022, the optical source brightened by ~3 mag over two months, remained bright until early 2023, then dimmed erratically over the next four months. This event was monitored with optical and infrared spectroscopy and photometry. Spectra from the peak (October 2022) indicate an EX Lup-type (EXor) accretion outburst, with strong emission from H I, He I, and Ca II lines and CO bands. At this stage, spectroscopic absorption features indicated a temperature of T ~ 4750 K with low-gravity lines (e.g., Ba II and Sr II). By April 2023, with the outburst beginning to dim, strong TiO absorption appeared, indicating a cooler T ~ 3600 K temperature. However, once the source had returned to its pre-outburst flux in August 2023, the TiO absorption and the CO emission disappeared. When the star went into outburst, the source's spectral energy distribution became flatter, leading to bluer colours at wavelengths shorter than ~1.6 microns and redder colours at longer wavelengths. The brightening requires a continuum emitting area larger than the stellar surface, likely from optically thick circumstellar gas with cooler surface layers producing the absorption features. Additional contributions to the outburst spectrum may include blue excess from hotspots on the stellar surface, emission lines from diffuse gas, and reprocessed emission from the dust disc. Cooling of the circumstellar gas would explain the appearance of TiO, which subsequently disappeared once this gas had faded and the stellar spectrum reemerged.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent works have uncovered an excess signal in the parity-odd four-point correlation function measured from the BOSS spectroscopic galaxy survey. If physical in origin, this could indicate evidence for new parity-breaking processes in the scalar sector, most likely from inflation. At heart, these studies compare the observed four-point correlator to the distribution obtained from parity-conserving mock galaxy surveys; if the simulations underestimate the covariance of the data, noise fluctuations may be misinterpreted as a signal. To test this, we reanalyse the BOSS CMASS + LOWZ parity-odd dataset with the noise distribution modeled using the newly developed GLAM-Uchuu suite of mocks. These comprise full N-body simulations that follow the evolution of $2000^3$ dark matter particles in a $\Lambda$CDM universe, and represent a significant upgrade compared to the formerly MultiDark-Patchy mocks, which were based on an alternative (non N-body) gravity solver. We find no significant evidence for parity-violation in the BOSS dataset (with a baseline detection significance of $1.4\sigma$), suggesting that the former signal ($>3.5\sigma$ with our data cuts) could be caused by an underestimation of the covariance in MultiDark-Patchy. The significant differences between results obtained with the two sets of BOSS-calibrated galaxy catalogs showcases the heightened sensitivity of beyond-two-point analyses to the treatment of non-linear effects and indicates that previous constraints may suffer from large systematic uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent Gaia Focused Product Release contains radial velocity time-series for more than 9,000 Gaia long-period photometric variables. Here we search for binary systems with large radial velocity amplitudes to identify candidates with massive, unseen companions. Eight targets have binary mass function $f(M)>1\ M_\odot$, three of which are eclipsing binaries. The remaining five show evidence of ellipsoidal modulations. We fit spectroscopic orbit models to the Gaia radial velocities, and fit the spectral energy distributions of three targets. For the two systems most likely to host dark companions, J0946 and J1640, we use PHOEBE to fit the ASAS-SN light curves and Gaia radial velocities. The derived companion masses are $>3 M_\odot$, but the high Galactic dust extinctions towards these objects limit our ability to rule out main sequence companions or subgiants hotter than the photometric primaries. These systems are similar to other stellar-mass black hole impostors, notably the Unicorn (V723 Mon) and the Giraffe (2M04123153$+$6738486). While it is possible that J1640 and J0946 are similar examples of stripped giant star binaries, high-resolution spectra can be used to determine the nature of their companions.
#### Mass Ejection Driven by Sudden Energy Deposition in Stellar Envelopes

 - **Abstract**
 A number of stellar astrophysical phenomena, such as tidal novae and planetary engulfment, involve sudden injection of sub-binding energy in a thin layer within the star, leading to mass ejection of the stellar envelope. We use a 1D hydrodynamical model to survey the stellar response and mass loss for various amounts ($E_{\mathrm{dep}}$) and locations of the energy deposition. We find that the total mass ejection has a nontrivial dependence on $E_{\mathrm{dep}}$ due to the varying strengths of mass ejection events, which are associated with density/pressure waves breaking out from the stellar surface. The rapid occurrence of multiple breakouts may present a unique observational signature for sudden envelope heating events in stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic X-ray sources are diverse, ranging from active M dwarfs to compact object binaries, and everything in between. The X-ray landscape of today is rich, with point source catalogs such as those from XMM-Newton, Chandra, and Swift, each with $\gtrsim10^5$ sources and growing. Furthermore, X-ray astronomy is on the verge of being transformed through data releases from the all-sky SRG/eROSITA survey. Many X-ray sources can be associated with an optical counterpart, which in the era of Gaia, can be determined to be Galactic or extragalactic through parallax and proper motion information. Here, I present a simple diagram -- the ``X-ray Main Sequence", which distinguishes between compact objects and active stars based on their optical color and X-ray-to-optical flux ratio ($F_X/F_\textrm{opt}$). As a proof of concept, I present optical spectroscopy of six exotic accreting WDs discovered using the X-ray Main Sequence as applied to the XMM-Newton catalog. Looking ahead to surveys of the near future, I additionally present SDSS-V optical spectroscopy of new systems discovered using the X-ray Main Sequence as applied to the SRG/eROSITA eFEDS catalog.

 - **Abstract**
 Accreting main-sequence stars expand significantly when the mass accretion timescale is much shorter than their thermal timescales. This occurs during mass transfer from an evolved giant star onto a main-sequence companion in a binary system, and is an important phase in the formation of compact binaries including X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables, and gravitational-wave sources. In this study, we compute 1D stellar models of main-sequence accretors with different initial masses and accretion rates. The calculations are used to derive semi-analytical approximations to the maximum expansion radius. We assume that mass transfer remains fully conservative as long as the inflated accretor fits within its Roche lobe, leading stars to behave like hamsters, stuffing excess material behind their expanding cheeks. We suggest a physically motivated prescription for the mass growth of such "hamstars", which can be used to determine mass-transfer efficiency in rapid binary population synthesis models. With this prescription, we estimate that progenitors of high-mass X-ray binaries and gravitational-wave sources may have experienced highly non-conservative mass transfer. In contrast, for low-mass accretors, the accretion timescale can exceed the thermal timescale by a larger factor without causing significant radial expansion.

 - **Abstract**
 Proxima b is a rocky exoplanet in the habitable zone of the nearest star system and a key test case in the search for extraterrestrial life. Here, we investigate the characterization of a potential Earth-like atmosphere around Proxima b in reflected light via molecule mapping, combining high resolution spectroscopy (HRS) and high contrast imaging, using the first-generation integral field spectrograph HARMONI on the $39$-m Extremely Large Telescope. We simulate comprehensive observations of Proxima b at an assumed $45^{\circ}$ inclination using HARMONI's High Contrast Adaptive Optics mode, with spatial resolution $\sim 8$mas ($3.88$mas/spaxel) and spectral resolving power $R\simeq17,000$ between $1.538$--$1.678 \mu m$, containing the spectral features of water, carbon dioxide and methane. Tellurics, stellar features, and additional noise sources are included, and removed using established molecule mapping techniques. We find that HARMONI's current focal plane mask (FPM) is too large and obscures the orbit of Proxima b and thus explore smaller and offset FPMs to yield a detection. A $\rm{S/N}=5$ detection of Proxima b's reflected light, suitable for atmospheric characterisation, is possible with such modifications, requiring a minimum of $20$ hours, but ideally at least $30$ hours of integration time. We highlight that such detections do not scale with the photon noise, hence suitably detailed simulations of future instruments for the ELTs are needed to fully understand their ability to perform HRS observations of exoplanet atmospheres. Alterations to the HARMONI FPM design are feasible at this stage, but must be considered in context of other science cases.
#### Stellar population astrophysics (SPA) with the TNG. Abundance analysis  of nearby red giants and red clump stars: combining high resolution  spectroscopy and asteroseismology

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Asteroseismology, a powerful approach for obtaining internal structure and stellar properties, requires surface temperature and chemical composition information to determine mass and age. High-resolution spectroscopy is a valuable technique for precise stellar parameters (including surface temperature) and chemical composition analysis. Aim: We aim to combine spectroscopic parameters with asteroseismology to test stellar models. Method: Using high-resolution optical and near-IR spectra from GIARPS at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, we conducted a detailed spectroscopic analysis of 16 stars photometrically selected to be on the red giant and red clump. Stellar parameters and chemical abundances for light elements (Li, C, N, F), Fe peak, $\alpha$ and n-capture elements were derived using a combination of equivalent widths and spectral synthesis techniques, based on atomic and molecular features. Ages were determined through asteroseismic scaling relations and compared with ages based on chemical clocks, [Y/Mg] and [C/N]. Results: Spectroscopic parameters confirmed the stars as part of the red giant branch and red clump. Two objects, HD 22045 and HD 24680 exhibited relatively high Li abundances, with HD 24680 potentially being a Li-rich giant resulting from mass transfer with an intermediate-mass companion, which already underwent its AGB phase. Stellar parameters derived from scaling different sets of relations were consistent with each other. For what concerns ages, the values based on asteroseismology were in excellent agreement with those derived from theoretical evolutionary tracks, but did not align with ages derived from the chemical clocks [Y/Mg] and [C/N].

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the confirmation and follow-up characterization of two long-period transiting substellar companions on low-eccentricity orbits around TIC 4672985 and TOI-2529, whose transit events were detected by the TESS space mission. Ground-based photometric and spectroscopic follow-up from different facilities, confirmed the substellar nature of TIC 4672985 b, a massive gas giant, in the transition between the super Jupiters and brown dwarfs mass regime. From the joint analysis we derived the following orbital parameters: P = 69.0480 d, Mp = 12.74 Mjup, Rp = 1.026 Rjup and e = 0.018. In addition, the RV time series revealed a significant trend at the 350 m/s/yr level, which is indicative of the presence of a massive outer companion in the system. TIC 4672985 b is a unique example of a transiting substellar companion with a mass above the deuterium-burning limit, located beyond 0.1 AU and in a nearly circular orbit. These planetary properties are difficult to reproduce from canonical planet formation and evolution models. For TOI-2529 b, we obtained the following orbital parameters: P = 64.5949 d, Mp = 2.340 Mjup, Rp = 1.030 Rjup and e = 0.021, making this object a new example of a growing population of transiting warm giant planets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the spectral analysis of bright steady states in an outburst of the transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (NS-LMXB) Swift J1858.6-0814 observed with NICER. We detected an ionized iron K absorption line (H-like Fe) at 6.97keV in the spectrum. We estimated the photoionization parameter using the ratio of the equivalent widths (EWs) of the FeXXVI (H-like) (17+\-5eV) and FeXXV (He-like) (<3eV) and discuss the origin of the iron absorption line. The irradiated gas producing the absorption line would locate within (3-6)*1E9cm from the X-ray source. We suggest that the observed H-like Fe absorption line originates from the highly-ionized gas in the inner accretion disk in Swift J1858.6-0814.

 - **Abstract**
 The NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) is the primary Digital Library portal for researchers in astronomy and astrophysics. Over the past 30 years, the ADS has gone from being an astronomy-focused bibliographic database to an open digital library system supporting research in space and (soon) earth sciences. This paper describes the evolution of the ADS system, its capabilities, and the technological infrastructure underpinning it. We give an overview of the ADS's original architecture, constructed primarily around simple database models. This bespoke system allowed for the efficient indexing of metadata and citations, the digitization and archival of full-text articles, and the rapid development of discipline-specific capabilities running on commodity hardware. The move towards a cloud-based microservices architecture and an open-source search engine in the late 2010s marked a significant shift, bringing full-text search capabilities, a modern API, higher uptime, more reliable data retrieval, and integration of advanced visualizations and analytics. Another crucial evolution came with the gradual and ongoing incorporation of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing algorithms in our data pipelines. Originally used for information extraction and classification tasks, NLP and ML techniques are now being developed to improve metadata enrichment, search, notifications, and recommendations. we describe how these computational techniques are being embedded into our software infrastructure, the challenges faced, and the benefits reaped. Finally, we conclude by describing the future prospects of ADS and its ongoing expansion, discussing the challenges of managing an interdisciplinary information system in the era of AI and Open Science, where information is abundant, technology is transformative, but their trustworthiness can be elusive.
#### Ultra-deep ATCA imaging of 47 Tucanae reveals a central compact radio  source

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of an ultra-deep radio continuum survey, containing $\sim480$ hours of observations, of the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tucanae with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. This comprehensive coverage of the cluster allows us to reach RMS noise levels of 1.19 $\mu Jy~\textrm{beam}^{-1}$ at 5.5 GHz, 940 $nJy~\textrm{beam}^{-1}$ at 9 GHz, and 790 $nJy~\textrm{beam}^{-1}$ in a stacked 7.25 GHz image. This is the deepest radio image of a globular cluster, and the deepest image ever made with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. We identify ATCA J002405.702-720452.361, a faint ($6.3\pm1.2$ $\mu Jy$ at 5.5 GHz, $5.4\pm0.9$ $\mu Jy$ at 9 GHz), flat-spectrum ($\alpha=-0.31\pm0.54$) radio source that is positionally coincident with the cluster centre and potentially associated with a faint X-ray source. No convincing optical counterpart was identified. We use radio, X-ray, optical, and UV data to show that explanations involving a background active galactic nucleus, a chromospherically active binary, or a binary involving a white dwarf are unlikely. The most plausible explanations are that the source is an undiscovered millisecond pulsar or a weakly accreting black hole. If the X-ray source is associated with the radio source, the fundamental plane of black hole activity suggests a black hole mass of $\sim54-6000$ M$_{\odot}$, indicating an intermediate-mass black hole or a heavy stellar-mass black hole.
#### Formation of Retrograde Hot Jupiter Triggered by Close Encounter with  Tidal Circularization

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09701
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09701
 - **Abstract**
 A new mechanism is proposed to account for the formation of retrograde hot Jupiter in coplanar star-planet system via close encounter between a Jupiter mass planet and a brown dwarf mass planet. After long timescale scattering between several Jupiter mass planets with inner orbits, the remaining planets still rotating around the star could have large semimajor with large eccentricity. If there exists a brown dwarf mass planet in distant orbit around the star, planetary encounter may happen. After encounter, the Jupiter mass planet may rotate around the star in a retrograde orbit with extremely large eccentricity and the periastron can reach 0.01 AU, which means that, within the first several orbits around the star, tidal interaction from the star can shrink the semimajor axis of the planet quickly. Thus, the Jupiter mass planet is isolated from the brown dwarf mass planet due to the quick decrease of its apastron distance and eventually evolves into a retrograde hot Jupiter.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate an SNR W28 with the Suzaku archive data and report the results of spatial resolved analyses. We carry out spectral analysis using a recombining plasma (RP) model with an element-dependent initial ionization temperature, and obtain the ionization temperatures to be $\sim0.5$~keV for Ne, $\sim0.7$~keV for Mg, $\sim1.0$~keV for Si, $\sim1.2$~keV for S, $\sim1.4$~keV for Ar, $\sim1.7$~keV for Ca, and $\sim0.7$~keV for Fe in the RP-initial phase. In addition to northeast regions where RP have been reported, we find that the ionization temperature in the southeast and southwest regions show a similar trend to the central region, in the RP-initial phase. Furthermore, the elapsed time from the RP-initial phase to present is shorter, $\sim300$~yr in the central region and longer, $\sim10^3$-$10^4$~yr in the outside regions. Our results cannot be explained by simple scenarios of thermal conduction due to molecular clouds or adiabatic cooling (rarefaction), and indicate that more complex mechanism or other scenarios are required. Also, we estimate the ejecta mass $\gtrsim14M_{\odot}$, which indicates a SNR derived a massive star.

 - **Abstract**
 The low-energy $\gamma$-ray (0.1-30 MeV) sky has been relatively unexplored since the decommissioning of the COMPTEL instrument on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO) satellite in 2000. However, the study of this part of the energy spectrum (the ``MeV gap") is crucial for addressing numerous unresolved questions in high-energy and multi-messenger astrophysics. Although several large MeV $\gamma$-ray missions like AMEGO and e-ASTROGAM are being proposed, they are predominantly in the developmental phase, with launches not anticipated until the next decade at the earliest. In recent times, there has been a surge in proposed CubeSat missions as cost-effective and rapidly implementable ``pathfinder" alternatives. A MeV CubeSat dedicated to $\gamma$-ray astronomy has the potential to serve as a demonstrator for future, larger-scale MeV payloads. This paper presents a $\gamma$-ray payload design featuring a CdZnTe crystal calorimeter module developed by IDEAS. We report the detailed results of simulations to assess the performance of this proposed payload and compare it with those of previous $\gamma$-ray instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of 9 new hot molecular cores in the Deep South (DS) region of Sagittarius B2 using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 6 observations. We measure the rotational temperature of CH$_3$OH and derive the physical conditions present within these cores and the hot core Sgr B2(S). The cores show heterogeneous temperature structure, with peak temperatures between 252 and 662 K. We find that the cores span a range of masses (203-4842 M$_\odot$) and radii (3587-9436 AU). CH$_3$OH abundances consistently increase with temperature across the sample. Our measurements show the DS hot cores are structurally similar to Galactic Disk hot cores, with radii and temperature gradients that are comparable to sources in the Disk. They also show shallower density gradients than Disk hot cores, which may arise from the Central Molecular Zone's higher density threshold for star formation. The hot cores have properties which are consistent with those of Sgr B2(N), with 3 associated with Class II CH$_3$OH masers and one associated with an UCHII region. Our sample nearly doubles the high-mass star forming gas mass near Sgr B2(S) and suggest the region may be a younger, comparably massive counterpart to Sgr B2(N) and (M). The relationship between peak CH$_3$OH abundance and rotational temperature traced by our sample and a selection of comparable hot cores is qualitatively consistent with predictions from chemical modeling. However, we observe constant peak abundances at higher temperatures ($T \gtrsim 250$ K), which may indicate mechanisms for methanol survival that are not yet accounted for in models.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Slow waves in solar coronal loops are strongly damped. The current theory of damping by thermal conduction cannot explain some observational features.\n Aims. We investigate the propagation of slow waves in a coronal loop built up from strands of different temperatures. \n Methods. We consider the loop to have a multithermal, Gaussian temperature distribution. The different propagation speeds in different strands lead to an multithermal apparent damping of the wave, similar to observational phase mixing. We use an analytical model to predict the damping length and propagation speed for the slow waves, including in imaging with filter telescopes. \n Results. We compare the damping length due to this multithermal apparent damping with damping due to thermal conduction and find that the multithermal apparent damping is more important for shorter period slow waves. We have found the influence of instrument filters on the wave's propagation speed and damping. This allows us to compare our analytical theory to forward models of numerical simulations. \n Conclusions. We find that our analytical model matches the numerical simulations very well. Moreover, we offer an outlook for using the slow wave properties to infer the loop's thermal properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Optical broad-band spectral shape measurements of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are typically made starting an hour or more after the trigger event. With our automated, rapid-response system, the Burst Simultaneous Three-channel Imager (BSTI) on the Nazarbayev University Transient Telescope at Assy-Turgen Astrophysical Observatory (NUTTelA-TAO), we began measurements of GRB200925B 129 s after the Swift BAT trigger. The temporal decay log slopes in the g', r', and i' bands in the time interval 129 s to 1029 s are -0.43 \pm 0.31, -0.43 \pm 0.15, and -0.72 \pm 0.14, respectively. During the decay phase, a shift in color from red to blue, a change in log slope of \{beta} from -2.73 to -1.52 was measured. The evolution in the optical spectral slope is consistent with a decrease in extinction caused by dust destruction.

 - **Abstract**
 Future research studies of cosmic microwave background polarization seems likely to provide a more improved upper bound of $r \le 0.03$ on the tensor-to-scalar ratio(r). In our work, we have done the reheating study of mutated hilltop inflation(MHI), a model falling in the broad category of small field inflation. We have parameterized reheating in terms of various parameters like reheating duration $N_{\text{rh}}$, reheating temperature $T_{\text{rh}}$ and effective equation of state $\overline{\omega }_{\text{rh}}$ using observationally viable values of scalar power spectrum amplitude $A_{\text{s}}$ and scalar spectral index $n_{\text{s}}$. In our study, working over a range of $\overline{\omega }_{\text{rh}}$, we found that the MHI potential is well consistent with combined Planck and BK18 observations for $\overline{\omega }_{\text{rh}} > 0$ within a particular range of model's parameter space and the lower values of the model parameter in MHI generate considerably smaller r compared to normal hilltop potential without any incompatibility of $n_s$ with observational data, making MHI a better choice in accordance to recent and future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The initial-final mass relation (IFMR) plays a crucial role in understanding stellar structure and evolution by linking a star's initial mass to the mass of the resulting white dwarf. This study explores the IFMR in the initial mass range $0.8 \leq M_\mathrm{ini} / M_\odot \leq 4$ using full PARSEC evolutionary calculations supplemented with COLIBRI computations to complete the ejection of the envelope and obtain the final core mass. Recent works have shown that the supposed monotonicity of the IFMR is interrupted by a kink in the initial mass range $M_\mathrm{ini} \approx 1.65-2.10 M_\odot$, due to the interaction between recurrent dredge-up episodes and stellar winds in carbon stars evolving on the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase. To reproduce the IFMR non-monotonic behavior we investigate the role of convective overshooting efficiency applied to the base of the convective envelope ($f_\mathrm{env}$) and to the borders of the pulse-driven convective zone ($f_\mathrm{pdcz}$), as well as its interplay with mass loss. We compare our models to observational data and find that $f_\mathrm{env}$ must vary with initial mass in order to accurately reproduce the IFMR's observed kink and slopes. We find some degeneracy between the overshooting parameters when only the IFMR information is used. Nonetheless, this analysis provides valuable insights into the internal mixing processes during the TP-AGB phase.

 - **Abstract**
 The temperature of the interstellar medium (ISM) is governed by several physical process, among which radiative cooling, external UV/cosmic ray heating, and the mechanical work by compression and expansion. In regimes where the dynamical effect is important, the temperature deviates from that derived by simply balancing the heating and cooling functions. This renders the expression of the gas energy evolution with a simple equation of state (EOS) less straightforward. Given a cooling function, the behavior of the gas is subject to the combined effect of dynamical compression and radiative cooling. The goal of the present work is to derive the effective EOS of a collapsing gas within a full fluid solution. We solve the Navier-Stokes equations with a parametric cooling term in spherical coordinate and look for a self-similar collapse solution. We present a solution which describes a cloud that is contracting while losing energy through radiation. This yields an effective EOS that can be generally applied to various ISM context, where the cooling function is available from first principles, and expressed as powerlaw product of the density and temperature. Our findings suggest that a radiatively cooling gas under self-gravitating collapse can easily manifest an effective polytropic EOS, even isothermal in many scenarios. The present model provides theoretical justification for the simplifying isothermal assumptions of simulations at various scales, and can also provide a more realistic thermal recipe without additional computation cost.

 - **Abstract**
 In a born-again planetary nebula (PN), processed H-deficient material has been injected inside the old, H-rich nebula as a result of a very late thermal pulse (VLTP) event. Long-slit spectra have been used to unveil the chemical and physical differences between these two structures, but the ejection and shaping processes remain still unclear. In order to peer into the morpho-kinematics of the H-deficient ejecta in the born-again PN A 58, we present the first integral field spectroscopic observations of a born-again PN as obtained with GTC MEGARA. We detect emission from the H$\alpha$, He I, [O III], [N II] and [S II] emission lines, which help us unveil the expansion patterns of the different structures. In combination with ALMA and Hubble Space Telescope data we are able to produce a complete view of the H-deficient ionized and molecular ejecta in A 58. We propose an hourglass structure for the ionized material that embraces molecular high-velocity polar components, while bisected by an expanding toroidal molecular and dusty structure. Our results leverage the role of a companion in shaping the VLTP ejecta in this born-again PN.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar aromatic molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic nitrogen and oxygen bearing molecules are thought to be abundant in the interstellar medium. In this class of molecules, benzonitrile ($c$-C$_6$H$_5$CN) plays an important role as a proxy for benzene. It has been detected through rotational emission in several astrophysical sources and is one of the simplest N-bearing polar aromatic molecules. Even in the cold ISM, the population of the rotational levels of benzonitrile might not be at equilibrium. Consequently, modeling its detected emission lines requires a prior computation of its quenching rate coefficients by the most abundant species in the ISM (He or H$_2$). In this paper, we focus on the excitation of c-C$_6$H$_5$CN by collision with He. We compute the first potential energy surface (PES) using the explicitly correlated coupled cluster method in conjunction with large basis sets. The PES obtained is characterized by a potential well depth of -97.2 cm$^{-1}$ and an important anisotropy. Scattering computations of the rotational (de-)excitation of c-C$_6$H$_5$CN by He atoms are performed by means of the coupled states approximation that allow to obtain collisional rates for rotational states up to $j$ = 9 and temperatures up to 40 K. These rate coefficients are then used to examine the effect of C$_6$H$_5$CN excitation induced by collisions with para-H$_2$ in molecular clouds by carrying out simple radiative transfer calculations of the excitation temperatures and show that non-equilibrium effects can be expected for H$_2$ densities up to 10$^5$-10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The notion of liquid water beneath the ice layer at the south polar layered deposits of Mars is an interesting possibility given the implications for astrobiology, and possible human habitation. A body of liquid water located at a depth of 1.5 km has been inferred from radar data in the South Polar Cap. However, the high temperatures that would facilitate the existence of liquid water or brine at that depth are not consistent with estimations of heat flow that are based on the lithosphere's flexure. Attempts to reconcile both issues have been inconclusive or otherwise unsuccessful. Here, we analyse the possible role of subsurface ammonia and methanol in maintaining water in a liquid state at subsurface temperatures that are compatible with the lithosphere strength. Our results indicate that the presence of these compounds at the base of the south polar layered deposits can reconcile the existence of liquid water with previous estimations of surface heat flow.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiband photometric investigations for eight binary systems of the W Ursae Majoris (W UMa)-type are presented. Six systems are presented for the first time to analyze their light curves. All the analyzed systems have a temperature below 5000 K and an orbital period of less than 0.28 days. We extracted primary and secondary minima from the ground-based observations of these systems. According to a few observations reported in the literature, linear fits were considered in the O-C diagrams, and new ephemerides were presented. Light curve solutions were performed using the PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) code. The results of the mass ratio and fillout factor indicate that the systems are contact binary stars. Six of them showed the O'Connell effect, and a cold starspot on each companion was required for light curve solutions. Their absolute parameters were estimated and evaluated by two other methods. In this study, the empirical relationship between the orbital period and semi-major axis was updated using a sample consisting of 414 contact binary systems and the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approach. Also, using Machine Learning (ML) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, the relationship between $P-T_1-M_1$ was updated for a better estimation of the mass of the primary star.

 Spider pulsars continue to provide promising candidates for neutron star mass measurements. Here we present the discovery of PSR~J1910$-$5320, a new millisecond pulsar discovered in a MeerKAT observation of an unidentified \textit{Fermi}-LAT gamma-ray source. This pulsar is coincident with a recently identified candidate redback binary, independently discovered through its periodic optical flux and radial velocity. New multi-color optical light curves obtained with ULTRACAM/NTT in combination with MeerKAT timing and updated SOAR/Goodman spectroscopic radial velocity measurements allow a mass constraint for PSR~J1910$-$5320. \texttt{Icarus} optical light curve modelling, with streamlined radial velocity fitting, constrains the orbital inclination and companion velocity, unlocking the binary mass function given the precise radio ephemeris. Our modelling aims to unite the photometric and spectroscopic measurements available by fitting each simultaneously to the same underlying physical model, ensuring self-consistency. This targets centre-of-light radial velocity corrections necessitated by the irradiation endemic to spider systems. Depending on the gravity darkening prescription used, we find a moderate neutron star mass of either $1.6\pm0.2$ or $1.4\pm0.2$ $M_\odot$. The companion mass of either $0.45\pm0.04$ or $0.43^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ $M_\odot$ also further confirms PSR~J1910$-$5320 as an irradiated redback spider pulsar.radiated redback spider pulsar.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first interstellar identification of protonated acetylene, C2H3+, a fundamental hydrocarbon, in the z=0.89 molecular absorber toward the gravitationally lensed quasar PKS1830-211. The molecular species is identified from clear absorption features corresponding to the 2_12-1_01 (rest frequency 494.034 GHz) and 1_11-0_00 (431.316 GHz) ground-state transitions of ortho and para forms of C2H3+, respectively, in ALMA spectra toward the southwestern image of PKS1830-211, where numerous molecules, including other hydrocarbons, have already been detected. From the simple assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) with cosmic microwave background photons and an ortho-to-para ratio of three, we estimate a total C2H3+ column density of 2 x 10^12 cm^-2 and an abundance of 10^-10 compared to H_2. However, formation pumping could affect the population of metastable states, yielding a C2H3+ column density higher than the LTE value by a factor of a few. We explore possible routes to the formation of C2H3+, mainly connected to acetylene and methane, and find that the methane route is more likely in PDR environment. As one of the initial hydrocarbon building blocks, C2H3+ is thought to play an important role in astrochemistry, in particular in the formation of more complex organic molecules.

 - **Abstract**
 Ejection of large boulder-like debris is a vigorous form of cometary activity that is unlikely induced by water ice out-gassing alone but rather associated with the sublimation of super-volatile ices. Though perceived on several comets, actual pattern and mechanism of such activity are still unclear. Here we report on a specialized observation of ejections of decimeter- to meter-sized boulders on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko outbound between 2.5 and 3.3 AU from the Sun. With a common source region, these events recurred in local morning. The boulders of elongated shapes were ejected in clusters at low inclinations comparable to the solar elevation below 40 degrees at the time. We show that these chunks could be propelled by the surrounding, asymmetric gas field that produced a distinct lateral acceleration. Possibly both water and carbon dioxide have contributed to their mobilization, while the season and local topography are among deciding factors. The mechanisms for sustaining regular activity of comets at large heliocentric distances are likely more diverse and intricate than previously thought.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. Measuring dynamical masses of substellar companions is a powerful tool to test models of mass-luminosity-age relations, as well as determining observational features that constrain the boundary between stellar and substellar companions. In order to dynamically constrain the mass of such companions, we use multiple exoplanet measurement techniques to remove degeneracies in the orbital fits of these objects and place tight constraints on their model-independent masses. Methods. We combine long-period radial-velocity data from the CORALIE survey with relative astrometry from direct imaging with VLT/SPHERE, along with astrometric accelerations from Hipparcos-Gaia eDR3 to perform a combined orbital fit and measure precise dynamical masses of two newly discovered benchmark brown dwarfs. Results. We report the discovery of HD112863B and HD206505B, which are two new benchmark likely brown dwarfs that sit at the substellar-stellar boundary, with precise dynamical masses. We perform an orbital fit which yields dynamical masses for HD112863B and HD206505B to be $77.1^{+2.9}_{-2.8}~M_{\rm{Jup}}$ and $79.8\pm1.8~M_{\rm{Jup}}$ respectively. The orbital period for HD112863B is determined to be $21.59\pm0.05$ years and the orbital period of HD206505B is determined to be ${50.9}_{-1.5}^{+1.7}$ years. From the $H$ and $K$ band photometry from IRDIS data taken with VLT/SPHERE, we estimate the spectral types of both HD112863B and HD206505B to be early-mid L-types.

 - **Abstract**
 We show how to significantly improve difference image analysis (DIA) of gravitationally lensed quasars over long periods of time using Gaia proper motions. DIA requires the subtraction of a reference image from the individual images of a monitoring campaign, using stars in the field to align the images. Since the proper motion of the stars can be of the same order as the pixel size during a several-year campaign, we use Gaia DR3 proper motions to enable a correct image alignment. The proper motion corrected star positions can be aligned by the ISIS package. DIA is carried out using the HOTPAnTS package. We apply point spread function (PSF) photometry to obtain light curves and add a proper motion correction of the PSF star to GALFIT. We apply our method to the light curves of the three gravitationally lensed quasars HE1104-1805, HE2149-2745 and Q2237+0305 in the R and V band, respectively, obtained using 1 m telescopes of the Las Cumbres Observatory from 2014 to 2022. We show that the image alignment and the determination of the lensed quasar positions is significantly improved by this method. The light curves of individual quasar images display intrinsic quasar variations and are affected by chromatic microlensing.

 - **Abstract**
 The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and the upcoming PLATO mission (PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars) represent two space-based missions with complementary objectives in the field of exoplanet science. While TESS aims at detecting and characterizing exoplanets around bright and nearby stars on a relative short-period orbit, PLATO will discover a wide range of exoplanets including rocky planets within the habitable zones of their stars. We analyze mono-transit events in TESS data around stars that will or could be monitored by the PLATO mission, offering a unique opportunity to bridge the knowledge gap between the two missions and gain deeper insights into exoplanet demographics and system architectures. We found $48$ TESS mono-transit events around stars contained in the all-sky PLATO Input Catalog; of these, at least four will be imaged on the first long-pointing PLATO field, LOPS2. We uniformly vetted this sample to rule out possible false positive detections thus removing $10$ signals from the original sample. We developed an analytic method which allows us to estimate both the orbital period and inclination of a mono-transit planet candidate using only the shape of the transit. We derived the orbital period and inclination estimates for $30$ TESS mono-transit planet candidates. Finally, we investigated whether these candidates are amenable targets for a CHEOPS observing campaign.

 - **Abstract**
 The rotational energy of a fluid parcel changes during isotropic expansion or compression. In solar convection, rotation absorbs energy from convection and inhibits it, causing the motion of fluid parcels larger than a critical size to become vibration. Turbulence and inertial oscillations can cause the deformation of fluid parcels to deviate from isotropic, altering the equilibrium position of the vibration and forming motion larger than the critical size, respectively, the large granules within the granules and probably the mesogranulation. The change in rotational energy of granules during convection causes their rotation speed to differ from the local speed, forming a statistically significant solar radial differential rotation. The meridional circulation driven by radial differential rotation transports angular momentum towards the equator, forming the latitudinal differential rotation. A model constructed by combining mixing length theory explains why granule size and temperature distribution are independent of latitude, and the structure produced by this mechanism is similar to the characteristics of supergranules.

 - **Abstract**
 Short GRBs are produced by relativistic jets arising from binary NS-NS or NS-BH mergers. Since the detection of the first unambiguous off-axis GRB 170817A, we learned that energy distribution in the jet plays an important role in explaining the GRB emission. The structure and dynamics are modified during the first seconds of the jet interaction with a post-merger environment. Conventional studies often assume this environment as a simple homologous and symmetrically expanding wind. However, post-merger outflows exhibit complex dynamics influenced by the accretion disc evolution. Moreover, the r-process nucleosynthesis influences the thermodynamics and properties of the post-merger neutron-rich environment. In this work, we study the impact of realistic post-merger disc outflow over the jet dynamics at large scales. We find the results are substantially different from the typical model with symmetric homologous wind.

 - **Abstract**
 Young protostars that undergo episodic accretion can provide insight into the impact on their circumstellar environments while matter is accreted from the disk onto the protostar. IRAS 22343+7501 is a four component protostar system with one of those being a fading outbursting protostar referred to as L1251 VLA 6. Given the rarity of YSOs undergoing this type of accretion, L1251 VLA 6 can elucidate the fading phase of the post-outburst process. Here we examine structure in the disk around L1251 VLA 6 at frequencies of 10 GHz and 33 GHz with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We model the disk structure using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This method is then combined with a parametric ray-tracing code to generate synthetic model images of an axisymmetric disk, allowing us to characterize the radial distribution of dust in the system. The results of our MCMC fit show that the most probable values for the mass and radius are consistent with values typical of Class I objects. We find that the total mass of the disk is $0.070^{+0.031}_{-0.2} \rm ~ M_{\sun}$ and investigate the conditions that could cause the accretion outburst. We conclude that the eruption is not caused by gravitational instability and consider alternative explanations and trigger mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Imaging interferometric data in radio astronomy requires the use of non-linear algorithms that rely on different assumptions on the source structure and may produce non-unique results. This is especially true for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations, where the sampling of Fourier space is very sparse. A basic tenet in standard VLBI imaging techniques is to assume that the observed source structure does not evolve during the observation. However, the recent VLBI results of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at our Galactic Center (Sagittarius A$^*$, SgrA*), recently reported by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC), require the development of dynamic imaging algorithms, since it exhibits variability at minute timescales. In this paper, we introduce a new non-convex optimization problem that extends the standard Maximum Entropy Method (MEM), for reconstructing intra-observation dynamical images from interferometric data that evolves in every integration time. We present a rigorous mathematical formalism to solve the problem via the primal-dual approach. We build a Newton strategy and we give its numerical complexity. We also give a strategy to iteratively improve the obtained solution and finally, we define a novel figure of merit to evaluate the quality of the recovered solution. Then, we test the algorithm, called ngMEM, in different synthetic datasets, with increasing difficulty. Finally, we compare it with another well-established dynamical imaging method. Within this comparison we identified a significant improvement of the ngMEM reconstructions. Moreover, the evaluation of the integration time evolution scheme and the time contribution showed to play a crucial role for obtaining good dynamic reconstructions.

 - **Abstract**
 While the standard X-ray variability of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) is stochastic and noisy, there are two known BHXBs that exhibit exotic `heartbeat'-like variability in their light curves: GRS 1915+105 and IGR J17091-3624. In 2022, IGR J17091-3624 went into outburst for the first time in the NICER/NuSTAR era. These exquisite data allow us to simultaneously track the exotic variability and the corresponding spectral features with unprecedented detail. We find that as in typical BHXBs, the outburst began in the hard state, then the intermediate state, but then transitioned to an exotic soft state where we identify two types of heartbeat-like variability (Class V and a new Class X). The flux-energy spectra show a broad iron emission line due to relativistic reflection when there is no exotic variability, and absorption features from highly ionized iron when the source exhibits exotic variability. Whether absorption lines from highly ionized iron are detected in IGR J17091-3624 is not determined by the spectral state alone, but rather is determined by the presence of exotic variability; in a soft spectral state, absorption lines are only detected along with exotic variability. Our finding indicates that IGR J17091-3624 can be seen as a bridge between the most peculiar BHXB GRS 1915+105 and `normal' BHXBs because it alternates between the conventional and exotic behavior of BHXBs. We discuss the physical nature of the absorbing material and exotic variability in light of this new legacy dataset.

 IGR J17091-3624 is a black hole X-ray binary (BHXB), often referred to as the 'twin' of GRS 1915+105 because it is the only other known BHXB that can show exotic 'heartbeat'-like variability that is highly structured and repeated. Here we report on observations of IGR J17091-3624 from its 2022 outburst, where we detect an unusually coherent quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) when the broadband variability is low (total fractional rms $\lesssim$ 6%) and the spectrum is dominated by the accretion disk. Such spectral and variability behavior is characteristic of the soft state of typical BHXBs (i.e., those that do not show heartbeats), but we also find that this QPO is strongest when there is some exotic heartbeat-like variability (so-called Class V variability). This QPO is detected at frequencies between 5 and 8 Hz and has Q-factors (defined as the QPO frequency divided by the width) $\gtrsim$ 50, making it one of the most highly coherent low-frequency QPO ever seen in a BHXB. The extremely high Q factor makes this QPO distinct from typical low-frequency QPOs that are conventionally classified into Type-A/B/C QPOs. Instead, we find evidence that archival observations of GRS 1915+105 also showed a similarly high-coherence QPO in the same frequency range, suggesting that this unusually coherent and strong QPO may be unique to BHXBs that can exhibit 'heartbeat'-like variability.

 - **Abstract**
 By measuring photoelectron tracks, the gas pixel detectors of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer satellite provide estimates of the photon detection location and its electric vector position angle (EVPA). However, imperfections in reconstructing event positions blur the image and EVPA-position correlations result in artificial polarized halos around bright sources. We introduce a new model describing this "polarization leakage" and use it to recover the on-orbit telescope point-spread functions, useful for faint source detection and image reconstruction. These point spread functions are more accurate than previous approximations or ground-calibrated products ($\Delta \chi^2\approx 3\times 10^{4}$ and $4 \times 10^4$ respectively for a bright $10^6$-count source). We also define an algorithm for polarization leakage correction substantially more accurate than existing prescriptions ($\Delta \chi^2\approx 1\times 10^{3}$). These corrections depend on the reconstruction method, and we supply prescriptions for the mission-standard "Moments" methods as well as for "Neural Net" event reconstruction. Finally, we present a method to isolate leakage contributions to polarization observations of extended sources and show that an accurate PSF allows the extraction of sub-PSF-scale polarization patterns.
