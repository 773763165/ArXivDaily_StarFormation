 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by recent measurements of the free-floating planet mass function at terrestrial masses, we consider the possibility that the solar system may have captured a terrestrial planet early in its history. We show that $\sim 1.2$ captured free-floating planets with mass strictly greater than that of Mars may exist in the outer solar system, with a median predicted distance of $\sim 1400 \mathrm{\; AU}$. If we consider a logarithmic bin centered on the mass of Mars, rather than a cutoff, we find that $\sim 2.7$ captured free-floating planets with mass comparable to Mars may exist in the outer solar system. We derive an expectation value of $\sim 0.9$ for the number of captured free-floating planets with mass comparable to that of Mars ($\sim 1.4$ for mass comparable to that of Mercury) that are currently brighter than the 10-year co-added point source detection limits of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Blind shift-and-stack searches could potentially enable the detection of such a planet if it is currently in the Southern sky. The theoretical argument presented here does not rely on the existence of posited patterns in the orbital elements of small bodies in and beyond the Kuiper belt, in contrast with other hypothetical outer-solar-system planets motivated in recent years.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary evolution codes are essential tools to help in understanding the evolution of binary systems. They contain a great deal of physics, for example stellar evolution, stellar interactions, mass transfer, tides, orbital evolution. Since many of these processes are difficult to account for in detail, we often rely on prescriptions obtained in earlier studies. We highlight that the impact of the dynamical tides with radiative damping has been implemented inconsistently with respect to its original theoretical formulation in many studies. We derive a new analytical solution for the evolution toward synchronization in the case of circular orbits and propose turnkey equations for the case of eccentric orbits that can be used in population synthesis studies. We compare the strength of the tidal torque obtained with this new formula with respect to that obtained with the formula generally used in literature by studying how the evolution toward synchronization of main sequence stellar models is affected. We conclude that by using an incorrect formula for the tidal torque, as has been done in many binary codes, the strength of the dynamical tides with radiative damping is over- or underestimated depending on whether the star is close to or far from synchronization.
#### Quasars as Standard Candles V. Evaluation of a $\leq$ 0.06 dex intrinsic  dispersion in the LX-LUV relation

 - **Abstract**
 A characteristic feature of quasars is the observed non-linear relationship between their monochromatic luminosities at rest-frame 2500 {\AA} and 2 keV. This relationship is evident across all redshifts and luminosities and, due to its non-linearity, can be implemented to estimate quasar distances and construct a Hubble Diagram for quasars. Historically, a significant challenge in the cosmological application of this relation has been its high observed dispersion. Recent studies have demonstrated that this dispersion can be reduced by excluding biased objects from the sample. Nevertheless, the dispersion remains considerable ($\delta \sim 0.20$ dex), especially when compared to the Phillips relation for supernovae Ia. Given the absence of a comprehensive physical model for the relation, it remains unclear how much of the remaining dispersion is intrinsically tied to the relation itself and how much can be attributed to observational factors not addressed by the sample selection and by the choice of X-ray and UV indicators. Potential contributing factors include (i) the scatter produced by using X-ray photometric results instead of spectroscopic ones, (ii) the intrinsic variability of quasars, and (iii) the inclination of the accretion disc relative to our line of sight. In this study, we thoroughly examine these three factors and quantify their individual contributions to the observed dispersion. Based on our findings, we argue that the intrinsic dispersion of the X-ray/UV luminosity relation is likely below 0.06 dex. We also discuss why high-redshift subsamples can show a significantly lower dispersion than the average one.
#### An Estimate of the Impact of Reionization on Supermassive Black Hole  Growth

 - **Abstract**
 The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that power active galactic nuclei found at $z\geq 6$ were formed during the epoch of reionization. Because reionization is a spatially inhomogeneous process, where different regions of the Universe become reionized at different times, the physical properties of SMBH host galaxy environments will vary spatially during reionization. We construct a semi-analytic model to estimate the impact of reionization on SMBH growth due to reduced gas accretion onto dark matter halos. Using a series of merger trees, reionization models, and black hole growth models, we find that early reionization can reduce an SMBH's mass by up to [50, 70, 90] % within dark matter halos of mass [$10^{12}$, $10^{11}$, $10^{10}$] M$_{\odot}$ by $z$ = 6. Our findings also suggest that the redshift range in which black hole growth is impacted by reionization is strongly dependent on whether the Eddington accretion rate can be exceeded. If so, we find that black hole masses are significantly suppressed principally during the early phases of reionization ($z$ $\gtrsim$ 10), while they are more readily suppressed across the full redshift range if super-Eddington growth is not allowed. We find that the global average impact of reionization may be to reduce the masses of black holes residing in $\lesssim$ 10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ halos by a factor of $\gtrsim$ 2. The census of SMBHs that the James Webb Space Telescope is uncovering provides a promising means by which to test these predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 The variations in Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity observed at $z>5.3$ between lines of sight to different background quasars are too strong to be caused by fluctuations in the density field alone. The leading hypothesis for the cause of this excess variance is a late, ongoing reionization process at redshifts below six. Another model proposes strong ionizing background fluctuations coupled to a short, spatially varying mean free path of ionizing photons, without explicitly invoking incomplete reionization. With recent observations suggesting a short mean free path at $z\sim6$, and a dramatic improvement in $z>5$ Ly$\alpha$ forest data quality, we revisit this latter possibility. Here we apply the likelihood-free inference technique of approximate Bayesian computation to jointly constrain the hydrogen photoionization rate $\Gamma_{\rm HI}$ and the mean free path of ionizing photons $\lambda_{\rm mfp}$ from the effective optical depth distributions at $z=5.0$-$6.1$ from XQR-30. We find that the observations are well-described by fluctuating mean free path models with average mean free paths that are consistent with the steep trend implied by independent measurements at $z\sim5$-$6$, with a concomitant rapid evolution of the photoionization rate.
#### Exact treatment of weak dark matter-baryon scattering for  linear-cosmology observables

 - **Abstract**
 Elastic scattering of dark matter (DM) particles with baryons induce cosmological signals that may be detectable with modern or future telescopes. For DM-baryon scattering cross sections scaling with negative powers of relative velocity, $\sigma_{\chi b}(v) \propto v^{-2}, v^{-4}$, such interactions introduce a momentum-exchange rate that is nonlinear in DM-baryon bulk relative velocities, thus not amenable for inclusion as-is into standard linear cosmological Boltzmann codes. Linear ansatzes have been adopted in past works, but their accuracy is unknown as they do not arise from first-principles derivations. In this work, for the first time, we construct a rigorous framework for computing linear-cosmology observables as a perturbative expansion in $\sigma_{\chi b}$. We argue that this approach is accurate for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) angular power spectra when most or all of the DM is scattering with baryons with cross section $\sigma_{\chi b}(v) \propto v^{-2}, v^{-4}$. We derive exact formal expressions for CMB power spectra at linear order in $\sigma_{\chi b}$, and show that they only depend on a specific velocity integral of the momentum-exchange rate. Consequently, we can obtain the exact power spectra at linear order in $\sigma_{\chi b}$ by substituting the original nonlinear momentum-exchange rate with a uniquely specified linear rate. Serendipitously, we find that the exact substitution we derive from first principles precisely coincides with the most widely used linear ansatz, thus placing previous CMB-anisotropy upper bounds on a more solid footing. In addition to finally providing an exact cosmological solution to the DM-baryon scattering problem in a well-defined region of parameter space, the framework we construct opens the way to computing higher-order correlation functions, beyond power spectra, which are promising yet unexplored probes of DM-baryon scattering.
#### A systematic search for double eclipsing binaries in Zwicky Transient  Facility data

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Double eclipsing binaries are gravitationally bound quadruple systems in a 2+2 configuration where both of the binaries are eclipsing. These systems are interesting objects to better understand stellar formation, to investigate the dynamical interaction between the two binary systems or to study certain stages of stellar evolution. Aims. With this work, we aim to determine if double eclipsing binaries can be found using ZTF data and what the difficulties are in doing so. Secondly, we aim to significantly increase the number of known double eclipsing systems and determine how this sample differs from samples of double eclipsing binaries found with other telescopes. Methods. We develop a new method to systematically search for double eclipsing binaries in sparsely sampled light curves. For this we use box-least-squares (BLS) to search for the period of the first binary in the system. We then remove that signal from the light curves, and search the residual light curve again with BLS to find the second period. We applied this method to ZTF light curves of 575 526 eclipsing binaries known in the Gaia eclipsing binary catalogue. Results. We report the discovery of 198 new double eclipsing binary systems. Conclusions. We successfully implemented a method that systematically searches for double eclipsing binary systems in sparsely sampled data. In total 198 new double eclipsing binary systems have been found in 575 526 light curves. The ZTF sample typically contains more short period binaries compared to the TESS sample, but is also able to find systems with longer periods. We expect that at least three to four times more quadruples can be found by applying this method to all ZTF stellar light curves, by increasing the number of data points as a result of longer observations, and by implementing an automatic detection mechanism that replaces visual inspection.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of statistical tools for evaluating tensions in cosmological parameter estimates arising from distinct datasets. Focusing on the unresolved Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension, we explore the Pantheon Plus + SH0ES (PPS) compilation, which includes low-redshift Cepheid data from the SH0ES collaboration, and the Cosmic Chronometers (CC) dataset. Employing various tension metrics, we quantitatively assess the inconsistencies in parameter estimates, emphasizing the importance of capturing multidimensional tensions. Our results reveal substantial tension between PPS and Planck 2018 datasets. We highlight the importance of the adoption of these metrics to enhance the precision of future cosmological analyses and facilitate the resolution of existing tensions.

 - **Abstract**
 M 39 is a nearby young open cluster hardly studied in the last decades. No giant is known among its members and its chemical composition has never been studied. In order to investigate it we performed high-resolution spectroscopy of 20 expected cluster members with the HARPS and FIES spectrographs. By combining our observations with archival photometry and $Gaia$-DR3 data we searched for evolved members and studied cluster properties such as the radial velocity, extinction and age. For the first time, we provide stellar parameters and chemical abundances for 21 species with atomic numbers up to 56. We have not found any new giant as likely member and notice a negligible reddening along the cluster field, that we place at 300 pc. We obtain a mean radial velocity for M 39 of -5.5$\pm$0.5 km s$^{-1}$ and an isochrone-fitting age of 430$\pm$110 Ma, which corresponds to a MSTO mass of around 2.8 Msol. This value is consistent with the Li content and chromospheric activity shown by its members. Based on main-sequence stars the cluster exhibits a solar composition, [Fe/H]=+0.04$\pm$0.08 dex, compatible with its Galactocentric location. However, it has a slightly subsolar abundance of Na and an enriched content of neutron-capture elements, specially Ba. In any case, the chemical composition of M 39 is fully compatible with that shown by other open clusters that populate the Galactic thin disc

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational microlensing technique is most sensitive to planets in a Jupiter-like orbit and has detected more than 200 planets. However, only a few wide-orbit ($s > 2$) microlensing planets have been discovered, where $s$ is the planet-to-host separation normalized to the angular Einstein ring radius, $\theta_{\rm E}$. Here we present the discovery and analysis of a strong candidate wide-orbit microlensing planet in the event, OGLE-2017-BLG-0448. The whole light curve exhibits long-term residuals to the static binary-lens single-source model, so we investigate the residuals by adding the microlensing parallax, microlensing xallarap, an additional lens, or an additional source. For the first time, we observe a complex degeneracy between all four effects. The wide-orbit models with $s \sim 2.5$ and a planet-to-host mass-ratio of $q \sim 10^{-4}$ are significantly preferred, but we cannot rule out the close models with $s \sim 0.35$ and $q \sim 10^{-3}$. A Bayesian analysis based on a Galactic model indicates that, despite the complicated degeneracy, the surviving wide-orbit models all contain a super-Earth-mass to Neptune-mass planet at a projected planet-host separation of $\sim 6$ au and the surviving close-orbit models all consist of a Jovian-mass planet at $\sim 1$ au. The host star is probably an M or K dwarf. We discuss the implications of this dimension-degeneracy disaster on microlensing light-curve analysis and its potential impact on statistical studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe how a novel online changepoint detection algorithm, called Poisson-FOCuS, can be used to optimally detect gamma-ray bursts within the computational constraints imposed by miniaturized satellites such as the upcoming HERMES-Pathfinder constellation. Poisson-FOCuS enables testing for gamma-ray burst onset at all intervals in a count time series, across all timescales and offsets, in real-time and at a fraction of the computational cost of conventional strategies. We validate an implementation with automatic background assessment through exponential smoothing, using archival data from Fermi-GBM. Through simulations of lightcurves modeled after real short and long gamma-ray bursts, we demonstrate that the same implementation has higher detection power than algorithms designed to emulate the logic of Fermi-GBM and Compton-BATSE, reaching the performances of a brute-force benchmark with oracle information on the true background rate, when not hindered by automatic background assessment. Finally, using simulated data with different lengths and means, we show that Poisson-FOCuS can analyze data twice as fast as a similarly implemented benchmark emulator for the historic Fermi-GBM on-board trigger algorithms.
#### The GRAVITY young stellar object survey: XI. Imaging the hot gas  emission around the Herbig Ae star HD 58647

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to investigate the origin of the HI Br$\gamma$ emission in young stars by using GRAVITY to image the innermost region of circumstellar disks, where important physical processes such as accretion and winds occur. With high spectral and angular resolution, we focus on studying the continuum and the HI Br$\gamma$-emitting area of the Herbig star HD58647. Using VLTI-GRAVITY, we conducted observations of HD58647 with both high spectral and high angular resolution. Thanks to the extensive $uv$ coverage, we were able to obtain detailed images of the circumstellar environment at a sub-au scale, specifically capturing the continuum and the Br$\gamma$-emitting region. Through the analysis of velocity-dispersed images and photocentre shifts, we were able to investigate the kinematics of the HI Br$\gamma$-emitting region. The recovered continuum images show extended emission where the disk major axis is oriented along a position angle of 14\degr. The size of the continuum emission at 5-sigma levels is $\sim$ 1.5 times more extended than the sizes reported from geometrical fitting (3.69 mas $\pm$ 0.02 mas). This result supports the existence of dust particles close to the stellar surface, screened from the stellar radiation by an optically thick gaseous disk. Moreover, for the first time with GRAVITY, the hot gas component of HD58647 traced by the Br$\gamma$ ,has been imaged. This allowed us to constrain the size of the Br$\gamma$-emitting region and study the kinematics of the hot gas; we find its velocity field to be roughly consistent with gas that obeys Keplerian motion. The velocity-dispersed images show that the size of the hot gas emission is from a more compact region than the continuum (2.3 mas $\pm$ 0.2 mas). Finally, the line phases show that the emission is not entirely consistent with Keplerian rotation, hinting at a more complex structure in the hot gaseous disk.
#### Delayed and fast rising radio flares from an optical and X-ray detected  tidal disruption event in the center of a dwarf galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 AT2018cqh is a unique tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate discovered in a dwarf galaxy. Both the light curve fitting and galaxy scaling relationships suggest a central black hole mass in the range of 5.9<logM_BH/M_sun<6.4. A delayed X-ray brightening was found around 590 days after the optical discovery, but shows unusual long-time rising to peak over at least 558 days, which could be coming from delayed accretion of a newly forming debris disk. We report the discovery of delayed radio flares around 1105 days since its discovery, characterized by an initial steep rise of ~>175 days, a flattening lasting about 544 days, and a phase with another steep rise. The rapid rise in radio flux coupled with the slow decay in the X-ray emission points to a delayed launching of outflow, perhaps due to a transition in the accretion state. However, known accretion models can hardly explain the origins of the secondary radio flare that is rising even more rapidly in comparison with the initial one. If confirmed, AT2018cqh would be a rare TDE in a dwarf galaxy exhibiting optical, X-ray and radio flares. We call for continued multi-frequency radio observations to monitor its spectral and temporal evolution, which may help to reveal new physical processes that are not included in standard TDE models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present $\texttt{Miko}$, a catalog-to-cosmology pipeline for general flat-sky field-level inference, which provides access to cosmological information beyond the two-point statistics. In the context of weak lensing, we identify several new field-level analysis systematics (such as aliasing, Fourier mode-coupling, and density-induced shape noise), quantify their impact on cosmological constraints, and correct the biases to a percent level. Next, we find that model mis-specification can lead to both absolute bias and incorrect uncertainty quantification for the inferred cosmological parameters in realistic simulations. The Gaussian map prior infers unbiased cosmological parameters, regardless of the true data distribution, but it yields over-confident uncertainties. The log-normal map prior quantifies the uncertainties accurately, although it requires careful calibration of the shift parameters for unbiased cosmological parameters. We demonstrate systematics control down to the $2\%$ level for both models, making them suitable for ongoing weak lensing surveys.
#### Macro-flickering of AQ Mensae on the daily time-scales: Parameters and  quasi-period modes

 - **Abstract**
 We analyzed TESS photometric data of the flickering-active cataclysmic star AQ Men in 2018--2019. We processed 7 sectors with 14 light curves (LCs) inside them, with a time resolution of 2 min. Aiming to study the "macro-flickering", with quasi periods (QPs) between 10 and 100 hours, we processed LCs after 55 time reduced, with a time resolution of 1.83 hours. The method, developed earlier by us, includes comparing the LCs by their statistical and fractal parameters, as well as revealing QPs by minima of structure functions and relevant maxima of autocorrelation functions. We distinguish the known high state of AQ Men, in the sectors ## 01, 05, 08, 12, 13, as well as the low state, in sectors #19, #20. In the low state the LCs show noticeable eclipses with period 3.4 h, lower average fluxes, higher scatters, and additional QPs. By its statistical and fractal parameters, the macro-flickering of AQ Men in the high state is similar to the ordinary flickering of 3 symbiotic binaries, studied by us earlier (see below). We found 92 QPs in the range of 20--70 h. We reveal 3 QP modes, at 20.9 h, 32.5 h and 54.1 h (1.149, 0.738 and 0.434 c/d; Fig. 7) within a standard error about 10%. The last mode is the most populated one and seems to be a manifestation of the superorbital period. Other 4 QP modes of AQ Men are added from the literature. The regularity of these 7 QP modes follows a power function with a base 1.57 and standard deviation 6.4% (Fig. 8). This power model prognosticates 5 other QP modes: 3 internal and 2 external (Table 2). The bases of the power regularity models for the flickering of the symbiotic binaries RS Oph, T CrB, and MWC 560 (however in the time scale of minutes) are 1.55, 2.0, and 1.34, respectively (Table 1). For unknown reasons in these 4 cases we find (i) regularities with (ii) different bases.

 We present a study of the impact of an uncertainty in the beam far side-lobe knowledge on the measurement of the Cosmic Microwave Background $B$-mode signal at large scale. It is expected to be one of the main source of systematic effects in future CMB observations. Because it is crucial for all-sky survey missions to take into account the interplays between beam systematic effects and all the data analysis steps, the primary goal of this paper is to provide the methodology to carry out the end-to-end study of their effect for a space-borne CMB polarization experiment, up to the cosmological results in the form of a bias $\delta r$ on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. LiteBIRD is dedicated to target the measurement of CMB primordial $B$ modes by reaching a sensitivity of $\sigma \left( r \right) \leq 10^{-3}$ assuming $r=0$. As a demonstration of our framework, we derive the relationship between the knowledge of the beam far side-lobes and the tentatively allocated error budget under given assumptions on design, simulation and component separation method. We assume no mitigation of the far side-lobes effect at any stage of the analysis pipeline. We show that $\delta r$ is mostly due to the integrated fractional power difference between the estimated beams and the true beams in the far side-lobes region, with little dependence on the actual shape of the beams, for low enough $\delta r$. Under our set of assumptions, in particular considering the specific foreground cleaning method we used, we find that the integrated fractional power in the far side-lobes should be known at a level as tight as $\sim 10^{-4}$, to achieve the required limit on the bias $\delta r < 1.9 \times 10^{-5}$. The framework and tools developed for this study can be easily adapted to provide requirements under different design, data analysis frameworks and for other future space-borne experiments beyond LiteBIRD.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the co-evolution of complex life with Earth's geology is an enduring challenge. The rock record evidences remarkable correlations between changes in biology and the wider Earth system, yet cause and effect remain unclear. Here, we link the evolutionary history of eukaryotes with the rise and fall of carbonate rock fraction within continental crust - a key variable in controlling the efficiency of carbon drawdown during weathering, solid Earth degassing rates, and ultimately nutrient supply to life. We use geospatial database analyses to demonstrate a strongly non-linear growth and then collapse in Earth's continental crust carbonate reservoir. Biomineralisers reshaped Earth's surface in their image; armouring continental margins with carbonate platforms, such that the continental carbonate reservoir increased in size by 5-fold in under 100 Myr after the Cambrian Radiation of animal life. This Paleozoic carbonate revolution represents among the most dramatic crustal evolutionary events in Earth's history. The Permo-Triassic extinction event coupled to the rise of open ocean calcifiers initiated a steady decline in continental crustal carbonate content; one that still continues today, which unabated would produce Precambrian-style crustal carbonate distributions in around 500-1000 Myr. Our results demonstrate strongly non-linear crustal evolution after the rise of the complex Phanerozoic biosphere. This outcome suggests that complex life may generate unique biogeochemical trajectories on otherwise geologically similar worlds, posing a new challenge in the hunt for life beyond Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological gravitational particle production (CGPP) is the creation of particles in an expanding universe due solely to their gravitational interaction. These particles can play an important role in the cosmic history through their connection to various cosmological relics including dark matter, gravitational wave radiation, dark radiation, and the baryon asymmetry. This review explains the phenomenon of CGPP as a consequence of quantum fields in a time-dependent background, catalogs known results for the spectra and cosmological abundance of gravitationally produced particles of various spins, and explores the phenomenological consequences and observational signatures of CGPP.

 - **Abstract**
 This chapter investigates the complexities surrounding the iron biogeochemical cycle from the Archean to present, with a focus on assessing the balance between iron sources and sinks during long periods of Earth's history with relatively invariable redox conditions, when steady state can be safely assumed. Currently, the residence time of iron in the ocean may be as short as approximately 5 years. The input flux of iron is highly sensitive to redox cycling in sediments, while its removal primarily occurs through dispersed processes of oxidation and precipitation. In the Archean, we find a significant imbalance between continental and hydrothermal inputs, which collectively contribute between 61,500 to 263,000 Gg/yr of dissolved iron to the oceans, and the most obvious sinks such as iron formations (IFs), which sequester up to ~43,000 Gg/yr of iron. A possible solution to this imbalance involves the dispersed abiotic precipitation and removal of iron as silicates, sulfides, and carbonates in marine basins. Additionally, we calculate the residence time of dissolved iron in the Archean oceans to be between 6 kyr and 3 Myr, which is significantly longer than the ocean mixing timescale. Our estimates indicate that under the anoxic Archean atmosphere, the iron cycle was more protracted than today, and the isotopic compositions and concentrations of dissolved iron were likely more uniform. Distinct water bodies were likely confined to limited areas or specific, dynamic systems with intense iron turnover, such as regions where deep-sea upwelling currents brought hydrothermal iron to photic zones rich in biotic or abiotic oxidants.

 - **Abstract**
 In some quantum gravity (QG) theories, Lorentz symmetry may be broken above the Planck scale. The Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) may induce observable effects at low energies and be detected at high energy astrophysical measurements. The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory(LHAASO) has detected the onset, rise, and decay phases of the afterglow of GRB 221009A, covering a wide energy range of photons approximately from $0.2$ to $18$ TeV. This observation provides an excellent opportunity to study the Lorentz invariance violation effect. In this study, we simultaneously utilize the data from the KM2A and WCDA detectors of LHAASO, and apply two event by event methods, namely the pair view method and maximum likelihood method, to investigate LIV. We obtain stringent constraints on the QG energy scale. For instance, through the maximum likelihood method, we determine the 95$\%$ confidence level lower limits to be $E_{QG,1} > 14.7 (6.5)\times 10^{19}$GeV for the subluminal (superluminal) scenario of $n = 1$, and $E_{QG,2} > 12.0 (7.2)\times 10^{11}$GeV for the subluminal (superluminal) scenario of $n = 2$. We find that the rapid rise and slow decay behaviors of the afterglow can impose strong constraints on the subluminal scenario, while the constraints are weaker for the superluminal scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results of explicit asymptotic approximations applied to neutrino--electron scattering in a representative model of neutrino population evolution under conditions characteristic of core-collapse supernova explosions or binary neutron star mergers. It is shown that this approach provides stable solutions of these stiff systems of equations, with accuracy and timestepping comparable to that for standard implicit treatments such as backward Euler, fixed point iteration, and Anderson-accelerated fixed point iteration. Because each timestep can be computed more rapidly with the explicit asymptotic approximation than with implicit methods, this suggests that algebraically stabilized explicit integration methods could be used to compute neutrino evolution coupled to hydrodynamics more efficiently in stellar explosions and mergers than the methods currently in use.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern astronomical surveys have multiple competing scientific goals. Optimizing the observation schedule for these goals presents significant computational and theoretical challenges, and state-of-the-art methods rely on expensive human inspection of simulated telescope schedules. Automated methods, such as reinforcement learning, have recently been explored to accelerate scheduling. However, there do not yet exist benchmark data sets or user-friendly software frameworks for testing and comparing these methods. We present DeepSurveySim -- a high-fidelity and flexible simulation tool for use in telescope scheduling. DeepSurveySim provides methods for tracking and approximating sky conditions for a set of observations from a user-supplied telescope configuration. We envision this tool being used to produce benchmark data sets and for evaluating the efficacy of ground-based telescope scheduling algorithms, particularly for machine learning algorithms that would suffer in efficacy if limited to real data for training.We introduce three example survey configurations and related code implementations as benchmark problems that can be simulated with DeepSurveySim.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-spectral resolution M-band spectra from iSHELL on NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) along the line of sight to the debris disk host star HD 32297. We also present a Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) H-band polarimetric image of the HD 131488 debris disk. We search for fundamental CO absorption lines in the iSHELL spectra of HD 32297 but do not detect any. We place an upper limit on the CO column density of $\sim$6$\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$. By combining the column density upper limit, the CO mass measured with ALMA, and the geometrical properties of the disk, we estimate the scale height of the CO to be $\lesssim$ 2 au across the radial extent of the disk ($\sim$80-120 au). We use the same method to estimate the CO scale height of three other edge-on, CO-rich debris disks that all have CO observed in absorption with HST as well as in emission with ALMA: $\beta$ Pictoris, HD 110058, and HD 131488. We compare our estimated CO scale heights of these four systems to the millimeter dust scale heights and find that, under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, there is a potential correlation between the CO and millimeter dust scale heights. There are multiple factors that affect the gas vertical structure such as turbulence, photodissociation with weak vertical mixing, as well as where the gas originates. One possible explanation for the potential correlation could be that the gas and dust are of a similar secondary origin in these four systems.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most exciting targets of current and future gravitational-wave observations is the angular power spectrum of the astrophysical GW background. This cumulative signal encodes information about the large-scale structure of the Universe, as well as the formation and evolution of compact binaries throughout cosmic time. However, the finite rate of compact binary mergers gives rise to temporal shot noise, which introduces a significant bias in measurements of the angular power spectrum if not explicitly accounted for. Previous work showed that this bias can be removed by cross-correlating GW sky maps constructed from different observing times. However, this work considered an idealised measurement scenario, ignoring detector specifics and in particular noise contributions. Here we extend this temporal cross-correlation method to account for these difficulties, allowing us to implement the first unbiased anisotropic search pipeline for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data. In doing so, we show that the existing pipeline is biased even in the absence of shot noise, due to previously neglected sub-leading contributions to the noise covariance. We apply our pipeline to mock LIGO data, and find that our improved analysis will be crucial for stochastic searches from the current observing run (O4) onwards.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia mission is delivering a large number of astrometric orbits for binary stars. By combining these with spectroscopic orbits for systems with two observable spectra (SB2), it is possible to derive the masses of both components. However, to get masses with a good accuracy requires accurate spectroscopic orbits, which is the major aim of the present paper. A subsidiary aim is to discover SB2 systems hiding among known SB1, and even though this search may often prove unsuccessful, the acquired radial velocities may be used anyway to improve the existing spectroscopic orbits. New radial velocities for 58 binary systems from the Ninth Catalogue of Spectroscopic Binary Orbits (SB9), obtained using the high-resolution HERMES spectrograph installed on the 1.2 m Mercator telescope, were used to possibly identify hitherto undetected SB2 systems. For SB1 systems with inaccurate orbits, these new radial-velocity measurements were used to improve the orbital accuracy. This paper provides 51 orbits (41 SB1 and 10 SB2) that have been improved with respect to the solution listed in the SB9 catalogue, out of the 58 SB9 orbits studied, which belong to 56 stellar systems. Among them, there are five triple and four quadruple systems. Despite the high resolution of HERMES, HIP 115142 A is the only system which we detected as a new SB2 system. The B component of the visual binary HIP 92726 has now been found to be a spectroscopic system as well, which makes HIP 92726 a newly discovered quadruple system (SB1+SB1). The high HERMES resolution allowed us moreover to better isolate the signature of the secondary component of HIP 12390, HIP 73182 and HIP 111170. More accurate masses have thus been derived for them. Among the 30 SB also present in Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) and with periods shorter than the Gaia DR3 time span (1000 d), only 5 were flagged as binaries by DR3.

 - **Abstract**
 In the hunt for Earth-like exoplanets it is crucial to have reliable host star parameters, as they have a direct impact on the accuracy and precision of the inferred parameters for any discovered exoplanet. For stars with masses between 0.35 and 0.5 ${\rm M_{\odot}}$ an unexplained radius inflation is observed relative to typical stellar models. However, for fully convective objects with a mass below 0.35 ${\rm M_{\odot}}$ it is not known whether this radius inflation is present as there are fewer objects with accurate measurements in this regime. Low-mass eclipsing binaries present a unique opportunity to determine empirical masses and radii for these low-mass stars. Here we report on such a star, EBLM J2114-39\,B. We have used HARPS and FEROS radial-velocities and TESS photometry to perform a joint fit of the data, and produce one of the most precise estimates of a very low mass star's parameters. Using a precise and accurate radius for the primary star using Gaia DR3 data, we determine J2114-39 to be a $M_1 = 0.987 \pm 0.059$ ${\rm M_{\odot}}$ primary star hosting a fully convective secondary with mass $M_2~=~0.0986~\pm 0.0038~\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, which lies in a poorly populated region of parameter space. With a radius $R_2 =~0.1275~\pm0.0020~\,\mathrm{R_{\odot}}$, similar to TRAPPIST-1, we see no significant evidence of radius inflation in this system when compared to stellar evolution models. We speculate that stellar models in the regime where radius inflation is observed might be affected by how convective overshooting is treated.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first Swift/XRT long-term monitoring of 2S 0114+650, a wind-fed supergiant X-ray binary for which both orbital and superorbital periods are known (P_orb~11.6d and P_sup~0.8d). Our campaign, summing up to ~ 79ks, is the most intense and complete sampling of the X-ray light curve of this source with a sensitive pointed X-ray instrument, and covers 17 orbital, and 6 superorbital cycles. The combination of flexibility, sensitivity, and soft X-ray coverage of XRT allowed us to confirm previously reported spectral changes along the orbital cycle of the source and unveil the variability in its spectral parameters as a function of the superorbital phase. For completeness, we also report on a similar analysis carried out by exploiting XRT archival data on three additional wind-fed supergiant X-ray binaries IGR J16418-4532, IGR J16479-4514, and IGR J16493-4348. For these sources, the archival data provided coverage along several superorbital cycles but our analysis could not reveal any significant spectral variability.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of 6266 solar flares detected by the X-Ray Solar Monitor onboard the Chandrayaan-2 lunar orbiter between 1.55 and 12.4 keV (1 and 8 \AA) from 2019 September 12 to 2022 November 4, including 1469 type A flares. The catalog represents the first large sample, including both type A, hot thermal flares, and type B, impulsive flares, with a sub-A class sensitive instrument. We also detect 213 sub-A and 1330 A class flares. Individual flares are fit with an exponentially-modified Gaussian function and multi-flare groups are decomposed into individual flares. We validate our findings with flare catalogs made using visual inspection as well as automatic pipelines on Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite and Solar Dynamics Observatory data. We find a clear bimodality in the ratio of the width to decay time between type A and B flares. We infer a power-law index of $\alpha_F = 1.92 \pm 0.09$ for the background-subtracted peak flux distribution of XSM flares, which is consistent with the value $\sim 2$ reported in the literature. We also infer $\alpha_F = 1.90 \pm 0.09$ for type B, and $\alpha_F = 1.94 \pm 0.08$ for type A flares, which has previously not been reported in the literature. These comparable values hint at a similarity in their generative processes.
#### Slant, Fan, and Narrow: the Response of Stellar Streams to a Tilting  Galactic Disk

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar streams are sensitive tracers of the gravitational potential, which is typically assumed to be static in the inner Galaxy. However, massive mergers like Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus can impart torques on the stellar disk of the Milky Way that result in the disk tilting at rates of up to 10-20 deg/Gyr. Here, we demonstrate the effects of disk tilting on the morphology and kinematics of stellar streams. Through a series of numerical experiments, we find that streams with nearby apocenters $(r_{\rm apo} \lesssim 20~\rm{kpc})$ are sensitive to disk tilting, with the primary effect being changes to the stream's on-sky track and width. Interestingly, disk tilting can produce both more diffuse streams and more narrow streams, depending on the orbital inclination of the progenitor and the direction in which the disk is tilting. Our model of Pal 5's tidal tails for a tilting rate of 15 deg/Gyr is in excellent agreement with the observed stream's track and width, and reproduces the extreme narrowing of the trailing tail. We also find that failure to account for a tilting disk can bias constraints on shape parameters of the Milky Way's local dark matter distribution at the level of 5-10%, with the direction of the bias changing for different streams. Disk tilting could therefore explain discrepancies in the Milky Way's dark matter halo shape inferred using different streams.
