 - **Abstract**
 Gas cooling and heating functions play a crucial role in galaxy formation. But, it is computationally expensive to exactly compute these functions in the presence of an incident radiation field. These computations can be greatly sped up by using interpolation tables of pre-computed values, at the expense of making significant and sometimes even unjustified approximations. Here we explore the capacity of machine learning to approximate cooling and heating functions with a generalized radiation field. Specifically, we use the machine learning algorithm XGBoost to predict cooling and heating functions calculated with the photoionization code Cloudy at fixed metallicity, using different combinations of photoionization rates as features. We perform a constrained quadratic fit in metallicity to enable a fair comparison with traditional interpolation methods at arbitrary metallicity. We consider the relative importance of various photoionization rates through both a principal component analysis (PCA) and calculation of SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values for our XGBoost models. We use feature importance information to select different subsets of rates to use in model training. Our XGBoost models outperform a traditional interpolation approach at each fixed metallicity, regardless of feature selection. At arbitrary metallicity, we are able to reduce the frequency of the largest cooling and heating function errors compared to an interpolation table. We find that the primary bottleneck to increasing accuracy lies in accurately capturing the metallicity dependence. This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning methods such as XGBoost to capture the non-linear behavior of cooling and heating functions.

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents the Globular cluster Extra-tidal Mock Star (GEMS) catalogue of extra-tidal stars and binaries created via three-body dynamical encounters in globular cluster cores. Using the particle-spray code Corespray, we sample N=50,000 extra-tidal stars and escaped recoil binaries for 159 Galactic globular clusters. Sky positions, kinematics, stellar properties and escape information are provided for all simulated stars. Stellar orbits are integrated in seven different static and time-varying Milky Way gravitational potential models where the structure of the disc, perturbations from the Large Magellanic Cloud and the mass and sphericity of the Milky Way's dark matter halo are all investigated. We find that the action coordinates of the mock extra-tidal stars are largely Galactic model independent, where minor offsets and broadening of the distributions between models are likely due to interactions with substructure. Importantly, we also report the first evidence for stellar stream contamination by globular cluster core stars and binaries for clusters with pericentre radii larger than five kiloparsecs. Finally, we provide a quantitative tool that uses action coordinates to match field stars to host clusters with probabilities. Ultimately, combining data from the GEMS catalogue with information of observed stars will allow for association of extra-tidal field stars with any Galactic globular cluster; a requisite tool for understanding population-level dynamics and evolution of clusters in the Milky Way.
#### The PEPSI Exoplanet Transit Survey (PETS) IV: Assessing the atmospheric  chemistry of KELT-20b

 - **Abstract**
 Most ultra hot Jupiters (UHJs) show evidence of temperature inversions, in which temperature increases with altitude over a range of pressures. Temperature inversions can occur when there is a species that absorbs the stellar irradiation at a relatively high level of the atmospheres. However, the species responsible for this absorption remains unidentified. In particular, the UHJ KELT-20b is known to have a temperature inversion. Using high resolution emission spectroscopy from LBT/PEPSI we investigate the atomic and molecular opacity sources that may cause the inversion in KELT-20b, as well as explore its atmospheric chemistry. We confirm the presence of Fe I with a significance of 17$\sigma$. We also report a tentative $4.3\sigma$ detection of Ni I. A nominally $4.5\sigma$ detection of Mg I emission in the PEPSI blue arm is likely in fact due to aliasing between the Mg I cross-correlation template and the Fe I lines present in the spectrum. We cannot reproduce a recent detection of Cr I, while we do not have the wavelength coverage to robustly test past detections of Fe II and Si I. Together with non-detections of molecular species like TiO, this suggests that Fe I is likely to be the dominant optical opacity source in the dayside atmosphere of KELT-20b and may be responsible for the temperature inversion. We explore ways to reconcile the differences between our results and those in literature and point to future paths to understand atmospheric variability.
#### The first white dwarf debris disk observed by JWST

 - **Abstract**
 This letter reports the first JWST spectroscopy of a white dwarf debris disk, giving a preliminary assessment of the salient features, and recommendations for future observations. The polluted and dusty star WD 0145+234 experienced a major collisional event in 2018, accompanied by an infrared outburst, and subsequently a gradual decrease in thermal emission. Time-series NIRSPEC observations demonstrate that the circumstellar disk is returning to a quiescent state with a T~1000 K infrared excess similar to the bulk of known dusty white dwarfs. MIRI spectroscopy reveals a 9-12 micron solid-state emission feature consistent with silicate minerals as observed in debris disks observed with Spitzer IRS. The strength and morphology of the silicate feature appear unchanged relative to the continuum in spectra taken over a year apart, consistent with steady-state collisional evolution of the circumstellar debris. A tentative emission feature around 7 microns may be due to carbonates, and if confirmed would indicate aqueous alteration in the parent body.
#### Simultaneous Estimates of Star-cluster Age, Metallicity, Mass, and  Extinction (SESAMME) I: Presenting an MCMC Approach to Spectral Stellar  Population Fitting

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first version release of SESAMME, a public, Python-based full spectrum fitting tool for Simultaneous Estimates of Star-cluster Age, Metallicity, Mass, and Extinction. SESAMME compares an input spectrum of a star cluster to a grid of stellar population models with an added nebular continuum component, using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to sample the posterior probability distribution in four dimensions: cluster age, stellar metallicity $Z$, reddening $E(B-V)$, and a normalization parameter equivalent to a cluster mass. SESAMME is highly flexible in the stellar population models that it can use to model a spectrum; our testing and initial science applications use both BPASS and Starburst99. We illustrate the ability of SESAMME to recover accurate ages and metallicities even at a moderate signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ~3 - 5 per wavelength bin) using synthetic, noise-added model spectra of young star clusters. Finally, we test the consistency of SESAMME with other age and metallicity estimates from the literature using a sample of HST/COS far-UV spectra towards young, massive clusters in M83 and NGC 1313. We find that, on the whole, SESAMME infers star cluster properties that are consistent with the literature in both low- and high-metallicity environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way's (MW) inner stellar halo contains an [Fe/H]-rich component with highly eccentric orbits, often referred to as the "last major merger." Hypotheses for the origin of this component include Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE), where the progenitor collided with the MW proto-disk 8-11 Gyr ago, and the Virgo Radial Merger (VRM), where the progenitor collided with the MW disk within the last 3 Gyr. These two scenarios make different predictions about observable structure in local phase space, because the morphology of debris depends on how long it has had to phase mix. The recently-identified phase-space folds in Gaia DR3 have positive caustic velocities, making them fundamentally different than the phase-mixed chevrons found in simulations at late times. Roughly 20% of the stars in the prograde local stellar halo are associated with the observed caustics. We compare the observed phase-space distribution to a time-series of FIRE-2 Latte simulations of a GSE-like merger, using a quantitative metric (2D causticality) that measures how phase-mixed a given distribution is. We find that the observed local phase-space distribution best matches the simulated data within 1 Gyr after the merger collides with the host galaxy disk, and certainly not later than 3 Gyr after collision. This is further evidence that the progenitor of the "last major merger" did not collide with the MW proto-disk at early times, as is thought for the GSE, but instead collided with the MW disk within the last few Gyr, consistent with the body of work surrounding the VRM.
#### The H-alpha Emission Signature: The Role of Critical Ionization Velocity  in Interstellar Space

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09389
 - **Abstract**
 Gaussian decomposition of HI4PI profiles was done for two regions along high velocity Complex M, the first with corresponding H-alpha emission and the second without. In the former, we detected the Critical Ionization Velocity (CIV) signature, a line width of 25 km/s, of H-alpha. In low-velocity gas, the CIV effect ionizes the atoms and produces the signatures of He (34 km/s), CNO (13.4 km/s), and the metals (around 6 km/s). In anomalous-velocity gas, the CIV effect ionizes the ions and produces the signatures of ionized CNO (20 km/s) and-or H-alpha (25.5 km/s), as well as the CIV signatures of metals around 6 km/s. These distinct CIV signatures indicate that the physical conditions are different in each velocity regime. The particles in the low-velocity gas cloud are initially neutral, the temperatures can be cold (50-100 K), and the abundances can be cosmic. The densities need to be high enough to impose regular recombination. The anomalous-velocity gas, on the other hand, initially contains a significant population of ionized and excited particles. The temperature and abundance values may be similar to those that characterize low-density gas, but the densities must be low enough so that the plasma is essentially collision-less, similar to the conditions in the solar wind.
#### Interstellar Meteors from Tidal Disruption of Rocky Planets on Eccentric  Orbits Around M Dwarfs

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09399
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09399
 - **Abstract**
 We show that the inferred properties of the meteor CNEOS-2014-01-08 (IM1) can be naturally explained by tidal disruption of rocky planets on highly eccentric orbits around the most common stars, M-dwarfs. Rocky planets can develop a high orbital eccentricity as a result of a secular torque from an outer giant planet or a binary companion. Melting of their rocky crust during many tight periapse passages may result in additional elemental differentiation, leading to enhanced abundances of beryllium, lanthanum and uranium in the crust, as inferred from the composition of unique spherules along IM1's path. The excess energy imparted to the tidal stream in highly eccentric orbits naturally accounts for the inferred IM1 speed of $\sim 60~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$ relative to the Local Standard of Rest. Finally, the tidal disruption of $\sim 10M_\oplus$ reservoirs of rocky material around M-dwarfs accounts for an impact rate of 500kg meteors on Earth of once per decade, consistent with IM1.
#### Identification and chemical modelling of phosphorus nitride (PN) towards  the hot molecular cores G10.47+0.03 and G31.41+0.31

 - **Abstract**
 Phosphorus (P) is one of the important elements for the formation of life and plays a crucial role in several biochemical processes. Recent spectral line surveys have confirmed the existence of P-bearing molecules, especially PN and PO, in the star-formation regions, but their formation mechanisms are poorly understood. The P-bearing molecule phosphorus nitride (PN) is detected in several star-forming regions, but this molecule has been poorly studied at high gas densities ($\geq$10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$) hot molecular cores. In this article, we present the detection of the rotational emission line of PN with transition J = 3$-$2 towards the hot molecular cores G10.47+0.03 and G31.41+0.31, using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA). The estimated column densities of PN for G10.47+0.03 and G31.41+0.31 using the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model are (3.60$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ and (9.10$\pm$0.1)$\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ with an excitation temperature of 150$\pm$25 K. The fractional abundance of PN relative to H$_{2}$ is 2.76$\times$10$^{-10}$ for G10.47+0.03 and 5.68$\times$10$^{-11}$ for G31.41+0.031. We compute the two-phase warm-up chemical model of PN to understand the chemical evolution in the environment of hot molecular cores. After chemical modelling, we claim that PN is created in the gas phase via the neutral-neutral reaction between PO and N in the warm-up stage. Similarly, PN is destroyed via the ion-neutral reaction between H$_{3}$O$^{+}$ and PN.

 - **Abstract**
 This work shows that a class of astrodynamics problems subject to mission constraints can be efficiently solved using the Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) mathematical framework by a specific change of coordinates. In these problems, the constraints are initially written in non-linear and coupled mathematical forms using classical rectangular coordinates. The symmetries of the constrained problem are used to select a new system of coordinates that transforms the non-linear constraints into linear. This change of coordinates is also used to isolate the components of the constraints. This way the TFC technique can be used to solve the ordinary differential equations governing orbit transfer problems subject to mission constraints. Specifically, this paper shows how to apply the change of coordinates method to the perturbed Hohmann-type and the one-tangent burn transfer problems.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we employ a convolutional neural network to classify gravitational waves originating from core-collapse supernovae. Training was conducted using spectrograms derived from three-dimensional numerical simulations of waveforms, which were injected onto real noise data from the third observing run of both Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. To gain insights into the model's decision-making process, we apply class activation mapping techniques to visualize the regions in the input image that are significant for the model's prediction. Our model distinguished between 9 different waveforms and noise with an accuracy of 98.4% at 1 kpc. Visualization through class activation mapping revealed that the model's predictions predominantly rely on specific features within the input spectrograms, namely the g-mode and low-frequency modes.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric turbulence profile plays an important role in designing and operating adaptive optics (AO) systems with multiple laser guide stars. To obtain representative free atmospheric profiles and resolved ground layer profiles for future AO systems at the Subaru telescope, we are conducting the SHARPEST (Shack-Hartmann Atmospheric tuRbulence Profiling Experiment at the Subaru Telescope) project. In this project, we develop a turbulence profiler comprising two Shack-Hartmann (SH) sensors to observe a pair of bright stars through the Subaru telescope with high spatial sampling by 2 cm subapertures. We perform two analyses on the SH spot data: variance analysis on the spot scintillation for free atmospheric profiles, and on the spot slope for ground layer profiles. This paper introduces the initial results of free atmospheric profiles as well as total seeing values and wind profiles obtained by the first two engineering runs. The free atmospheric profiles reconstructed by the two independent SH sensors show good agreement. The results are also consistent with simultaneous measurements by another profiler except for turbulence strength at ~1 km, which is explained by an overestimation problem of scintillation-based profilers. Measured total seeing values are also smaller than the simultaneous measurements, possibly due to the difference in ground layer turbulence between the two sites. The wind profiles show good consistency with the direct measurements by a rawinsonde. Through this study, we establish a method to constrain the free atmospheric profile, the total seeing, and the wind profile by analysing data from a single SH sensor with fine subapertures.
#### Wind erosion and transport on planetesimals

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09572
 - **Abstract**
 We consider the possibility that aeolian (wind blown) processes occur on small, 10 to 100~km diameter, planetesimals when they were embedded in the protosolar nebula. Drag from a headwind within a protostellar disk is sufficiently large to loft cm and smaller sized particles off the surface of a 10 km diameter asteroid in the inner solar system (at a few AU), and micron sized particles off the surface of a 10 km diameter object in the Transneptunian region. The headwind is sufficiently strong to overcome surface cohesion in the inner solar system, but not in the outer solar system. However, in the outer solar system, surface particles can be redistributed or escape due to impacts from particles that are in the protosolar disk's wind. Based on scaling crater ejecta, we estimate that impacts from particles in the headwind will lead to erosion of mass rather than accretion for planetesimals below about 10 km in diameter. The erosion limit is independent of material strength but proportional to the wind velocity. We explore the sensitivity of splash particle trajectories to particle size, headwind velocity and Reynolds number. Winds from a protostellar disk could account for Kuiper Belt Object (486958) Arrokoth's smooth undulating terrain but only during an epoch of high particle flux and low wind velocity. These conditions could have been present during and just after coalescence of Arrokoth's building blocks.
#### ALMA High-frequency Long-baseline Campaign in 2021: Highest Angular  Resolution Submillimeter Wave Images for the Carbon-rich Star R Lep
 - **Authors:** Yoshiharu Asaki, Luke T. Maud, Harold Francke, Hiroshi Nagai, Dirk Petry, Edward B. Fomalont, Elizabeth Humphreys, Anita M.S. Richards, Ka Tat Wong, William Dent, Akihiko Hirota, Jose Miguel Fernandez, Satoko Takahashi, Antonio S. Hales

 - **Abstract**
 The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) was used in 2021 to image the carbon-rich evolved star R Lep in Bands 8-10 (397-908 GHz) with baselines up to 16 km. The goal was to validate the calibration, using band-to-band (B2B) phase referencing with a close phase calibrator J0504-1512, 1.2 deg from R Lep in this case, and the imaging procedures required to obtain the maximum angular resolution achievable with ALMA. Images of the continuum emission and the HCN maser line at 890.8 GHz, from the J=10-9 transition between the (1110) and (0400) vibrationally excited states, achieved angular resolutions of 13, 6, and 5 mas in Bands 8-10, respectively. Self-calibration (self-cal) was used to produce ideal images as to compare with the B2B phase referencing technique. The continuum emission was resolved in Bands 9 and 10, leaving too little flux for self-cal of the longest baselines, so these comparisons are made at coarser resolution. Comparisons showed that B2B phase referencing provided phase corrections sufficient to recover 92%, 83%, and 77% of the ideal image continuum flux densities. The HCN maser was sufficiently compact to obtain self-cal solutions in Band 10 for all baselines (up to 16 km). In Band 10, B2B phase referencing as compared to the ideal images recovered 61% and 70% of the flux density for the HCN maser and continuum, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Novae are luminous explosions in close binaries which host a white dwarf and a companion donor star. They are triggered by a thermonuclear runaway when the white dwarf accretes a critical amount of matter from the secondary. Though novae are established as high-energy gamma-ray emitters through observations by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), the origin of the gamma-ray emission, whether it is hadronic or leptonic, had been under intense debate until very recently. RS Ophiuchi (RS Oph) is a well-known recurrent symbiotic nova with a recurrence time scale of 15 years. The most recent outburst of RS Oph in 2021 brought the first detection of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays from a nova ever. The first Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array observed this historic event along with H.E.S.S. and MAGIC. The LST-1 observations in the first days after the burst onset show a clear VHE gamma-ray signal from RS Oph. The low energy threshold of LST-1 allows us to reconstruct the RS Oph gamma-ray spectrum down to $\sim$30 GeV, providing the best connection of the VHE gamma-ray data to the Fermi LAT energy range. The results from the analysis of the LST-1 observations are consistent with those obtained with H.E.S.S. and MAGIC, and also support a hadronic origin for the observed gamma-ray fluxes. In this contribution, we will present the analysis results of the LST-1 observations of the 2021 outburst of RS Oph.
#### A global view on star formation: The GLOSTAR Galactic plane survey. IX.  Radio Source Catalog III: 2<l<28, 36<l<40, 56<l<60 and |b|<1, VLA  B-configuration

 - **Abstract**
 As part of the GLOSTAR (GLObal view of STAR formation in the Milky Way) survey, we present the high-resolution continuum source catalog for the regions (l = 2-28, 36-40, 56-60, &|b|<1.0), observed with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in its B-configuration. The continuum images are optimized to detect compact sources on angular scales up to 4", and have a typical noise level of 1sigma ~ 0.08mJy/beam for an angular resolution of 1", which makes GLOSTAR currently the highest resolution as well as the most sensitive radio survey of the northern Galactic plane at 4-8GHz. We extracted 13354 sources above a threshold of 5sigma and 5437 sources above 7sigma that represent the high-reliability catalog. We determined the in-band spectral index (alpha) for the sources in the 7sigma-threshold catalog. The mean value is alpha=-0.6, which indicates that the catalog is dominated by sources emitting non-thermal radio emission. We identified the most common source types detected in radio surveys: 251 HII region candidates (113 new), 282 planetary nebulae (PNe) candidates (127 new), 784 radio star candidates (581 new), and 4080 extragalactic radio source candidates (2175 new). A significant fraction of HII regions and PNe candidates have alpha<-0.1 indicating that these candidates could contain radio jets, winds or outflows from high-mass and low-mass stellar objects. We identified 245 variable radio sources by comparing the flux densities of compact sources from the GLOSTAR survey and the Co-Ordinated Radio `N' Infrared Survey for High-mass star formation (CORNISH), and find that most of them are infrared quiet. The catalog is typically 95% complete for point sources at a flux density of 0.6 mJy (i.e. typical 7sigma level) and the systematic positional uncertainty is <= 0.1". The GLOSTAR data and catalogs are available online at https://glostar.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de.
#### Extensive air showers and atmospheric electric fields. Synergy of Space  and atmospheric particle accelerators

 - **Abstract**
 Various particle accelerators operate in the space plasmas, filling the Galaxy with high energy particles, primary cosmic rays. Reaching the atmosphere of the earth, these particles originate extensive air showers consisting of millions of elementary particles, secondary cosmic rays, covering several large areas on the ground. During thunderstorms, strong electric fields modulate the energy spectra of secondary particles and, consequently, originate short and long particle bursts. Impulse amplifications of particle fluxes, the thunderstorm ground enhancements, TGEs manifest themselves as peaks in the time series of count rates of particle detectors, which coincide with thunderstorms, during which free electrons are accelerating and multiplied, forming electron gamma ray avalanches. Thus, electron accelerators emerging in thunderous atmospheres can significantly alter the frequency of EAS triggers.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the momentum coupling between early dark energy (EDE) and cold dark matter to alleviate cosmological tensions. EDE has exhibited promising efficacy in addressing the Hubble tension, but it exacerbates the large-scale structure tension. We consider the interaction between EDE and cold dark matter, introducing a pure momentum exchange between them to alleviate the large-scale structure tension introduced by the EDE model. We find that this coupling model is consistent with the EDE model, yielding a higher value for $H_0$, which can resolve the Hubble tension. Additionally, the new model exhibits a suppressive effect on structure growth, contributing to the alleviation of the large-scale structure tension. By utilising the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method and incorporating various cosmological data, the coupling model constrains the best-fit values for $H_0$ to be $72.23$ km/s/Mpc and for $S_8$ to be 0.8192. Compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model, the new models have not fully resolved the large-scale structure tension. However, in contrast to the best-fit value of 0.8316 for $S_8$ obtained from the EDE model, the new model alleviates the negative impact of the EDE model.

 - **Abstract**
 TESS observations of pulsating hot main sequence stars paint a very different picture from what is currently accepted. There are large numbers of delta Scuti (DSCT) stars hotter than the theoretical hot edge of the instability strip, continuing to what appear to be DSCT stars of mid-B type (historically known as Maia variables). The frequencies of maximum amplitude in DSCT stars are in poor agreement with unstable frequencies from the models. There is a well-defined upper envelope in the frequencies of maximum amplitude as a function of effective temperature for DSCT and MAIA stars which requires an explanation. The gamma Doradus (GDOR) stars should be regarded as DSCT stars with suppressed high frequencies rather than a separate class. They are found mostly among the cool DSCT stars, but occur throughout the DSCT instability strip and as early A-type stars, where they merge with the SPB variables. The mixture of DSCT and GDOR stars throughout the instability strip is one example of the unexplained large variation of frequency patterns in DSCT stars. The location of beta Cephei stars in the H-R diagram agrees quite well with the models, but the observed frequencies are generally higher than predicted. There are no discernible boundaries between the traditional classes of pulsating stars. Existing pulsation models do not describe the observations at all well and a re-evaluation is required.

 After 28 years from the conception of the pyramid WFS several new kind of devices able to convert wavefront shape into some sort of different illumination on a detector have been conceived. While, suspending momentarily any kind of modesty, I claim credit for being among the few that contributed to show at the time that there could be much more than just a lenslet array I continued -- with alternating successes -- to conceive other types of such devices.

 - **Abstract**
 The JWST NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) presents a unique opportunity to observe directly imaged exoplanets from 3-5um at moderate spectral resolution (R~2,700) and thereby better constrain the composition, disequilibrium chemistry, and cloud properties of their atmospheres. In this work, we present the first NIRSpec IFU high-contrast observations of a substellar companion that requires starlight suppression techniques. We develop specific data reduction strategies to study faint companions around bright stars, and assess the performance of NIRSpec at high contrast. First, we demonstrate an approach to forward model the companion signal and the starlight directly in the detector images, which mitigates the effects of NIRSpec's spatial undersampling. We demonstrate a sensitivity to planets that are 2e-6 fainter than their stars at 1'', or 2e-5 at 0.3''. Then, we implement a reference star point spread function (PSF) subtraction and a spectral extraction that does not require spatially and spectrally regularly sampled spectral cubes. This allows us to extract a moderate resolution (R~2,700) spectrum of the faint T-dwarf companion HD~19467~B from 2.9-5.2um with signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)~10 per resolution element. Across this wavelength range, HD~19467~B has a flux ratio varying between 1e-5-1e-4 and a separation relative to its star of 1.6''. A companion paper by Hoch et al. more deeply analyzes the atmospheric properties of this companion based on the extracted spectrum. Using the methods developed here, NIRSpec's sensitivity may enable direct detection and spectral characterization of relatively old (~1Gyr), cool (~250K), and closely separated (~3-5au) exoplanets that are less massive than Jupiter.

 - **Abstract**
 We study mass ejection from a binary neutron star merger producing a long-lived massive neutron star remnant with general-relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics simulations. In addition to outflows generated by shocks and tidal torques during and shortly after the merger, we observe the appearance of a wind driven by spiral density waves in the disk. This spiral-wave-driven outflow is predominantly located close to the disk orbital plane and have a broad distribution of electron fractions. At higher latitudes, a high electron-fraction wind is driven by neutrino radiation. The combined nucleosynthesis yields from all the ejecta components is in good agreement with Solar abundance measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 CORSIKA 8 is a new framework for air shower simulations implemented in modern C++17, based on past experience with existing codes like CORSIKA 7. The flexible and modular structure of the project allows the development of independent modules that can produce a fully customizable air shower simulation. The radio module in particular is designed to treat the signal propagation and electric field calculation to each antenna in an autonomous and flexible way. It provides the possibility to simulate simultaneously the radio emission calculated with two independent time-domain formalisms, the "Endpoint formalism" as implemented in CoREAS and the "ZHS" algorithm as ported from ZHAireS. Future development for the simulation of radio emission from particle showers in complex scenarios, for example cross-media showers penetrating from air into ice, can build on the existing radio module, re-using the establishes interfaces. In this work, we will present the design and implementation of the radio module in CORSIKA 8, and show a direct comparison of radio emission from air showers simulated with CORSIKA 8, CORSIKA 7 and ZHAireS.
#### Late-time data require smaller sound horizon at recombination

 - **Abstract**
 The Hubble constant problem is that the values of Hubble constant from the observation of cosmic microwave background assuming the LambdaCDM model disagrees with the values from direct measurements. This problem suggests some new physics beyond the LambdaCDM model. Typically there are two ways of reconciliation: one is the realization of smaller value of sound horizon at recombination, and the other is the modification of the way of expansion of the universe after recombination. In this letter we examine the latter possibility by comparing two typical phenomenological dark energy models with the distance-redshift relation provided by Pantheon catalogue of supernova observations and galaxy surveys by BOSS and eBOSS collaborations. Though these phenomenological dark energy models globally fit observations better than the LambdaCDM model, they are strongly disfavored by the distance-redshift relation as almost the same level as the LambdaCDM model defined by cosmic microwave background observations. The distance-redshift relation strongly suggests some new physics which realize smaller value of sound horizon at recombination.

 - **Abstract**
 Aerocapture uses atmospheric drag to decelerate spacecraft and achieve orbit insertion. One of the significant risks associated with aerocapture is the uncertainty in the atmospheric density, particularly for outer planets. The paper performs a comparative study of the atmospheric uncertainties and provides design rules for aerocapture missions. The atmospheres of Venus, Mars, and Titan are well-characterized for engineering purposes. At the altitude ranges relevant for aerocapture, the 3$\sigma$ density variation is approximately $\pm$30%, $\pm$50%, $\pm$30% for Venus, Mars, and Titan respectively. With no in-situ data, the atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune are not as well characterized as the other bodies. For both Uranus and Neptune, the GRAM suite provides a 3$\sigma$ density variation of approximately $\pm$30% for the relevant altitude ranges which is considered an optimistic estimate. Until in-situ data from an atmospheric probe becomes available, a more conservative global min-max estimate is recommended to accommodate the worst-case scenario. The study presents a graphical method for selection of the optimal entry flight path angle when considering the atmospheric uncertainties to ensure the on-board guidance is given the best possible initial state for targeting the desired exit state post aerocapture.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of a $\gamma$-ray bubble spanning at least 100$\rm deg^2$ in ultra high energy (UHE) up to a few PeV in the direction of the star-forming region Cygnus X, implying the presence Super PeVatron(s) accelerating protons to at least 10 PeV. A log-parabola form with the photon index $\Gamma (E) = (2.71 \pm 0.02) + (0.11 \pm 0.02) \times \log_{10} (E/10 \ {\rm TeV})$ is found fitting the gamma-ray energy spectrum of the bubble well. UHE sources, `hot spots' correlated with very massive molecular clouds, and a quasi-spherical amorphous $\gamma$-ray emitter with a sharp central brightening are observed in the bubble. In the core of $\sim 0.5^{\circ}$, spatially associating with a region containing massive OB association (Cygnus OB2) and a microquasar (Cygnus X-3), as well as previously reported multi-TeV sources, an enhanced concentration of UHE $\gamma$-rays are observed with 2 photons at energies above 1 PeV. The general feature of the bubble, the morphology and the energy spectrum, are reasonably reproduced by the assumption of a particle accelerator in the core, continuously injecting protons into the ambient medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Binary Cepheids play an important role in investigating the calibration of the classical Cepheid period-luminosity relationship. Therefore a thorough study of individual Cepheids belonging to binary systems is necessary. Aims. Our aim is to determine the orbit of the binary system V1344 Aql using newly observed and earlier published spectroscopic and photometric data. Methods. We collected new radial velocity observations using medium resolution (${R \approx 11000}$ and ${R \lessapprox 20000}$) spectrographs and we updated the pulsation period of the Cepheid based on available photometric observations using $O-C$ diagram. Separating the pulsational and orbital radial velocity variations for each observational season (year), we determined the orbital solution for the system using $\chi^2$ minimisation. Results. The updated pulsation period of the Cepheid estimated for the epoch of HJD 2458955.83 is 7.476826 days. We determined orbital elements for the first time in the literature. The orbital period of the system is about 34.6 years, with an eccentricity e = 0.22.

 - **Abstract**
 The vertical phase-space spiral (snail) is a direct sign of dis-equilibrium of Milky Way's disc. Nevertheless, the wrapping of the phase snail contains information of the vertical potential. We propose a novel method to measure the vertical potential utilizing the intersections between the snail and $z$/$V_{z}$ axes, for which we know the maximum vertical heights ($Z_{max}$) or the maximum vertical velocities ($V_{z,max}$). Using a refined linear interpolation method, we directly obtain $(Z_{max},\ \frac{1}{2}V_{z,max}^{2})$ for these snail intersections to constrain the vertical potential profile empirically. Our method is model independent since no assumptions about the snail shape or the vertical potential have been made. Although the snail binned by the guiding center radius ($R_{g}$) is more prominent, it traces a vertical potential shallower than that of the snail binned by the same Galactocentric radius ($R$). We apply an empirical method to correct this difference. We measure the snail intersections in several $R_{g}$ bins within $7.5< R_{g} < 11.0$ kpc for Gaia DR3, and apply the interpolation method to deduce the potential values at several vertical heights. The potential at the snail intersections, as well as the following mass modeling are consistent with the popular Milky Way potentials in the literature. For the $R_{g}$-binned phase snail in the Solar neighborhood, the mass modeling indicates a local dark matter density of $\rho_{\rm dm}= 0.0150\pm0.0031$ $\rm M_{\odot}\,pc^{-3}$, consistent with previous works. Our method could be applied to larger radial ranges in future works, to provide independent and stronger constraints on the Milky Way's potential.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery, mass, and radius determination of TOI-1801 b, a temperate mini-Neptune around a young M dwarf. TOI-1801 b was observed in TESS sectors 22 and 49, and the alert that this was a TESS planet candidate with a period of 21.3 days went out in April 2020. However, ground-based follow-up observations, including seeing-limited photometry in and outside transit together with precise radial velocity (RV) measurements with CARMENES and HIRES revealed that the true period of the planet is 10.6 days. These observations also allowed us to retrieve a mass of 5.74 $\pm$ 1.46 $M_\oplus$, which together with a radius of 2.08 $\pm$ 0.12 $R_\oplus$, means that TOI-1801 b is most probably composed of water and rock, with an upper limit of 2\% by mass of H$_{2}$ in its atmosphere. The stellar rotation period of 16 days is readily detectable in our RV time series and in the ground-based photometry. We derived a likely age of 600--800 Myr for the parent star TOI-1801, which means that TOI-1801 b is the least massive young mini-Neptune with precise mass and radius determinations. Our results suggest that if TOI-1801 b had a larger atmosphere in the past, it must have been removed by some evolutionary mechanism on timescales shorter than 1 Gyr.

 - **Abstract**
 We use multiband archival HST observations to measure the photometric and structural parameters of the M81 globular cluster that hosts the Fast Radio Burst FRB 20200120E. Our best-fitting King model has an effective radius $r_h = 3.06$ pc with a moderate King model concentration of $c = 53$, and an inferred core radius of 0.81 pc. We revisit the exact astrometric location of the FRB within the cluster, and find that FRB 20200120E is located 1.92 pc from the center, but within the projected half-light radius. We estimate the relative encounter rate of the FRB host, along with the corresponding rates of 210 other globular clusters in M81, and compare these values with the encounter rates of Galactic globular clusters. The FRB resides in a globular cluster with an encounter rate that is moderately higher than the median stellar encounter rate in our two comparison samples. While the estimated encounter rate of the FRB host cluster (e.g., $\sim50\%$ of a cluster like 47 Tuc) is sufficient to allow the possibility that the FRB formed dynamically, our results do not place strong constraints on this scenario due to the limitations of the available HST data and the possible systematic uncertainties and selection effects in the comparison data.

 - **Abstract**
 HD 139139 (a.k.a. 'The random transiter') is a star that exhibited enigmatic transit-like features with no apparent periodicity in K2 data. The shallow depth of the events ($\sim$200 ppm -- equivalent to transiting objects with radii of $\sim$1.5 R$_\oplus$ in front of a Sun-like star), and their non-periodicity, constitutes a challenge for the photometric follow-up of this star. The goal of this study is to confirm with independent measurements the presence of shallow, non-periodic transit-like features on this object. We performed observations with the CHEOPS satellite, for a total accumulated time of 12.75 d, distributed in visits of roughly 20 h, in two observing campaigns, in years 2021 and 2022. The precision of the data is sufficient to detect 150 ppm features with durations longer than 1.5 h. We use the duration and times of the events seen in the K2 curve to estimate how many should have been detected in our campaigns, under the assumption that their behaviour during the CHEOPS observations is the same as in the K2 data of 2017. We do not detected events with depths larger than 150 ppm in our data set. If the frequency, depth, and duration of the events were the same as in the K2 campaign, we estimate the probability of having missed all events due to our limited observing window as 4.8 %. We suggest three different scenarios: 1) our observing window was not long enough, and the events were missed with the estimated 4.8 % probability, 2) the events recorded in K2 observations were time-critical, and the mechanism producing them was either not active in the two 2021 and 2022 campaigns, or producing shallower events under our detectability level, or 3) the enigmatic events in K2 data are the result of an unidentified and infrequent instrumental noise in the original data set or its data treatment.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the influence of the Milky Way galaxy's chemical evolution on the formation, structure, and habitability of the Solar system. Using a multi-zone Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) model, we successfully reproduce key observational constraints, including the age-metallicity ([Fe/H]) relation, metallicity distribution functions, abundance gradients, and [X/Fe] ratio trends for critical elements involved in planetary mineralogy, including C, O, Mg, and Si. Our GCE model suggests that the Sun formed in the inner Galactic disc, $R_{\rm birth,\odot}\approx 5$ kpc. We also combined a stoichiometric model with the GCE model to examine the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of planet building blocks (PBBs) within the Milky Way galaxy, revealing trends in the condensed mass fraction ($f_{\rm cond}$), iron-to-silicon mass fraction ($f_{\rm iron}$), and water mass fraction ($f_{\rm water}$) over time and towards the inner Galactic disc regions. Specifically, our model predicts a higher $f_{\rm cond}$ in the protoplanetary disc within the inner regions of the Milky Way galaxy, as well as an increased $f_{\rm iron}$ and a decreased $f_{\rm water}$ in the inner regions. Based on these findings, we discuss the potential impact of the Sun's birth location on the overall structure and habitability of the Solar System.

 - **Abstract**
 The X-ray source CXOU J163802.6-471358is thought to be a pulsar wind nebula (PWN), as it shows an extended, $\approx 40$ arcsec trail from a compact source. Here we present GMRT observations of this source at 330 and 1390 MHz, which reveal a remarkable linear radio trail $\approx 90$ arcsec in extent. Although the radio trail points back to the supernova remnant (SNR) G338.1+0.4, $\approx 50$ arcmin from ,CXOU J163802.6-471358 associating it with this remnant would require a very large velocity for the pulsar. There are no known galactic SNRs close to the PWN and radio trail. No pulsar has yet been identified in CXOU J163802.6-471358, but if one could be found, this would allow more quantitative studies of the PWN and radio trail to be made.

 - **Abstract**
 To understand the chemistry of sulphur (S) in the interstellar medium, models need to be tested by observations of S-bearing molecules in different physical conditions. We analyse observations obtained with the IRAM 30m telescope towards 15 well-known cores classified in the three main evolutionary stages of the high-mass star-formation process: high-mass starless cores,high-mass protostellar objects, and ultracompact HII regions. We detected rotational lines of SO, SO+, NS, C34S, 13CS, SO2, CCS, H2S, HCS+, OCS, H2CS, and CCCS. We also analyse for the first time lines of the NO molecule to complement the analysis. From a local thermodynamic equilibrium approach, we have derived column densities of each species and excitation temperatures. Based on a statistical analysis on the line widths and the excitation temperatures, we find that: NS, C34S, 13CS, CCS, and HCS+ trace cold, quiescent, and likely extended material; OCS, and SO2 trace warmer, more turbulent, and likely denser and more compact material; SO and perhaps SO+ trace both quiescent and turbulent material depending on the target. The abundances of SO, SO2, and H2S show the strongest positive correlations with the kinetic temperature, believed to be an evolutionary indicator. Moreover, the sum of all molecular abundances show an enhancement of gaseous S from the less evolved to the more evolved stages. These trends could be due to the increasing amount of S sputtered from dust grains owing to the increasing protostellar activity with evolution. The average abundances in each evolutionary group increase especially in the oxygen-bearing molecules, perhaps due to the increasing abundance of atomic oxygen with evolution owing to photodissociation of water in gas phase. Our observational work represents a test-bed for theoretical studies aimed at modelling the chemistry of sulphur during the evolution of high-mass star-forming cores

 - **Abstract**
 While looking for recently discovered distant Cepheids with an interesting chemical composition, we noticed one star (OGLE GD-CEP-1353) with extremely large equivalent widths of spectral lines of heavy elements. The aim of this work is to perform an abundance analysis, and to find a possible explanation for the found chemical anomaly. Quantitative analysis of the equivalent widths and synthetic spectrum synthesis were used to derive abundances in this star. Both local and nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE and NLTE) approximations were used in our analysis. Abundances of 28 chemical elements from carbon to thorium were derived. While light and iron peak elements show abundances typical for distant Cepheids (located in the outer disk), the s-process elements are overabundant about one dex. r-process elements are slightly less overabundant.

 - **Abstract**
 Continuing from our prior work (Alhassan et al. 2022), where a single detector data of the Einstein Telescope (ET) was evaluated for the detection of binary black hole (BBHs) using deep learning (DL). In this work we explored the detection efficiency of BBHs using data combined from all the three proposed detectors of ET, with five different lower frequency cutoff (Flow): 5 Hz, 10 Hz, 15 Hz, 20 Hz and 30 Hz, and the same previously used SNR ranges of: 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8 and >8. Using ResNet model (which had the best overall performance on single detector data), the detection accuracy has improved from 60%, 60.5%, 84.5%, 94.5% and 98.5% to 78.5%, 84%, 99.5%, 100% and 100% for sources with SNR of 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8 and >8 respectively. The results show a great improvement in accuracy for lower SNR ranges: 4-5, 5-6 and 6-7 by 18.5%, 24.5%, 13% respectively, and by 5.5% and 1.5% for higher SNR ranges: 7-8 and >8 respectively. In a qualitative evaluation, ResNet model was able to detect sources at 86.601 Gpc, with 3.9 averaged SNR (averaged SNR from the three detectors) and 13.632 chirp mass at 5 Hz. It was also shown that the use of the three detectors combined data is appropriate for near-real-time detection, and can be significantly improved using more powerful setup.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results obtained from the spectral studies of black hole X-ray binary GX~339--4 using \astrosat~ observations during its 2021 outburst. \astrosat~ observed the source in the intermediate state for $\sim600$ ks. The combined spectra of SXT and LAXPC in the $0.7-25$ keV energy range are studied with phenomenological and physical models. The spectral study reveals a receding disc and a contracting corona during the observation period. The outflow rate is found to be increased though the accretion rates did not vary during the observation period. The X-ray flux decreases as the disc recedes and the spectrum becomes hard. At the same time, the Comptonized flux decreases with increasing fraction of thermal emission. This could be plausible that episodic jet ejection modified the corona and reduced Comptonized flux. An iron emission line at 6.4 keV is observed in the spectra of all the orbits of observation. We find that the equivalent width of the iron emission line correlates with the photon index, indicating a decrease in the reflection strength as the spectrum becomes hard. We observe that the disc flux does not follow $F_{\rm DBB}-T^{4}$ relation.

 - **Abstract**
 The active asteroid 311P is one of the two targets of a planned Chinese asteroid exploration mission Tianwen-2. During 2013, 311P experienced several mass-loss events and exhibited multiple comet-like tails. Here we analyze the morphology and surface brightness of the tails to investigate the dust environment around the nucleus and mechanism of activities. We enhance the features of the tails using image processing techniques to obtain information about the morphology of the tails, and fit processed images to the syndyne-synchrone diagrams. The fitting results give estimations of the upper limits of the durations ($2\sim8$ days) of eruptions and the dust size range ($0.006\sim38.9$ mm) in the tails. The results of surface photometry performed for each dust tail show that the brightness distribution index of each tail ranged from approximately -1.81 to 0 and the dust size distribution indices of 311P's tails ranged from -2.29 to -1.45. The quantity of particles in each tail ranged from 0.5 to 8 $\times10^6$\,kg, which leads to a total dust-loss quantity of $3.0\times10^7$\,kg and a mass loss rate of 1.59 kg s$^{-1}$. Sublimation, continuous impacts or tidal forces of planets are excluded as explanations for 311P's activities, and rotational instability remains a possible activation cause without strong evidence against it.

 - **Abstract**
 The large side aperture of the NuSTAR telescope for unfocused photons (so-called stray light) is a known source of rich astrophysical information. To support many studies based on the NuSTAR stray light data, we present a fully automatic method for determining detector area suitable for background analysis and free from any kind of focused X-ray flux. The method's main idea is `a trous' wavelet image decomposition, capable of detecting structures of any spatial scale and shape, which makes the method of general use. Applied to the NuSTAR data, the method provides a detector image region with the highest possible statistical quality, suitable for the NuSTAR stray light studies. We developed an open-source Python nuwavdet package, which implements the presented method. The package contains subroutines to generate detector image region for further stray light analysis and/or to produce a list of detector bad-flagged pixels for processing in the NuSTAR Data Analysis Software for conventional X-ray analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe a machine-learning-based surrogate model for reproducing the Bayesian posterior distributions for exoplanet atmospheric parameters derived from transmission spectra of transiting planets with typical retrieval software such as TauRex. The model is trained on ground truth distributions for seven parameters: the planet radius, the atmospheric temperature, and the mixing ratios for five common absorbers: $H_2O$, $CH_4$, $NH_3$, $CO$ and $CO_2$. The model performance is enhanced by domain-inspired preprocessing of the features and the use of semi-supervised learning in order to leverage the large amount of unlabelled training data available. The model was among the winning solutions in the 2023 Ariel Machine Learning Data Challenge.

 - **Abstract**
 The early afterglow of a Gamma-ray burst (GRB) can provide critical information on the jet and progenitor of the GRB. The extreme brightness of GRB 221009A allows us to probe its early afterglow in unprecedented detail. In this letter, we report comprehensive observation results of the early afterglow of GRB 221009A (from $T_0$+660 s to $T_0$+1860 s, where $T_0$ is the \textit{Insight}-HXMT/HE trigger time) in X/$\gamma$-ray energy band (from 20 keV to 20 MeV) by \textit{Insight}-HXMT/HE, GECAM-C and \textit{Fermi}/GBM. We find that the spectrum of the early afterglow in 20 keV-20 MeV could be well described by a cutoff power-law with an extra power-law which dominates the low and high energy bands respectively. The cutoff power-law $E_{\rm peak}$ is $\sim$ 30 keV and the power-law photon index is $\sim$ 1.8 throughout the early afterglow phase. By fitting the light curves in different energy bands, we find that a significant achromatic break (from keV to TeV) is required at $T_0$ + 1246$^{+27}_{-26}$ s (i.e. 1021 s since the afterglow starting time $T_{\rm AG}$=$T_0$+225 s), providing compelling evidence of a jet break. Interestingly, both the pre-break and post-break decay slopes vary with energy, and these two slopes become closer in the lower energy band, making the break less identifiable. Intriguingly, the spectrum of the early afterglow experienced a slight hardening before the break and a softening after the break. These results provide new insights into the understanding of this remarkable GRB.
