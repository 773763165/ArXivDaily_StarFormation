 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars are progenitors of supernovae, neutron stars and black holes. During the hydrogen-core burning phase their convective cores are the prime drivers of their evolution, but inferences of core masses are subject to unconstrained boundary mixing processes. Moreover, uncalibrated transport mechanisms can lead to strong envelope mixing and differential radial rotation. Ascertaining the efficiency of the transport mechanisms is challenging because of a lack of observational constraints. Here we deduce the convective core mass and robustly demonstrate non-rigid radial rotation in a supernova progenitor, the $12.0^{+1.5}_{-1.5}$ solar-mass hydrogen-burning star HD 192575, using asteroseismology, TESS photometry, high-resolution spectroscopy, and Gaia astrometry. We infer a convective core mass ($M_{\rm cc} = 2.9^{+0.5}_{-0.8}$ solar masses), and find the core to be rotating between 1.4 and 6.3 times faster than the stellar envelope depending on the location of the rotational shear layer. Our results deliver a robust inferred core mass of a massive star using asteroseismology from space-based photometry. HD 192575 is a unique anchor point for studying interior rotation and mixing processes, and thus also angular momentum transport mechanisms inside massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The recently discovered transiting super-Earth LP 890-9 c is potentially one of the best rocky exoplanets for atmospheric characterization. Orbiting an ultracool M-dwarf at the inner edge of the habitable zone, LP 890-9 c offers a new opportunity to study the climate of rocky planets at the inner edge of the habitable zone. We investigate the molecular detectability with simulated JWST transmission spectra for five potential atmospheres of LP 890-9 c. We find that a small three-transit JWST program can infer evidence of H2O (at 3$\sigma$ confidence) for a full runaway greenhouse scenario. Alternatively, CO2-dominated atmospheres resembling Venus without high-altitude terminator clouds can be identified with eight transits. However, these predictions could be complicated by the impact of clouds and/or unocculted starspots. Nevertheless, JWST observations of LP 890-9 c could provide critical insights and potentially distinguish between models of rocky planets at the inner edge of the habitable zone.
#### Evidence for a gamma-ray molecular target in the enigmatic PeVatron  candidate LHAASO J2108+5157

 - **Abstract**
 To determine the nature of the PeVatron's emission (hadronic or leptonic), it is essential to characterize the physical parameters of the environment from where it originates. We unambiguously confirm the association of molecular gas with the PeVatron candidate LHAASO J2108+5157 using unprecedented high angular-resolution (17$^{\prime \prime}$) $^{12,13}$CO($J$=1$\rightarrow$0) observations carried out with the Nobeyama 45m radio telescope. We characterize a molecular cloud in the vicinity of the PeVatron candidate LHAASO J2108+5157 by determining its physical parameters from our $^{12,13}$CO($J$=1$\rightarrow$0) line observations. We use an updated estimation of the distance to the cloud, which allows us to obtain a more reliable result. The molecular emission is compared with excess gamma-ray images obtained with Fermi--LAT at energies above 2 GeV to search for spatial correlations and test a possible hadronic ($\pi^0$ decay) origin for the gamma-ray emission. We find that the morphology of the spatial distribution of the CO emission is strikingly similar to that of the Fermi--LAT excess gamma-ray. By combining our observations with archival 21cm HI line data, the nucleons (HI + H$_2$) number density of the target molecular cloud is found to be 133.0 $\pm$ 45.0 cm$^{-3}$, for the measured angular size of 0.55 $\pm$ 0.02$^\circ$ at a distance of 1.6 $\pm$ 0.1 kpc. The resulting total mass of the cloud is M(HI +H$_2$) = 7.5$\pm$2.9$\times$10$^3$ M$_{\odot}$. Under a hadronic scenario, we obtain a total energy of protons of W$_p$ = 4.3$\pm$1.5 $\times$ 10$^{46}$ erg with a cutoff of 700$\pm$300 TeV, which reproduces the sub-PeV gamma-ray emission. We identified a molecular cloud in the vicinity of LHAASO J2107+5157 as the main target where cosmic rays from an unknown PeVatron produce the observed gamma-ray emission via $\pi^0$ decay.
#### Modeling of the nebular-phase spectral evolution of stripped-envelope  supernovae. New grids from 100 to 450 days

 - **Abstract**
 We present an extended grid of multi-epoch 1D nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer calculations for nebular-phase Type Ibc supernovae (SNe) from He-star explosions. Compared to Dessart+21, we study the spectral evolution from 100 to about 450d and augment the model set with progenitors that were evolved without wind mass loss. Models with the same final, preSN mass have similar yields and produce essentially the same emergent spectra. Hence, the uncertain progenitor mass loss history compromises the inference of the initial, main sequence mass. This shortcoming does not affect Type IIb SNe. However, our 1D models with a different preSN mass tend to yield widely different spectra, as seen through variations in the strong emission lines due to [NII]6548-6583, [OI]6300-6364, [CaII]7291-7323, [NiII]7378, and the forest of FeII lines below 5500A. At the lower mass end, the ejecta are He rich and at 100d cool through HeI, NII, CaII, and FeII lines, with NII and FeII dominating at 450d. These models, associated with He giants, conflict with observed SNe Ib, which typically lack strong NII emission. Instead they may lead to SNe Ibn or, because of additional stripping by a companion star, ultra-stripped SNe Ic. In contrast, for higher preSN masses, the ejecta are progressively He poor and cool at 100d through OI, CaII, and FeII lines, with OI and CaII dominating at 450d. Nonuniform, aspherical, large-scale mixing rather than composition differences likely determines the SN type at intermediate preSN masses. Variations in clumping, mixing, as well as departures from spherical symmetry would increase the spectral diversity but also introduce additional degeneracies. More robust predictions from spectral modeling require a careful attention to the initial conditions informed by physically-consistent 3D explosion models [abridged].

 - **Abstract**
 The homochirality of biological molecules on the Earth is a long-standing mystery regarding the origin of life. Circularly polarized ultraviolet (UV) light could induce the enantiomeric excess of biological molecules in the interstellar medium, leading to the homochirality on the earth. By performing 3D radiation transfer simulations with multiple scattering processes in interstellar dusty slabs, we study the generation of circular polarization (CP) of ultraviolet light at Lyman $\alpha$ ($\lambda = 0.1216~{\rm \mu m}$) as well as in the near-infrared (NIR, $\lambda = 2.14~{\rm \mu m}$) wavelengths. Our simulations show that the distributions of CP exhibit a symmetric quadrupole pattern, regardless of wavelength and viewing angle. The CP degree of scattered light from a dusty slab composed of aligned grains is $\sim 15$ percent for Ly$\alpha$ and $\sim 3$ percent at NIR wavelengths in the case of oblate grains with an MRN size distribution. We find that the CP degree of Ly$\alpha$ is well correlated with that in the NIR regardless of viewing angles, whilst being a factor of $\sim 5$ higher. Thus, high CP of Ly$\alpha$ is expected in sites where NIR CP is detected. We suggest that such circularly polarized Ly$\alpha$ may initiate the enantiomeric excess of biological molecules in space.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars are formed in molecular clouds, and produce H II regions when they evolve onto the main sequence. The expansion of H II region can both suppress and promote star formation in the vicinity. M17 H II region is a giant cometary H II region near many massive clumps containing starless and protostellar sources. It is an appropriate target to study the effect of feedback from previously formed massive stars on the nearby star-forming environments. Observations of SiO 2-1, HCO$^+$ 1-0, H$^{13}$CO$^+$ 1-0, HC$_3$N 10-9, and H41$\alpha$ lines are performed toward M17 H II region with ambient candidates of massive clumps. In the observations, the widespread shocked gas surrounding M17 H II region is detected: it probably originates from the collision between the expanding ionized gas and the ambient neutral medium. Some massive clumps are found in the overlap region of the shock and dense-gas tracing lines while the central velocities of shocked and high-density gases are similar. This suggests that part of massive clumps are located in the shell of H II region, and may be formed from the accumulated neutral materials in the shell. In addition, by comparing the observations toward M17 H II region with the simulation of cometary H II region, we infer the presence of one or more massive stars travelling at supersonic velocity with respect to the natal molecular cloud in the H II region.

 - **Abstract**
 Shocks are abundant in star-forming regions, and are often related with star formation. In our previous observations toward 100 starless clump candidates (SCCs) in the Galaxy, a sample of 34 SCCs associated with shocks is identified. In this work, we perform mapping observations of the SiO 2-1, 3-2, HC$_3$N 10-9, HCO$^+$ 1-0, H$^{13}$CO$^+$ 1-0, and H41$\alpha$ lines toward 9 out of the detected sources by using IRAM 30-m radio telescope to study the origins of the shocks in the SCCs. We find shocks in three sources (BGPS 3110, 3114, and 3118) are produced by collisions between the expanding ionized gas and ambient molecular gas, instead of by the star formation activity inside SCCs. On the other hand, shocks in the other six sources are related to star formation activity of SCCs. The signatures of protostellar outflows are clearly shown in the molecular lines toward BGPS 4029, 4472, 5064. Comparing our results with the previous ALMA observations performed in the same region, the shocks in BGPS 3686 and 5114 are also likely to be due to protostellar activity. The origin of shock in BGPS 5243 is still unclear although some features in the SiO spectra imply the presence of protostellar activity.

 - **Abstract**
 Determining the behaviour of convection and clouds is one of the biggest challenges in our understanding of exoplanetary climates. Given the lack of in situ observations, one of the most preferable approaches is to use cloud-resolving or cloud-permitting models (CPM). Here we present CPM simulations in a quasi-global domain with high spatial resolution (4$\times$4 km grid) and explicit convection to study the cloud regime of 1 to 1 tidally locked rocky planets orbiting around low-mass stars. We show that the substellar region is covered by deep convective clouds and cloud albedo increases with increasing stellar flux. The CPM produces relatively less cloud liquid water concentration, smaller cloud coverage, lower cloud albedo, and deeper H2O spectral features than previous general circulation model (GCM) simulations employing empirical convection and cloud parameterizations. Furthermore, cloud streets--long bands of low-level clouds oriented nearly parallel to the direction of the mean boundary-layer winds--appear in the CPM and substantially affect energy balance and surface precipitation at a local level.

 - **Abstract**
 We performed photometric observations of the S255, S257, S140, NGC7358 and the Orion~Bar photo-dissociation regions (PDRs) at 2 micron using narrow-band filters centered on the Br-gamma, H2 and [FeII] lines, as well as the narrow-band Kcont and the broad-band H filters for continuum subtraction. The observations were done with the 2.5-m telescope of the SAI Caucasian Mountain Observatory and the near-infrared camera and spectrograph ASTRONIRCAM. We find several high-density arc-like structures in the Br-gamma and [FeII] images of the ionized gas in NGC7538 and extended shells and arcs visible through the H2 emission. The H ionization front and H2 dissociation front are merged in NGC7538. In S255 and S257 we detected only Br-gamma emission from the HII regions and bright H2 emission from the PDRs. The projected distance between the H ionization and H2 dissociation fronts are approx. 0.3-0.4 pc, which cannot be explained using models of a uniform medium. Most probably, the ionized and neutral gas in these PDRs is clumpy. The H-to-H2 transitions in the NGC7538, S255, S257 and S140 PDRs are gradual with no sharp borders. This conclusion also confirms the suggestion of a clumpy medium.

 - **Abstract**
 As our nearest large neighbor, the Andromeda Galaxy provides a unique laboratory for investigating galaxy formation and the distribution and substructure properties of dark matter in a Milky Way-like galaxy. Here, we propose an initial 2-epoch ($\Delta t\approx 5$yr), 2-band Roman survey of the entire halo of Andromeda, covering 500 square degrees, which will detect nearly every red giant star in the halo (10$\sigma$ detection in F146, F062 of 26.5, 26.1AB mag respectively) and yield proper motions to $\sim$25 microarcsec/year (i.e., $\sim$90 km/s) for all stars brighter than F146 $\approx 23.6$ AB mag (i.e., reaching the red clump stars in the Andromeda halo). This survey will yield (through averaging) high-fidelity proper motions for all satellites and compact substructures in the Andromeda halo and will enable statistical searches for clusters in chemo-dynamical space. Adding a third epoch during the extended mission will improve these proper motions by $\sim t^{-1.5}$, to $\approx 11$ km/s, but this requires obtaining the first epoch in Year 1 of Roman operations. In combination with ongoing and imminent spectroscopic campaigns with ground-based telescopes, this Roman survey has the potential to yield full 3-d space motions of $>$100,000 stars in the Andromeda halo, including (by combining individual measurements) robust space motions of its entire globular cluster and most of its dwarf galaxy satellite populations. It will also identify high-velocity stars in Andromeda, providing unique information on the processes that create this population. These data offer a unique opportunity to study the immigration history, halo formation, and underlying dark matter scaffolding of a galaxy other than our own.
#### The OH Megamaser Emission in Arp\,220: the rest of the story

 - **Abstract**
 The OH Megamaser emission in the merging galaxy Arp220 has been re-observed with the Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN) and the European VLBI Network (EVN). Imaging results of the OH line emission at the two nuclei are found to be consistent with earlier observations and confirm additional extended emission structures surrounding the nuclei. Detailed information about the distributed emission components around the two nuclei has been obtained using a concatenated MERLIN and EVN database with intermediate (40 mas) spatial resolution. Continuum imaging shows a relatively compact West nucleus and a more extended East nucleus in addition to an extended continuum ridge stretching below and beyond the two nuclei. Spectral line imaging show extended emission regions at both nuclei together with compact components and additional weaker components north and south of the West nucleus. Spectral line analysis indicates that the dominant OH line emission originates in foreground molecular material that is part of a large-scale molecular structure that engulfs the whole nuclear region. Compact OH components are representative of star formation regions within the two nearly edge-on nuclei and define the systemic velocities of East and West as 5425 km/s and 5360 km/s. The foreground material at East and West has a 100 km/s lower velocity at 5314 and 5254 km/s. These emission results confirm a maser amplification scenario where the background continuum and the line emission of the star formation regions are amplified by foreground masering material that is excited by the FIR radiation field originating in the two nuclear regions.
#### Exploring the Evolution of Massive Clumps in Simulations that Reproduce  the Observed Milky Way α-element Abundance Bimodality

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way stellar disk has both a thin and a thick component. The thin disk is composed mostly of younger stars ($\lesssim$8 Gyr) with a lower abundance of $\alpha$ elements, while the thick disk contains predominantly older stars ($\gtrsim$8--12 Gyr) with a higher $\alpha$ abundance, giving rise to an $\alpha$-bimodality most prominent at intermediate metallicities. A proposed explanation for the bimodality is an episode of clumpy star formation, where high-$\alpha$ stars form in massive clumps that appear in the first few Gyrs of the Milky Way's evolution, while low-$\alpha$ stars form throughout the disk and over a longer time span. To better understand the evolution of clumps, we track them and their constituent stars in two clumpy Milky Way simulations that reproduce the $\alpha$-abundance bimodality, one with 10% and the other with 20% supernova feedback efficiency. We investigate the paths that these clumps take in the chemical space ([O/Fe]--[Fe/H]) as well as their mass, star formation rate (SFR), formation location, lifetime, and merger history. The clumps in the simulation with lower feedback last longer on average, with several lasting hundreds of Myr. Some of the clumps do not reach high-$\alpha$, but the ones that do on average had a higher SFR, longer lifetime, greater mass, and form closer to the galactic center than the ones that do not. Most clumps that reach high-$\alpha$ merge with others and eventually spiral into the galactic center, but shed stars along the way to form most of the thick disk component.
