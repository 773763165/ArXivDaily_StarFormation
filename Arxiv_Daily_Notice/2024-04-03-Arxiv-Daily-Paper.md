#### Likelihood-Based Jump Detection and Cosmic Ray Rejection for Detectors  Read Out Up-the-Ramp

 - **Abstract**
 This paper implements likelihood-based jump detection for detectors read out up-the-ramp, using the entire set of reads to compute likelihoods. The approach compares the $\chi^2$ value of a fit with and without a jump for every possible jump location. I show that this approach can be substantially more sensitive than one that only uses the difference between sequential groups of reads, especially for long ramps and for jumps that occur in the middle of a group of reads. It can also be implemented for a computational cost that is linear in the number of resultants. I provide and describe a pure Python implementation that can process a 10-resultant ramp on a $4096 \times 4096$ detector in $\approx$20 seconds, including iterative cosmic ray detection and removal, on a single core of a 2020 Macbook Air. This Python implementation, together with tests and a tutorial notebook, are available at \url{https://github.com/t-brandt/fitramp}. I also provide tests and demonstrations of the full ramp fitting and cosmic ray rejection approach on data from JWST.
#### On the Connection between the Repeated X-ray Quasi-periodic Oscillation  and Warm Absorber in the Active Galaxy RE~J1034+396

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct an in-depth spectral analysis of $\sim1{\rm ~Ms}$ XMM-Newton data of the narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy RE J1034+396. The long exposure ensures high spectral quality and provides us with a detailed look at the intrinsic absorption and emission features toward this target. Two warm-absorber (WA) components with different ionization states ($\log (\xi/{\rm erg~cm~s}^{-1}) \sim 4$ and $\log (\xi/{\rm erg~cm~s}^{-1}) \sim 2.5-3$) are required to explain the intrinsic absorption features in the RGS spectra. The estimated outflow velocities are around $-1400{\rm ~km~s}^{-1}$ and $-(100-300){\rm ~km~s}^{-1}$ for the high- and low-ionization WA components, respectively. Both absorbers are located beyond the broad-line region and cannot significantly affect the host environment. We analyze the warm absorbers in different flux states. We also examine the May-2007 observation in the low and high phases of quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO). In contrast to previous analyses showing a negative correlation between the high-ionization WA and the QPO phase, we have found no such variation in this WA component. We discover a broad emission bump in the spectral range of $\sim12-18$ Angstrom, covering the primary features of the high-ionization WA. This emission bump shows a dramatic change in different source states, and its intensity may positively correlate with the QPO phase. The absence of this emission bump in previous work may contribute to the suggested WA-QPO connection.

 - **Abstract**
 Low density plasmas in curved spacetimes, such as those found in accretion flows around black holes, are challenging to model from first principles, owing to the large scale separation between the characteristic scales of the microscopic processes and large mean-free-paths comparable to the system sizes. Kinetic approaches become necessary to capture the relevant physics but lack the dynamic range to model the global characteristics of the systems. In this paper, we develop new covariant guiding center equations of motion for charges in general relativistic spacetimes that are computationally tractable. We decompose the particle motion into a fast gyration, which we integrate analytically and a slow drift of the guiding center, which can be solved numerically. We derive covariant conservation laws for the motions of the guiding centers and show, through a number of limiting cases, that the equations contain all known drift mechanisms. Finally, we present the general relativistic expressions for the various drift velocities in Schwarzschild spacetimes.
#### Variations in Line Profiles of Atomic Transitions in RR Lyrae Stars

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01420
 - **Abstract**
 We have investigated the absorption shapes of atomic lines and H{\alpha} in RR Lyrae stars. We used the database of high resolution spectra gathered with the Las Campanas Observatory du Pont Telescope, analyzing a set of about 2700 short exposure spectra of 17 RRab and 5 RRc variables. To increase the signal-to-noise of the spectra for each star, we first co-added spectra in small photometric phase bins, and then co-added metallic line profiles in velocity space. The resulting line absorption shapes vary with photometric phase in a consistent manner for all RRab stars, while exhibiting no obvious phase-related variations for the RRc stars. We interpret these line profile variations in terms of velocity gradients in the photospheric layers that produce absorption line profiles. The H{\alpha} profiles are much broader, indicative of shock temperatures of order 100,000 K.
#### Laboratory demonstration of a Photonic Lantern Nuller in monochromatic  and broadband light

 - **Abstract**
 Photonic lantern nulling (PLN) is a method for enabling the detection and characterization of close-in exoplanets by exploiting the symmetries of the ports of a mode-selective photonic lantern (MSPL) to cancel out starlight. A six-port MSPL provides four ports where on-axis starlight is suppressed, while off-axis planet light is coupled with efficiencies that vary as a function of the planet's spatial position. We characterize the properties of a six-port MSPL in the laboratory and perform the first testbed demonstration of the PLN in monochromatic light (1569 nm) and in broadband light (1450 nm to 1625 nm), each using two orthogonal polarizations. We compare the measured spatial throughput maps with those predicted by simulations using the lantern's modes. We find that the morphologies of the measured throughput maps are reproduced by the simulations, though the real lantern is lossy and has lower throughputs overall. The measured ratios of on-axis stellar leakage to peak off-axis throughput are around 10^(-2), likely limited by testbed wavefront errors. These null-depths are already sufficient for observing young gas giants at the diffraction limit using ground-based observatories. Future work includes using wavefront control to further improve the nulls, as well as testing and validating the PLN on-sky.
#### Haro 11: The Spatially Resolved Lyman Continuum Sources

 - **Abstract**
 As the nearest confirmed Lyman continuum (LyC) emitter, Haro 11 is an exceptional laboratory for studying LyC escape processes crucial to cosmic reionization. Our new HST/COS G130M/1055 observations of its three star-forming knots now reveal that the observed LyC originates in Knots B and C, with $903 - 912~\r{A}$ luminosities of $1.9\pm1.5 \times 10^{40}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$ and $0.9\pm0.7 \times 10^{40}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, respectively. We derive local escape fractions $f_{\rm{esc, 912}} = 3.4\pm2.9\%$ and $5.1\pm4.3\%$ for Knots B and C, respectively. Our Starburst99 modeling shows dominant populations on the order of $\sim1-4$ Myr and $1-2\times10^7 \rm~M_\odot$ in each knot, with the youngest population in Knot B. Thus, the knot with the strongest LyC detection has the highest LyC production. However, LyC escape is likely less efficient in Knot B than in Knot C due to higher neutral gas covering. Our results therefore stress the importance of the intrinsic ionizing luminosity, and not just the escape fraction, for LyC detection. Similarly, the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction does not consistently correlate with LyC flux, nor do narrow Ly$\alpha$ red peaks. High observed Ly$\alpha$ luminosity and low Ly$\alpha$ peak velocity separation, however, do correlate with higher LyC escape. Another insight comes from the undetected Knot A, which drives the Green Pea properties of Haro 11. Its density-bounded conditions suggest highly anisotropic LyC escape. Finally, both of the LyC-leaking Knots, B and C, host ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). While stars strongly dominate over the ULXs in LyC emission, this intriguing coincidence underscores the importance of unveiling the role of accretors in LyC escape and reionization.
#### A Semi-blind Reconstruction of the History of Effective Number of  Neutrinos Using CMB Data

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the possibility of redshift-dependent deviations in the contribution of relativistic degrees of freedom to the radiation budget of the cosmos, conventionally parameterized by the effective number of neutrinos $N_{\rm eff}$, from the predictions of the standard model. We expand the deviations $\Delta N_{\rm eff}(z)$ in terms of top-hat functions and treat their amplitudes as the free parameters of the theory to be measured alongside the standard cosmological parameters by the Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, as well as performing forecasts for futuristic CMB surveys such as PICO and CMB-S4. We reconstruct the history of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ and find that with the current data the history is consistent with the standard scenario. Inclusion of the new degrees of freedom in the analysis increases $H_0$ to $68.71\pm 0.44$, slightly reducing the Hubble tension. With the smaller forecasted errors on the $\Delta N_{\rm eff}(z)$ parametrization modes from future CMB surveys, very accurate bounds are expected within the possible range of dark radiation models.

 - **Abstract**
 Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) provides the highest-resolution images in astronomy. The sharpest resolution is nominally achieved at the highest frequencies, but as the observing frequency increases so too does the atmospheric contribution to the system noise, degrading the sensitivity of the array and hampering detection. In this paper, we explore the limits of high-frequency VLBI observations using ngehtsim, a new tool for generating realistic synthetic data. ngehtsim uses detailed historical atmospheric models to simulate observing conditions, and it employs heuristic visibility detection criteria that emulate single- and multi-frequency VLBI calibration strategies. We demonstrate the fidelity of ngehtsim's predictions using a comparison with existing 230 GHz data taken by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), and we simulate the expected performance of EHT observations at 345 GHz. Though the EHT achieves a nearly 100% detection rate at 230 GHz, our simulations indicate that it should expect substantially poorer performance at 345 GHz; in particular, observations of M87 at 345 GHz are predicted to achieve detection rates of $\lesssim$20% that may preclude imaging. Increasing the array sensitivity through wider bandwidths and/or longer integration times -- as enabled through, e.g., the simultaneous multi-frequency upgrades envisioned for the next-generation EHT -- can improve the 345 GHz prospects and yield detection levels that are comparable to those at 230 GHz. M87 and Sgr A* observations carried out in the atmospheric window around 460 GHz could expect to regularly achieve multiple detections on long baselines, but analogous observations at 690 and 875 GHz consistently obtain almost no detections at all.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio photons interact with anisotropic density fluctuations in the heliosphere, which can alter their trajectory and influence properties deduced from observations. This is particularly evident in solar radio observations, where anisotropic scattering leads to highly-directional radio emissions. Consequently, observers at varying locations will measure different properties, including different source sizes, source positions, and intensities. However, it is not known if measurements of the decay time of solar radio bursts are also affected by the observer's position. Decay times are dominated by scattering effects, and so are frequently used as proxies of the level of density fluctuations in the heliosphere, making the identification of any location-related dependence crucial. We combine multi-vantage observations of interplanetary Type III bursts from four non-collinear, angularly-separated spacecraft with simulations, to investigate the dependence of both the decay- and rise-time measurements on the separation of the observer from the source. We propose a function to characterise the entire time profile of radio signals, allowing for the simultaneous estimation of the peak flux, decay time, and rise time, while demonstrating that the rise phase of radio bursts has a non-constant, non-exponential growth rate. We determine that the decay and rise times are independent of the observer's position, identifying them as the only properties to remain unaffected, thus not requiring corrections for the observer's location. Moreover, we examine the ratio between the rise and decay times, finding that it does not depend on the frequency. Therefore, we provide the first evidence that the rise phase is also significantly impacted by scattering effects, adding to our understanding of the plasma emission process.
#### Turning Spherical Cows into Spherical Cheeses: a bold and flavourful  re-Interpretation of the Moon's spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 "Everyone knows the moon is made of cheese..." This line, famously uttered by Wallace to his canine sidekick Gromit in the 80s classic, may be one of the most cruelly underappreciated movie quotations of our time. Indeed, while most scientists today would simply reject Wallace's claim as preposterous, we aim to revisit his theory on the composition of our natural satellite, revealing that it may not be as implausible as the scientific consensus would have it. Through a revelatory novel analysis of existing data, we will show that very simple cheese-based models can provide a convincing explanation of the Lunar surface's spectral characteristics in the near-infrared. Using the tried and tested PLS (Partial Least Squares) method, we efficiently and reliably retrieve the concentrations of various cheese types in different locations of the Lunar surface. Our results bring to light a bold and flavourful prediction about the Moon's composition, which lays the groundwork for an important paradigm shift in planetary sciences. We urge the scientific community to take a serious notice of this piquant novel interpretation, and strongly consider it in their future models of planetary composition and formation in our solar system and beyond.

 - **Abstract**
 The Hubble constant ($H_0$), a crucial parameter in cosmology, quantifies the expansion rate of the universe so its precise measurement is important to understand the fundamental dynamics of our evolving universe. One of the major limitations of measuring $H_0$ using time-delay cosmography is the presence of the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) in the lens mass modeling. We propose and quantitatively assess the use of galaxy-galaxy shear measurements to break the MSD in the strong lensing mass modeling. We use stacked galaxy-galaxy lensing profiles and corresponding covariance matrices from Huang et al. (2022) to constrain the MSD in lens mass modeling with a highly flexible mass profile. Our analyses show that if ideally all galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey can be used to constrain the MSD, we can achieve $\sim 10\%$ precision on the MSD constraint. We forecast that galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from LSST-like surveys can in general constrain the MSD with $\sim 1-3\%$ precision. Furthermore, if we push weak lensing measurements to a lower angular scale of $\sim 0.04$ $\rm Mpc$, a survey like LSST can provide $\sim 1\%$ precision on the MSD constraint, enabling a measurement of $H_0$ at the $1\%$ level. We demonstrate that galaxy-galaxy weak lensing can robustly constrain the MSD independent of stellar kinematics of the deflector, with wide-field survey data alone.
#### Blind QSO reconstruction challenge: Exploring methods to reconstruct the  Ly$α$ emission line of QSOs

 - **Abstract**
 Reconstructing the intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ line flux from high-$z$ QSOs can place constraints on the neutral hydrogen content of the intergalactic medium during reionisation. There are now $\gtrsim10$ different Ly$\alpha$ reconstruction pipelines using different methodologies to predict the Ly$\alpha$ line flux from correlations with the spectral information redward of Ly$\alpha$. However, there have been few attempts to directly compare the performance of these pipelines. Therefore, we devised a blind QSO challenge to compare these reconstruction pipelines on a uniform set of objects. Each author was provided de-identified, observed rest-frame QSO spectra with spectral information only redward of 1260\AA\ rest-frame to ensure unbiased reconstruction. We constructed two samples of 30 QSOs, from X-Shooter and SDSS both spanning $3.5<z<4.5$. Importantly, the purpose of this comparison study was not to champion a single, best performing reconstruction pipeline but rather to explore the relative performance of these pipelines over a range of QSOs with broad observational characteristics to infer general trends. In summary, we find machine learning approaches in general provide the strongest ``best guesses" but underestimate the accompanying statistical uncertainty, although these can be recalibrated, whilst pipelines that decompose the spectral information, for example principal component or factor analysis generally perform better at predicting the Ly$\alpha$ profile. Further, we found that reconstruction pipelines trained on SDSS QSOs performed similarly on average for both the X-Shooter and SDSS samples indicating no discernible biases owing to differences in the observational characteristics of the training set or QSO being reconstructed, although the recovered distributions of reconstructions for X-Shooter were broader likely due to an increased fraction of outliers.
#### PyCPL: The ESO Common Pipeline Library in Python v1.0

 - **Abstract**
 PyCPL provides full access to ESO's Common Pipeline Library ( CPL) for astronomical data reduction within a Python environment. Not only does it offer a Python interface to the robust CPL library, but it also lets users and developers fully utilise the rest of the scientific Python ecosystem. We have written a C++ layer to CPL and with pybind11 (a third-party library) created a Pythonic API to CPL. Since CPL has been around for so long, it has been thoroughly tested and understood. In 2003 it was developed in C due to its efficiency and speed of execution. With the community however moving away from C/C++ programming and embracing Python for data processing tasks, there is a need to provide access to the CPL utilities within a Python environment. With the latest version being released users can now install PyCPL to run existing CPL recipes (written in C) and access the results from Python. It also provides the ability to create new recipes in Python using the functionality provided by CPL.
#### Carbon isotope chemistry in protoplanetary disks: Effects of C/O ratios

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon isotope fractionation of CO has been reported in the disk around TW Hya,where elemental carbon is more abundant than elemental oxygen ([C/O]$_{\rm elem}$> 1). We investigated the effects of the [C/O]$_{\rm elem}$ ratio on carbon fractionation using astrochemical models that incorporate isotope-selective photodissociation and isotope-exchange reactions. The $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio could be lower than the elemental carbon isotope ratio due to isotope exchange reactions when the [C/O]$_{\rm elem}$ ratio exceeds unity. The observed $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO and H$^{12}$CN/H$^{13}$CN ratios around TW Hya could be reproduced when the [C/O]$_{\rm elem}$ ratio is 2~5. In the vicinity of the lower boundary of the warm molecular layer, the formation of ices leads to the gas phase [C/O]$_{\rm elem}$ ratio approaching unity, irrespective of the total (gas + ice) [C/O]$_{\rm elem}$ ratio. This phenomenon reduces the variation in the $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio across different [C/O]$_{\rm elem}$ ratios.

 - **Abstract**
 The Major Atmospheric Cherenkov Experiment (MACE) is a large size (21m) Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) installed at an altitude of 4270m above sea level at Hanle, Ladakh in northern India. Here we report the detection of Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission from Crab Nebula above 80 GeV. We analysed ~15 hours of data collected at low zenith angle between November 2022 and February 2023. The energy spectrum is well described by a log-parabola function with a flux of ~(3.46 +/- 0.26stat) x 10-10 TeV-1 cm-2 s-1, at 400 GeV with spectral index of 2.09 +/- 0.06stat and a curvature parameter of 0.08 +/- 0.07stat. The gamma-rays are detected in an energy range spanning from 80 GeV to ~5 TeV. The energy resolution improves from ~34% at an analysis energy threshold of 80 GeV to ~21% above 1 TeV. The daily light curve and the spectral energy distribution obtained for the Crab Nebula is in agreement with previous measurements, considering statistical and systematic uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we provide a new, well-controlled expansion of the equation of state of dense matter from zero to finite temperatures ($T$), while covering a wide range of charge fractions ($Y_Q$), from pure neutron to isospin symmetric nuclear matter. Our expansion can be used to describe neutron star mergers and core-collapse supernova explosions using as a starting point neutron star observations, while maintaining agreement with laboratory data, in a model independent way. We suggest new thermodynamic quantities of interest that can be calculated from theoretical models or directly inferred by experimental data that can help constrain the finite $T$ equation of state. With our new method, we can quantify the uncertainty in our finite $T$ and $Y_Q$ expansions in a well-controlled manner without making assumptions about the underlying degrees of freedom. We can reproduce results from a microscopic equation of state up to $T=100$ MeV for baryon chemical potential $\mu_B\gtrsim 1100$ MeV ($\sim1-2 \ n_{\rm sat}$) within $5\%$ error, with even better results for larger $\mu_B$ and/or lower $T$. We investigate the sources of numerical and theoretical uncertainty and discuss future directions of study.

 - **Abstract**
 Attitude is one of the crucial parameters for space objects and plays a vital role in collision prediction and debris removal. Analyzing light curves to determine attitude is the most commonly used method. In photometric observations, outliers may exist in the obtained light curves due to various reasons. Therefore, preprocessing is required to remove these outliers to obtain high quality light curves. Through statistical analysis, the reasons leading to outliers can be categorized into two main types: first, the brightness of the object significantly increases due to the passage of a star nearby, referred to as "stellar contamination," and second, the brightness markedly decreases due to cloudy cover, referred to as "cloudy contamination." Traditional approach of manually inspecting images for contamination is time-consuming and labor-intensive. However, We propose the utilization of machine learning methods as a substitute. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are employed to identify cases of stellar contamination and cloudy contamination, achieving F1 scores of 1.00 and 0.98 on test set, respectively. We also explored other machine learning methods such as Residual Network-18 (ResNet-18) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (lightGBM), then conducted comparative analyses of the results.

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia mission offers opportunities to search for compact binaries not involved in binary interactions (hereafter inert compact binaries), and results in the discoveries of binaries containing one black hole (BH) or one neutron star (NS), called ``Gaia BHs'' and ``Gaia NSs'', respectively. We have assessed if Gaia BHs and NSs can be formed in open clusters through dynamical interactions. In order to obtain a large number of inert compact binaries similar to Gaia BHs and NSs, we have performed gravitational $N$-body simulations for a large number of open clusters whose total mass is $1.2 \times 10^8 M_\odot$. These clusters have various masses, metallicities, densities, and binary fractions. We have found that open clusters form Gaia BHs ($10^{-6}$-$10^{-5} M_\odot^{-1}$) much more efficiently than Gaia NSs ($\lesssim 10^{-7} M_\odot^{-1}$) for any cluster parameters. This is quite inconsistent with observational results, because the reported numbers of Gaia BHs and NSs are $2$ and $\sim 20$, respectively. Additionally, we have switched off NS natal kicks for $10^4$ open clusters each weighing $10^3 M_\odot$ in order to retain a large number of NSs in open clusters. Then, open clusters form inert NS binaries originating from primordial binaries rather than formed through dynamical interactions. This means that Gaia NSs are formed dominantly on isolated fields, not in open clusters, if there is no NS natal kick. We have concluded that Gaia BHs can be dominantly formed in open clusters, however Gaia NSs cannot.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a systematic study on the light curves of type II supernovae (SNe II) to investigate how they are affected by the physical properties of the progenitor and the nature of the explosion. The calculations of pre-supernova evolution, the launch of the explosion, and the light curve are carried out by \texttt{MESA} and \texttt{STELLA}. Our study encompasses a wide range of zero-age-main-sequence (ZAMS) masses (10 - 20 $M_{\rm \odot}$), wind mass-loss rates (which control the range of hydrogen-rich envelope mass to be 3 - 12 $M_{\rm \odot}$), explosion energies (0.1 - 2.5 $\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg), and $^{56}$Ni masses (0 - 0.15 $M_{\rm \odot}$). Our analyses reveal that when the explosion energy is fixed, the light curve is primarily determined by the properties of the hydrogen-rich envelope, despite the large variation in the ZAMS masses. The dependencies of the light-curve characteristics on the envelope mass, radius, and explosion energy are investigated, and we establish the scaling relations connecting these quantities. We further derive a formula that corrects for effects of the $^{56}$Ni heating based on observables. Using the derived equations, we develop a method that can constrain the envelope mass with uncertainty within 1 $M_{\rm \odot}$ based on photometry. This method is applied to a large sample of $\sim$ 100 SNe II, which reveals a considerably broader range of the envelope masses estimated from observables as compared to those predicted by single star models evolving with standard stellar wind; this finding indicates that a large fraction of SNe II experience substantial mass-loss beyond the standard mass-loss prescription prior to their explosions, highlighting the uncertainties involved in the massive star evolution and pre-SN mass-loss mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 An inner companion has recently been discovered orbiting the prototype of classical Cepheids, delta Cep, whose orbital parameters are still not fully constrained. We collected new precise radial velocity measurements of delta Cep in 2019 using the HARPS-N spectrograph mounted at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. Using these radial velocity measurements, we aimed to improve the orbital parameters of the system. We considered a template available in the literature as a reference for the radial velocity curve of the pulsation of the star. We then calculated the residuals between our global dataset (composed of the new 2019 observations plus data from the literature) and the template as a function of the pulsation phase and the barycentric Julian date. This provides the orbital velocity of the Cepheid component. Using a Bayesian tool, we derived the orbital parameters of the system. Considering priors based on already published Gaia constraints, we find for the orbital period a maximum a posteriori probability of Porb=9.32+/-0.03 years (uncertainties correspond to the 95% highest density probability interval), and we obtain an eccentricity e=0.71+/-0.02, a semimajor axis a=0.029 +/-0.003 arcsecond, and a center-of-mass velocity V0=-17.28+/-0.08 km/s, among other parameters. In this short analysis we derive the orbital parameters of the delta Cep inner binary system and provide a cleaned radial velocity curve of the pulsation of the star, which will be used to study its Baade-Wesselink projection factor in a future publication.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes rely on the Earth's atmosphere as part of the detector. The presence of clouds affects observations and can introduce biases if not corrected for. Correction methods typically require an atmospheric profile, that can be measured with external atmospheric monitoring devices. We present a novel method for measuring the atmospheric profile using the data from Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes directly. The method exploits the comparison of average longitudinal distributions of the registered Cherenkov light between clear atmosphere and cloud presence cases. Using Monte Carlo simulations of a subarray of four Large-Sized Telescopes of the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory and a simple cloud model we evaluate the accuracy of the method in determining the basic cloud parameters. We find that the method can reconstruct the transmission of typical clouds with an absolute accuracy of a few per cent. For low-zenith observations, the height of the cloud centre can be reconstructed with a typical accuracy of a few hundred metres, while the geometrical thickness can be accurately reconstructed only if it is >= 3 km. We also evaluate the robustness of the method against the typical systematic uncertainties affecting atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes.
#### On the surface helium abundance of B-type hot subdwarf stars from the  WD+MS channel of Type Ia supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of intermediate helium (He)-rich hot subdwarfs are still unclear. Previous studies have suggested that some surviving Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) companions from the white dwarf~+~main-sequence (WD+MS) channel may contribute to the intermediate He-rich hot subdwarfs. However, previous studies ignored the impact of atomic diffusion on the post-explosion evolution of surviving companion stars of SNe Ia, leading to that they could not explain the observed surface He abundance of intermediate He-rich hot subdwarfs. In this work, by taking the atomic diffusion and stellar wind into account, we trace the surviving companions of SNe Ia from the WD+MS channel using the one-dimensional stellar evolution code \textsc{MESA} until they evolve into hot subdwarfs. We find that the surface He-abundances of our surviving companion models during their core He-burning phases are in a range of $-1 \lesssim {\rm log}(N_{\rm He}/N_{\rm H}) \lesssim 0$, which are consistent with those observed in intermediate He-rich hot subdwarfs. This seems to further support that surviving companions of SNe Ia in the WD+MS channel are possible to form some intermediate He-rich hot subdwarfs.
#### Synchro-curvature description of $γ$-ray light curves and spectra  of pulsars: global properties

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents a methodological approach to generate realistic $\gamma$-ray light curves of pulsars, resembling reasonably well the observational ones observed by the Fermi-Large Area Telescope instrument, fitting at the same time their high-energy spectra. The theoretical light curves are obtained from a spectral and geometrical model of the synchro-curvature emission. Despite our model relies on a few effective physical parameters, the synthetic light curves present the same main features observed in the observational $\gamma$-ray light curve zoo, such as the different shapes, variety in the number of peaks, and a diversity of peak widths. The morphological features of the light curves allows us to statistically compare the observed properties. In particular, we find that the proportion on the number of peaks found in our synthetic light curves is in agreement with the observational one provided by the third Fermi-LAT pulsar catalog. We also found that the detection probability due to beaming is much higher for orthogonal rotators (approaching 100%) than for small inclination angles (less than 20%).The small variation on the synthetic skymaps generated for different pulsars indicates that the geometry dominates over timing and spectral properties in shaping the gamma-ray light curves. This means that geometrical parameters like the inclination angle can be in principle constrained by gamma-ray data alone independently on the specific properties of a pulsar. At the same time, we find that $\gamma$-ray spectra seen by different observers can slightly differ, opening the door to constraining the viewing angle of a particular pulsar.

 - **Abstract**
 The first photometric light curve investigation of the NSVS 8294044, V1023 Her, and V1397 Her binary systems is presented. We used ground-based observations for the NSVS 8294044 system and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data for V1023 Her and V1397 Her. The primary and secondary times of minima were extracted from all the data, and by collecting the literature, a new ephemeris was computed for each system. Linear fits for the O-C diagrams were conducted using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Light curve solutions were performed using the PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) Python code and the MCMC approach. The systems were found to be contact binary stars based on the fillout factor and mass ratio. V1023 Her showed the O'Connell effect, and a cold starspot on the secondary component was required for the light curve solution. The absolute parameters of the system were estimated based on an empirical relationship between orbital period and mass. We presented a new T-M equation based on a sample of 428 contact binary systems and found that our three target systems were in good agreement with the fit. The positions of the systems were also depicted on the M-L, M-R, q-L_{ratio}, and M_{tot}-J_0 diagrams in the logarithmic scales.
#### A fading radius valley towards M-dwarfs, a persistent density valley  across stellar types

 - **Abstract**
 The radius valley separating super-Earths from mini-Neptunes is a fundamental benchmark for theories of planet formation and evolution. Observations show that the location of the radius valley decreases with decreasing stellar mass and with increasing orbital period. Here, we build from our previous pebble-based formation model, which, combined with photoevaporation after disc dispersal, unveiled the radius valley as a separator between rocky- and water-worlds. We expand our models for a range of stellar masses spanning from 0.1 to 1.5 $M_\odot$. We find that the location of the radius valley is well described by a power-law in stellar mass as $R_{\rm valley} = 1.8197 \, M_{\star}^{\!0.14({+0.02}/{-0.01})}$, which is in excellent agreement with observations. We also find very good agreement with the dependence of the radius valley on orbital period, both for FGK- and M-dwarfs. Additionally, we note that the radius valley gets filled towards low stellar masses, particularly at 0.1-0.4 $M_\odot$, yielding a rather flat slope in $R_{\rm valley} - P_{\rm orb}$. This is the result of orbital migration occurring at lower planet mass for less massive stars, which allows for low-mass water-worlds to reach the inner regions of the system, blurring the separation in mass (and size) between rocky- and water-worlds. Furthermore, we find that for planetary equilibrium temperatures above 400 K, the water in the volatile layer exists fully in the form of steam, puffing the planet radius up compared to condensed-water worlds. This produces an increase in planet radii of $\sim 30\%$ at 1 $M_\oplus$, and of $\sim 15\%$ at 5 $M_\oplus$, compared to condensed-water-worlds. As with Sun-like stars, pebble accretion leaves its imprint on the overall exoplanet population as a depletion of planets with intermediate compositions, carving a valley in planet density for all spectral types (abridged).

 - **Abstract**
 Thanks to the recent advancement in producing rare isotopes and measuring their masses with unprecedented precision, the updated nuclear masses around the waiting-point nucleus $^{64}$Ge in the rapid-proton capture process have led to a significant revision of the surface gravitational redshift of the neutron star (NS) in GS 1826-24 by re-fitting its X-ray burst light curve ({\it X. Zhou et al., Nature Physics {\bf 19}, 1091 (2023)}) using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). The resulting NS compactness $\xi$ is between 0.244 and 0.342 at 95\% confidence level and its upper boundary is significantly smaller than the maximum $\xi$ previously known. Incorporating this new data within a comprehensive Bayesian statistical framework, we investigate its impact on the Equation of State (EOS) of supradense neutron-rich matter and the required spin frequency for GW190814's minor $m_2$ with mass $2.59\pm 0.05$M$_{\odot}$ to be a rotationally stable pulsar. We found that the EOS of high-density symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) has to be softened significantly while the symmetry energy at supersaturation densities stiffened compared to our prior knowledge from earlier analyses using data from both astrophysical observations and terrestrial nuclear experiments. In particular, the skewness $J_0$ characterizing the stiffness of high-density SNM decreases significantly, while the slope $L$, curvature $K_{\rm{sym}}$, and skewness $J_{\rm{sym}}$ of nuclear symmetry energy all increase appreciably compared to their fiducial values. We also found that the most probable spin rate for the $m_2$ to be a stable pulsar is very close to its mass-shedding limit once the revised redshift data from GS 1826-24 is considered, making the $m_2$ unlikely the most massive NS observed so far.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the East-West asymmetry in energetic storm particle (ESP) heavy ion intensities at interplanetary shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) during solar cycles (SCs) 23 and 24. We use observations from NASA's ACE and STEREO missions of helium (He), oxygen (O), and iron (Fe) intensities from ~0.13 to 3 MeV/nucleon. We examine the longitudinal distribution of ESP intensities and the correlation of ESP intensities with the near-Sun CME speed and the average transit CME speed for eastern and western events. We observed an East-West asymmetry reversal of ESP heavy ion intensities from SC 23 to 24. We have determined that this change in asymmetry is caused by a shift in the heliolongitude distribution of the CME speed ratio (the ratio of CME near-Sun speed to CME average transit speed) from west to east.
#### Ram pressure stripping in clusters: Gravity can bind the ISM but not the  CGM

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the survival of a galaxy's circumgalactic medium (CGM) as it experiences ram pressure stripping (RPS) moving through the intracluster medium (ICM). For a satellite galaxy, the CGM is often assumed to be entirely stripped/evaporated, an assumption that may not always be justified. We carry out 3D-hydrodynamics simulations of RPS of the interstellar medium (ISM) and the CGM of a galaxy with mass and size comparable to the jellyfish galaxy JO201. We find that the CGM can survive long at cluster outskirts ($\gtrsim 2$ Gyr). However, at smaller cluster-centric distances, 90\% of the CGM mass is lost within $\sim 500$ Myr. Our simulations suggest that the gravitational restoring force on the CGM is mostly negligible and the CGM-ICM interaction is analogous to 'cloud-wind interaction'. The CGM stripping timescale depends not on the ram pressure but on $\chi$, the ratio of CGM to ICM density. Two distinct regimes emerge for CGM stripping: the $\chi >1$ regime, which is the well-known 'cloud-crushing' problem, and the $\chi < 1$ regime, which we refer to as the (relatively unexplored) 'bubble-drag' problem. The cloud-crushing regime ($\chi >1$) suggests a CGM stripping timescale proportional to the drag time $t_{\rm drag} \sim \chi R/v_{\rm rel}$ ($R$ is the CGM size, $v_{\rm rel}$ is the relative velocity). The bubble-drag regime ($\chi < 1$) is qualitatively different and gives a shorter stripping timescale comparable to the crossing time -- $t_{\rm drag} \sim R/v_{\rm rel}$, independent of $\chi$. The ISM stripping criterion unlike the CGM, still depends on the ram pressure $\rho_{\rm ICM} v_{\rm rel}^2$ (the classic Gunn and Gott 1972 condition). The stripped tails of satellites contain contributions from both the disk and its trailing CGM. Overall, we identify novel physical mechanisms and previously unexplored stripping regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe an X-ray source detection method entirely based on the maximum likelihood analysis, in application to observations with the ART-XC telescope onboard the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma observatory. The method optimally combines the data taken at different conditions, a situation commonly found in scanning surveys or mosaic observations with a telescope with a significant off-axis PSF distortion. The method can be naturally extended to include additional information from the X-ray photon energies, detector grades, etc. The likelihood-based source detection naturally results in a stable and uniform definition of detection thresholds under different observing conditions (PSF, background level). This greatly simplifies the statistical calibration of the survey needed to, e.g., obtain the $\log N - \log S$ distribution of detected sources or their luminosity function. The method can be applied to the data from any imaging X-ray telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 The ASTRI Mini-Array project, led by the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics, aims to construct and operate nine Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes for high-energy gamma-ray source study and stellar intensity interferometry. Located at the Teide Astronomical Observatory in Tenerife, the project's software is essential for remote operation, emphasizing the need for prompt feedback on observations. This contribution introduces the Online Observation Quality System (OOQS) as part of the Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) software. OOQS performs real-time data quality checks on data from Cherenkov cameras and Intensity Interferometry instruments. It provides feedback to SCADA and operators, highlighting abnormal conditions and ensuring quick corrective actions for optimal observations. Results are archived for operator visualization and further analysis. The OOQS data quality pipeline prototype utilizes a distributed application with three main components to handle the maximum array data rate of 1.15 Gb/s. The first is a Kafka consumer that manages the data stream from the Array Data Acquisition System through Apache Kafka, handling the data serialization and deserialization involved in the transmission. The data stream is divided into batches of data written in files. The second component monitors new files and conducts analyses using the Slurm workload scheduler, leveraging its parallel processing capabilities and scalability. Finally, the process results are collected by the last component and stored in the Quality Archive.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results of a dual eclipse expedition to observe the solar corona from two sites during the annular solar eclipse of 2023 October 14, using a novel coronagraph designed to be accessible for amateurs and students to build and deploy. The coronagraph "CATEcor" builds on the standardized eclipse observing equipment developed for the Citizen CATE 2024 experiment. The observing sites were selected for likelihood of clear observations, for historic relevance (near the Climax site in the Colorado Rocky Mountains), and for centrality to the annular eclipse path (atop Sandia Peak above Albuquerque, New Mexico). The novel portion of CATEcor is an external occulter assembly that slips over the front of a conventional dioptric telescope, forming a "shaded-truss" externally occulted coronagraph. CATEcor is specifically designed to be easily constructed in a garage or "makerspace" environment. We successfully observed some bright features in the solar corona to an altitude of approximately 2.25 R$_\odot$ during the annular phases of the eclipse. Future improvements to the design, in progress now, will reduce both stray light and image artifacts; our objective is to develop a design that can be operated successfully by amateur astronomers at sufficient altitude even without the darkened skies of a partial or annular eclipse.

 - **Abstract**
 AGILE is an Italian Space Agency (ASI) space mission launched in 2007 to study X-ray and gamma-ray phenomena in the energy range from $\sim$20 keV to $\sim$10 GeV. The AGILE AntiCoincidence System (ACS) detects hard-X photons in the 50 - 200 keV energy range and continuously stores each panel's count rates in the telemetry. We developed a new Deep Learning (DL) model to predict the background of the AGILE ACS top panel using the satellite's orbital and attitude parameters. This model aims to learn how the orbital and spinning modulations of the satellite impact the background level of the ACS top panel. The DL model executes a regression problem, and is trained with a supervised learning technique on a dataset larger than twenty million orbital parameters' configurations. Using a test dataset, we evaluated the trained model by comparison of the predicted count rates with the real ones. The results show that the model can reconstruct the background count rates of the ACS top panel with an accuracy of 96.7\%, considering the orbital modulation and spinning of the satellite. Starting from these promising results, we are developing an anomaly detection method to detect Gamma-ray Bursts when the differences between predicted and real count rates exceed a predefined threshold.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive reassessment of the state of Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) cosmology, namely models featuring a non-gravitational interaction between Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE). To achieve high generality, we extend the dark sector physics by considering two different scenarios: a non-dynamical DE equation of state $w_0\neq-1$, and a dynamical $w(a)=w_0+w_a(1-a)$. In both cases, we distinguish two different physical regimes resulting from a phantom or quintessence equation of state. To circumvent early-time superhorizon instabilities, the energy-momentum transfer should occur in opposing directions within the two regimes, resulting in distinct phenomenological outcomes. We study quintessence and phantom non-dynamical and dynamical models in light of two independent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments - the Planck satellite and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. We analyze CMB data both independently and in combination with Supernovae (SN) distance moduli measurements from the Pantheon-Plus catalog and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the SDSS-IV eBOSS survey. Our results update and extend the state-of-the-art analyses, significantly narrowing the parameter space allowed for these models and limiting their overall ability to reconcile cosmological tensions. Although considering different combinations of data leaves some freedom to increase $H_0$ towards the value measured by the SH0ES collaboration, our most constraining dataset (CMB+BAO+SN) indicates that fully reconciling the tension solely within the framework of IDE remains challenging.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the kinematics of a pillar, namely G287.76-0.87, using three rotational lines of $^{12}$CO(5-4), $^{12}$CO(8-7), $^{12}$CO(11-10), and a fine structure line of [OI] $63\,\mu$m Southern Carina observed by SOFIA/GREAT. This pillar is irradiated by the associated massive star cluster Trumpler 16, which includes $\eta$~Carina. Our analysis shows that the relative velocity of the pillar with respect to this ionization source is small, $\sim 1\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$, and the gas motion in the tail is more turbulent than in the head. We also performed analytical calculations to estimate the gas column density in local thermal equilibrium (LTE) conditions, which yields $N_{\rm CO}$ as $(\sim 0.2 -5)\times 10^{17}\,\rm cm^{-2}$. We further constrain the gas's physical properties in non-LTE conditions using RADEX. The non-LTE estimations result in $n_{\rm H_{2}} \simeq 10^{5}\,\rm cm^{-3}$ and $N_{\rm CO} \simeq 10^{16}\,\rm cm^{-2}$. We found that the thermal pressure within the G287.76-0.87 pillar is sufficiently high to make it stable for the surrounding hot gas and radiation feedback if the winds are not active. While they are active, stellar winds from the clustered stars sculpt the surrounding molecular cloud into pillars within the giant bubble around $\eta$~Carina.

 We present an approach to detecting (linear) gravitational wave memory in a Galactic core-collapse supernova using current interferometers. Gravitational wave memory is an important prediction of general relativity that has yet to be confirmed. Our approach uses a combination of Linear Prediction Filtering and Matched-Filtering. We present the results of our approach on data from core-collapse supernova simulations that span a range of progenitor mass and metallicity. We are able to detect gravitational wave memory out to 10 kpc. We also present the False Alarm Probabilities assuming an On-Source Window compatible with the presence of a neutrino detection.

 - **Abstract**
 Most brown dwarfs show some level of photometric or spectral variability. However, finding the most variable dwarfs more suited for a thorough variability monitoring campaign remained a challenge until a few years ago with the design of spectral indices to find the most likely L and T dwarfs using their near-infrared single-epoch spectrum. In this work, we designed and tested near-infrared spectral indices to pre-select the most likely variable L4-L8 dwarfs, complementing the indices presented by Ashraf et al. (2022) and Oliveros-Gomez et al. (2022). We used time-resolved near-infrared Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 spectra of an L6.0 dwarf, LP 261-75b, to design our novel spectral indices. We tested these spectral indices on 75 L4.0-L8.0 near-infrared SpeX/IRTF spectra, providing 27 new variable candidates. Our indices have a recovery rate of 80 percent and a false negative rate of 25 percent. All the known non-variable brown dwarfs were found to be non-variable by our indices. We estimated the variability fraction of our sample to be near 51 percent, which agrees with the variability fractions provided by Buenzli et al. (2014), Radigan et al. (2014), and Metchev et al. (2015) for L4-L8 dwarfs. These spectral indices may support in the future, the selection of the most likely variable directly-imaged exoplanets for studies with the James Webb Space Telescope and as well as the 30-m telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of narrow channels of accretion toward protostellar disks, known as streamers, have increased in number in the last few years. However, it is unclear if streamers are a common feature around protostars that were previously missed, or if they are a rare phenomenon. Our goals are to obtain the incidence of streamers toward a region of clustered star formation and to trace the origins of their gas, to determine if they originate within the filamentary structure of molecular clouds or from beyond. We used combined observations of the nearby NGC 1333 star-forming region, carried out with the NOEMA interferometer and the IRAM 30m single dish. Our observations cover the area between the IRAS 4 and SVS 13 systems. We traced the chemically fresh gas within NGC 1333 with HC3N molecular gas emission and the structure of the fibers in this region with N2H+ emission. We fit multiple velocity components in both maps and used clustering algorithms to recover velocity-coherent structures. We find streamer candidates toward 7 out of 16 young stellar objects within our field of view. This represents an incidence of approximately 40\% of young stellar objects with streamer candidates when looking at a clustered star forming region. The incidence increases to about 60\% when we considered only embedded protostars. All streamers are found in HC3N emission. Given the different velocities between HC3N and N2H+ emission, and the fact that, by construction, N2H+ traces the fiber structure, we suggest that the gas that forms the streamers comes from outside the fibers. This implies that streamers can connect cloud material that falls to the filaments with protostellar disk scales.
