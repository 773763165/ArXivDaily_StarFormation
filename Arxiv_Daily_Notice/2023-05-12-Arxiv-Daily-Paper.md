 - **Abstract**
 Stars with masses above 1.6 solar masses generally possess convective cores and radiative envelopes, which allows the propagation of outward-travelling internal gravity waves. We have studied the generation and propagation of IGWs in such stars using two-dimensional, fully nonlinear hydrodynamical simulations with realistic stellar reference states from the one-dimensional stellar evolution code, Modules for Stellar Astrophysics. Compared to previous similar works, this study utilises radius-dependent thermal diffusivity profiles for 5 different stellar masses at the middle of main sequence: 3 - 13 solar masses. From the simulations, we find that the surface perturbations are larger for higher masses, but no noticeable trends are observed for the frequency slopes with different stellar masses. The slopes are also similar to the results from previous works. We compare our simulation results with stellar photometric data from a recent survey and find that for frequency intervals above 8 microHz, there is a good agreement between the temperature frequency slopes from the simulations and the surface brightness variations of these observed stars, indicating that the brightness variations are caused by core-generated IGWs.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic bars, made up of elongated and aligned stellar orbits, can lose angular momentum via resonant torques with dark matter particles in the halo and slow down. Here we show that if a stellar bar is decelerated to zero rotation speed, it can flip the sign of its angular momentum and reverse rotation direction. We demonstrate this in a collisionless N-body simulation of a galaxy in a live counter-rotating halo. Reversal begins at small radii and propagates outward. The flip generates a kinematically-decoupled core both in the visible galaxy and in the dark matter halo, and counter-rotation generates a large-scale warp of the outer disk with respect to the bar.

 - **Abstract**
 Abundances of s-capture process elements in stars with exquisite asteroseismic, spectroscopic, and astrometric constraints offer a novel opportunity to study stellar evolution, nucleosynthesis, and Galactic chemical evolution. We aim to investigate one of the least studied s-process elements in the literature, Ce, using stars with asteroseismic constraints from the Kepler, K2 and TESS missions. We combine the global asteroseismic parameters derived from precise light curves obtained by the Kepler, K2 and TESS missions with chemical abundances from the APOGEE DR17 survey and astrometric data from the Gaia mission. Finally, we compute stellar ages using the code PARAM. We investigate the different trends of [Ce/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H], [alpha/Fe] and age considering the dependence on the radial position, specially in the case of K2 targets which cover a large Galactocentric range. We, finally, explore the [Ce/alpha] ratios as a function of age in different Galactocentric intervals. The studied trends display a strong dependence of the Ce abundances on [Fe/H] and star formation history. Indeed, the [Ce/Fe] ratio shows a non-monotonic dependence on [Fe/H] with a peak around -0.2 dex. Moreover, younger stars have higher [Ce/Fe] and [Ce/alpha] ratios than older stars, confirming the latest contribution of low- and intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch stars to the Galactic chemical enrichment. In addition, the trends of [Ce/Fe] and [Ce/alpha] with age become steeper moving towards the outer regions of the Galactic disc, demonstrating a more intense star formation in the inner regions than in the outer regions. Ce is thus a potentially interesting element to help constraining stellar yields and the inside-out formation of the Milky Way disc. However, the large scatter in all the relations studied here, suggests that spectroscopic uncertainties for this element are still too large.

 - **Abstract**
 Wide-field and deep DECam multi-band photometry, combined with HST data for the core of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 2808, allowed us to study the distribution of various stellar sub-populations and stars in different evolutionary phases out to the cluster tidal radius. We used the C_ugi = (u-g)-(g-i) index to identify three chemically distinct sub-populations along the red giant branch and compared their spatial distributions. The most light-element enriched sub-population (P3) is more centrally concentrated; however, it shows a more extended distribution in the external regions of the cluster compared to the primordial (P1) and intermediate (P2) composition populations. Furthermore, the P3 sub-population centroid is off-center relative to those of the P1 and P2 groups. We also analyzed the spatial distribution of horizontal branch stars and found that the relative fraction of red horizontal branch stars increases for radial distances larger than ~ 1.5' while that of the blue and hotter stars decreases. These new observations, combined with literature spectroscopic measurements, suggest that the red horizontal branch stars are the progeny of all the stellar sub-populations in NGC 2808, i.e. primordial and light-element enhanced, while the blue stars are possibly the result of a combination of the "hot-flasher" and the "helium-enhanced" scenarios. A similar distribution of different red giant branch sub-populations and horizontal branch stars was also found for the most massive Galactic globular cluster, omega Cen, based on combined DECam and HST data, which suggests the two may share a similar origin.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray satellite has detected six Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) located in the Gould Belt and the Aquila Rift regions. In half of these objects (Taurus, Orion A, Orion B), the observed gamma-ray spectrum can be explained using the Galactic diffused Cosmic Ray (CR) interactions with the gas environments. In the remaining three GMCs (Rho Oph, Aquila Rift, Cepheus), the origin of the gamma-ray spectrum is still not well established. We use the GEometry ANd Tracking (GEANT4) simulation framework in order to simulate gamma-ray emission due to CR/GMC interaction in these three objects, taking into account the gas density distribution inside the GMCs. We find that propagation of diffused Galactic CRs inside these GMCs can explain the Fermi-LAT detected gamma-ray spectra. Further, our estimated TeV-PeV fluxes are consistent with the HAWC upper limits, available for the Aquila Rift GMC. As last step, we compute the total neutrino flux estimated for these GMCs and compare it with the IceCube detection sensitivity.

 - **Abstract**
 Neptune's tropospheric winds are among the most intense in the Solar System, but the dynamical mechanisms that produce them remain uncertain. Measuring wind speeds at different pressure levels may help understand the atmospheric dynamics of the planet. The goal of this work is to directly measure winds in Neptune's stratosphere with ALMA Doppler spectroscopy. We derived the Doppler lineshift maps of Neptune at the CO(3-2) and HCN(4-3) lines at 345.8 GHz ($\lambda$~0.87 mm) and 354.5 GHz (0.85 mm), respectively. For that, we used spectra obtained with ALMA in 2016 and recorded with a spatial resolution of ~0.37" on Neptune's 2.24" disk. After subtracting the planet solid rotation, we inferred the contribution of zonal winds to the measured Doppler lineshifts at the CO and HCN lines. We developed an MCMC-based retrieval methodology to constrain the latitudinal distribution of wind speeds. We find that CO(3-2) and HCN(4-3) lines probe the stratosphere of Neptune at pressures of $2^{+12}_{-1.8}$ mbar and $0.4^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$ mbar, respectively. The zonal winds at these altitudes are less intense than the tropospheric winds based on cloud tracking from Voyager observations. We find equatorial retrograde (westward) winds of $-180^{+70}_{-60}$ m/s for CO, and $-190^{+90}_{-70}$ m/s for HCN. Wind intensity decreases towards mid-latitudes, and wind speeds at 40$^\circ$S are $-90^{+50}_{-60}$ m/s for CO, and $-40^{+60}_{-80}$ m/s for HCN. Wind speeds become 0 m/s at about 50$^\circ$S, and we find that the circulation reverses to a prograde jet southwards of 60$^\circ$S. Overall, our direct stratospheric wind measurements match previous estimates from stellar occultation profiles and expectations based on thermal wind equilibrium. These are the first direct Doppler wind measurements performed on the Icy Giants, opening a new method to study and monitor their stratospheric dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive close binary stars with extremely small separations have been observed, and they are possible progenitors of gravitational-wave sources. The evolution of massive binaries in the protostellar accretion stage is key to understanding their formation process. We, therefore, investigate how close the protostars, consisting of a high-density core and a vast low-density envelope, can approach each other but not coalesce. To investigate the coalescence conditions, we conduct smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations following the evolution of equal-mass binaries with different initial separations. Since Population (Pop) I and III protostars have similar interior structures, we adopt a specific Pop~III model with the mass and radius of $7.75\;M_{\odot}$ and $61.1\;R_{\odot}$ obtained by the stellar evolution calculations. Our results show that the binary separation decreases due to the transport of the orbital angular momentum to spin angular momentum. If the initial separation is less than about 80 per~cent of the sum of the protostellar radius, the binary coalesces in a time shorter than the tidal lock timescale. The mass loss up to the merging is $\lesssim 3$ per~cent. After coalescence, the star rotates rapidly, and its interior structure is independent of the initial separation. We conclude that there must be some orbital shrinking mechanism after the protostars contract to enter the zero-age main-sequence stage.
