 - **Abstract**
 Mergers between helium white dwarfs and main-sequence stars are likely common, producing red giant-like remnants making up roughly a few percent of all low-mass ($\lesssim2M_\odot$) red giants. Through detailed modelling, we show that these merger remnants possess distinctive photometric, asteroseismic, and surface abundance signatures through which they may be identified. During hydrogen shell burning, merger remnants reach higher luminosities and possess pulsations which depart from the usual degenerate sequence on the asteroseismic $\Delta\nu$--$\Delta\Pi$ diagram for red giant branch stars. For sufficiently massive helium white dwarfs, merger remnants undergo especially violent helium flashes which can dredge up a large amount of core material (up to $\sim0.1M_\odot$) into the envelope. Such post-dredge-up remnants are more luminous than normal red clump stars, surface carbon-rich, and possess a wider range of asteroseismic g-mode period spacings and mixed-mode couplings. Recently discovered low-mass ($\lesssim0.8M_\odot$) red clump stars may be core helium-burning remnants of mergers involving lower-mass helium white dwarfs.
#### JWST ERS Program Q3D: The pitfalls of virial BH mass constraints shown  in a z = 3 quasar with an ultramassive host

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST MIRI/NIRSpec observations of the extremely red quasar SDSS J165202.64+172852.3 at z~3, one of the most luminous quasars known to date, driving powerful outflows and hosting a clumpy starburst, amidst several interacting companions. We estimate the black hole (BH) mass of the system based on the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines, as well as the Pa$\beta$ emission in the IR and MgII in the UV. We recover a very broad range of mass estimates, with constraints ranging between log $M_{\rm BH}$=9 and 10.1, which is exacerbated if imposing a uniform BLR geometry at all wavelengths. Several factors may contribute to the large spread: measurement uncertainties (insufficient sensitivity to detect the broadest component of the faint Pa$\beta$ line, spectral blending, ambiguities in the broad/narrow component distinction), lack of virial equilibrium (in a system characterised by powerful outflows and rapid accretion), and uncertainties on the luminosity-inferred size of the broad line region, a.o. given central dust obscuration. We constrain the stellar mass via SED fitting, suggesting the host to be extremely massive at $10^{12.8\pm 0.5} M_\odot$ - ~2 dex above the characteristic mass of the Schechter fit to the z=3 stellar mass function. Notably, J1652's central BH might be interpreted as being either undermassive, overmassive, or in line with the BH mass-stellar mass relation, depending on the choice of assumptions. The recovered Eddington ratio varies accordingly, but exceeds 10% in any case. We put our results into context by providing an extensive overview and discussion of recent literature results and their associated assumptions. Our findings provide an important demonstration of the uncertainties inherent in virial BH mass estimates, which are of particular relevance in the JWST era given the growing number of studies on rapidly accreting quasars at high redshift.

 - **Subjects:** Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14483
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14483
 - **Abstract**
 We introduce APPLE, a novel planetary evolution code designed specifically for the study of giant exoplanet and Jovian planet evolution in the era of Galileo, Juno, and Cassini. With APPLE, state-of-the-art equations of state for hydrogen, helium, ice, and rock are integrated with advanced features to treat ice/rock cores and metals in the gaseous envelope; models for helium rain and hydrogen/helium immiscibility; detailed atmosphere boundary tables that also provide self-consistent albedos and spectra; and options to address envelope metal gradients and stably-stratified regions. Our hope is that these purpose-built features of APPLE will help catalyze the development of the next generation of giant exoplanet and Jovian planet evolutionary models.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14484
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14484
 - **Abstract**
 We present Paicos, a new object-oriented Python package for analyzing simulations performed with Arepo. Paicos strives to reduce the learning curve for students and researchers getting started with Arepo simulations. As such, Paicos includes many examples in the form of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks as well as an online documentation describing the installation procedure and recommended first steps. Paicos' main features are automatic handling of cosmological and physical units, computation of derived variables, 2D visualization (slices and projections), 1D and 2D histograms, and easy saving and loading of derived data including units and all the relevant metadata.
#### Impact of main-sequence mass loss on the appearance, structure and  evolution of Wolf-Rayet stars

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar winds are one of the most important drivers of massive star evolution and a vital source of chemical, mechanical, and radiative feedback. Despite its significance, mass loss remains a major uncertainty in stellar evolution models. Particularly the interdependencies of different approaches with subsequent evolutionary stages and predicted observable phenomena are far from being systematically understood. In this study, we examine the impact of main sequence mass loss on the structure of massive stars throughout their evolution. A particular focus is placed on the consequences for entering the Wolf-Rayet (WR) regime and the subsequent evolution. Using the Geneva stellar evolution code, we compute grids of single, non-rotating stellar models at solar and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) metallicity of initial masses between 20 and 120 solar masses, with two representative prescriptions for high and low main sequence mass loss. We obtain detailed numerical predictions regarding the structure and evolution of massive stars, and infer the role of main sequence mass loss by comparison of the mass-loss rate prescriptions. We present implications for the overall evolutionary trajectory, including the evolution of WR stars, as well as the effect on stellar yields and stellar populations. Mass loss during the main sequence plays an important role due to its ability to affect the sequence and duration of all subsequent phases. We identify several distinct evolutionary paths for massive stars which are significantly influenced by the chosen main sequence mass-loss description. We also discuss the impact of uncertainties other than mass loss on the evolution, in particular those relating to convection. We further demonstrate that not just the total mass loss, but the specific mass-loss history throughout a star's life is a crucial determinant of many aspects, such as the resulting stellar yields.
#### Formation of low mass protostars and their circumstellar disks

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14496
 - **Abstract**
 The birth process of circumstellar disks remains poorly constrained due to observational and numerical challenges. Recent numerical works have shown that the small-scale physics, often wrapped into a sub-grid model, play a crucial role in disk formation and evolution. This calls for a combined approach in which both the protostar and circumstellar disk are studied in concert. We aim to elucidate the small scale physics and constrain sub-grid parameters commonly chosen in the literature by resolving the star-disk interaction. We carry out a set of very high resolution 3D radiative-hydrodynamics simulations that self-consistently describe the collapse of a turbulent dense molecular cloud core to stellar densities. We study the birth of the protostar, the circumstellar disk, and its early evolution (< 6 yr after protostellar formation). Following the second gravitational collapse, the nascent protostar quickly reaches breakup velocity and sheds its surface material, thus forming a hot ($\sim 10^{3}$ K), dense, and highly flared circumstellar disk. The protostar is embedded within the disk, such that material can flow without crossing any shock fronts. The circumstellar disk mass quickly exceeds that of the protostar, and its kinematics are dominated by self-gravity. Accretion onto the disk is highly anisotropic, and accretion onto the protostar mainly occurs through material that slides on the disk surface. The polar mass flux is negligible in comparison. The radiative behavior also displays a strong anisotropy, as the polar accretion shock is shown to be supercritical whereas its equatorial counterpart is subcritical. We also find a remarkable convergence of our results with respect to initial conditions. These results reveal the structure and kinematics in the smallest spatial scales relevant to protostellar and circumstellar disk evolution.
#### The CO-to-H$_2$ Conversion Factor in the Barred Spiral Galaxy M83
 - **Authors:** Amanda M Lee, Jin Koda, Akihiko Hirota, Fumi Egusa, Mark Heyer

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14503
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14503
 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$) in the nearby barred spiral galaxy M83. We present new HI observations from the JVLA and single-dish GBT in the disk of the galaxy, and combine them with maps of CO(1-0) integrated intensity and dust surface density from the literature. $\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$ and the gas-to-dust ratio ($\delta_{\rm{GDR}}$) are simultaneously derived in annuli of 2 kpc width from R = 1-7 kpc. We find that $\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$ and $\delta_{\rm{GDR}}$ both increase radially, by a factor of $\sim$ 2-3 from the center to the outskirts of the disk. The luminosity-weighted averages over the disk are $\alpha_{\rm{CO}} = 3.14$ (2.06, 4.96) M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$[K$\cdot$ km s$^{-1}$]$^{-1}$ and $\delta_{\rm{GDR}}$ = 137 (111, 182) at the 68% (1$\sigma$) confidence level. These are consistent with the $\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$ and $\delta_{\rm{GDR}}$ values measured in the Milky Way. In addition to possible variations of $\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$ due to the radial metallicity gradient, we test the possibility of variations in $\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$ due to changes in the underlying cloud populations, as a function of galactic radius. Using a truncated power-law molecular cloud CO luminosity function and an empirical power-law relation for cloud-mass and luminosity, we show that the changes in the underlying cloud population may account for a factor of $\sim 1.5-2.0$ radial change in $\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will conduct an unprecedented optical survey of the southern sky, imaging the entire available sky every few nights for 10 years. To achieve its ambitious science goals of probing dark energy and dark matter, mapping the Milky Way, and exploring the transient optical sky, the systematic errors in the LSST data must be exquisitely controlled. Instrument signature removal (ISR) is a critical early step in LSST data processing to remove inherent camera effects from the raw images and produce accurate representations of the incoming light. This paper describes the current state of the ISR pipelines implemented in the LSST Science Pipelines software. The key steps in ISR are outlined, and the process of generating and verifying the necessary calibration products to carry out ISR is also discussed. Finally, an overview is given of how the Rubin data management system utilizes a data Butler and calibration collections to organize datasets and match images to appropriate calibrations during processing. Precise ISR will be essential to realize the potential of LSST to revolutionize astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 This work reports a novel plasma wave observation in the near-Sun solar wind: frequency-dispersed ion acoustic waves. Similar waves were previously reported in association with interplanetary shocks or planetary bow shocks, but the waves reported here occur throughout the solar wind sunward of $\sim 60$ solar radii, far from any identified shocks. The waves reported here vary their central frequency by factors of 3 to 10 over tens of milliseconds, with frequencies that chirp up or down in time. Using a semi-automated identification algorithm, thousands of wave instances are recorded during each near-Sun orbit of the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft. Wave statistical properties are determined and used to estimate their plasma frame frequency and the energies of protons most likely to be resonant with these waves. Proton velocity distribution functions are explored for one wave interval, and proton enhancements that may be consistent with proton beams are observed. A conclusion from this analysis is that properties of the observed frequency-dispersed ion acoustic waves are consistent with driving by cold, impulsively accelerated proton beams near the ambient proton thermal speed. Based on the large number of observed waves and their properties, it is likely that the impulsive proton beam acceleration mechanism generating these waves is active throughout the inner heliosphere. This may have implications for acceleration of the solar wind.
#### A Blueprint for the Milky Way's Stellar Populations. V. 3D Local Dust  Extinction

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14626
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14626
 - **Abstract**
 Using a grid of empirically calibrated synthetic spectra developed in our previous study, we construct an all-sky 3D extinction map from the large collection of low-resolution XP spectra in Gaia DR3. Along each line of sight, with an area ranging from $0.2$ to $13.4$ deg$^2$, we determine both the reddening and metallicity of main-sequence stars and model the foreground extinction up to approximately $3$ kpc from the Sun. Furthermore, we explore variations in the total-to-selective extinction ratio in our parameter search and identify its mean systematic change across diverse cloud environments in both hemispheres. In regions outside the densest parts of the clouds, our reddening estimates are validated through comparisons with previous reddening maps. However, a notable discrepancy arises in comparison to other independent work based on XP spectra, which can be attributed to systematic offsets in their metallicity estimates. On the other hand, our metallicity scale exhibits reasonable agreement with the high-resolution spectroscopic abundance scale. We also assess the accuracy of the XP spectra by applying our calibrated models, and we confirm an increasing trend of flux overestimation at shorter wavelengths below $400$ nm.
#### Planetary nebula morphologies indicate a jet-driven explosion of SN  1987A and other core-collapse supernovae

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14843
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14843
 - **Abstract**
 I demonstrate the usage of planetary nebulae (PNe) to infer that a pair of jets shaped the ejecta of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 1987A. The main structure of the SN 1987A inner ejecta, the keyhole, comprised two low-intensity zones. The northern one has a bright rim on its front, while the southern one has an elongated nozzle. Earlier comparison of the SN 1987A keyhole with bubbles in the galaxy group NGC 5813 led to its identification as a jet-shaped rim-nozzle structure. Here, I present rim-nozzle asymmetry in planetary nebulae (PNe), thought to be shaped by jets, which solidify the claim that jets powered the ejecta of SN 1987A and other CCSNe. This finding for the iconic SN 1987A with its unique properties strengthens the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe. In a few hundred years, the CCSN 1987A will have a complicated structure with two main symmetry axes, one along the axis of the three circumstellar rings that two opposite 20,000-years pre-explosion jets shaped, and the other along the long axis of the keyhole that was shaped by the main jet pair of the exploding jets of SN 1987A in the frame of the JJEM.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar winds of cool main sequence stars are very difficult to constrain observationally. One way to measure stellar mass loss rates is to detect soft X-ray emission from stellar astrospheres produced by charge exchange between heavy ions of the stellar wind and cold neutrals of the interstellar medium (ISM) surrounding the stars. Here we report detections of charge-exchange induced X-ray emission from the extended astrospheres of three main sequence stars, 70 Ophiuchi, epsilon Eridani, and 61 Cygni based on analysis of observations by XMM-Newton. We estimate the corresponding mass loss rates to be 66.5 +- 11.1, 15.6 +- 4.4, and 9.6 +- 4.1 times the solar mass loss rate for 70 Ophiuchi, epsilon Eridani, and 61 Cygni, respectively, and compare our results to the hydrogen wall method. We also place upper limits on the mass loss rates of several other main sequence stars. This method has potential utility for determining the mass loss rates from X-ray observations showing spatial extension beyond a coronal point source.
#### The Solar System: structural overview, origins and evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the origin and long-term evolution of the Solar System is a fundamental goal of planetary science and astrophysics. This chapter describes our current understanding of the key processes that shaped our planetary system, informed by empirical data such as meteorite measurements, observations of planet-forming disks around other stars, and exoplanets, and nourished by theoretical modeling and laboratory experiments. The processes at play range in size from microns to gas giants, and mostly took place within the gaseous planet-forming disk through the growth of mountain-sized planetesimals and Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos. A fundamental shift in our understanding came when it was realized (thanks to advances in exoplanet science) that the giant planets' orbits likely underwent large radial shifts during their early evolution, through gas- or planetesimal-driven migration and dynamical instability. The characteristics of the rocky planets (including Earth) were forged during this early dynamic phase. Our Solar System is currently middle-aged, and we can use astrophysical tools to forecast its demise in the distant future.
#### On the impact of the vertical structure of Martian water ice clouds on  nadir atmospheric retrievals from simultaneous EMM/EXI and TGO/ACS-MIR  observations

 - **Abstract**
 Retrieving the optical depth of the Martian clouds ($\tau_\mathrm{cld}$) is a powerful way to monitor their spatial and temporal evolution. However, such retrievals from nadir imagery rely on several assumptions, including the vertical structure of the clouds in the atmosphere. Here we compare the results of cloud optical depth retrievals from the Emirates eXploration Imager (EXI) onboard the Emirates Mars Mission (EMM) "Hope" orbiter performed using an empirical cloud profile (typically used in similar studies) and using derived cloud profiles obtained from near-simultaneous Solar Occultation observations from the Middle-Infrared channel of the Atmospheric Chemistry Suite (ACS) instrument onboard the ESA Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO). We show that the latitudinal dependence of the cloud vertical profiles can have a strong impact on the nadir retrievals; neglecting it can lead to a significant underestimation of $\tau_\mathrm{cld}$ in the polar regions (up to 25 %). We also discuss the impact of a vertically-dependent particle size profile, as previous studies have shown the presence of very small water ice particles at the top of the clouds. From this analysis, we provide recommendations for the improvement of water ice cloud parameterization in radiative transfer algorithms in nadir atmospheric retrievals.

 - **Abstract**
 The science program of the Radio Neutrino Observatory-Greenland (RNO-G) extends beyond particle astrophysics to include radioglaciology and, as we show herein, solar physics, as well. Impulsive solar flare observations not only permit direct measurements of light curves, spectral content, and polarization on time scales significantly shorter than most extant dedicated solar observatories, but also offer an extremely useful above-surface calibration source, with pointing precision of order tens of arc-minutes. Using the early RNO-G data from 2022-2023, observed flare characteristics are compared to well-established solar observatories. Also, a number of individual flares are used to highlight angular reconstruction and calibration methods. RNO-G observes signal excesses during solar flares reported by the solar-observing Callisto network and in coincidence with about 60% of the brightest excesses recorded by the SWAVES satellite, when the Sun is above the horizon for RNO-G. In these observed flares, there is significant impulsivity in the time-domain. In addition, the solar flares are used to calibrate the RNO-G absolute pointing on the radio signal arrival direction to sub-degree resolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We study long-term evolution of the matter ejected in a black-hole neutron-star (BH-NS) merger employing the results of a long-term numerical-relativity simulation and nucleosynthesis calculation, in which both dynamical and post-merger ejecta formation are consistently followed. In particular, we employ the results for the merger of a $1.35\,M_\odot$ NS and a $5.4\,M_\odot$ BH with the dimensionless spin of 0.75. We confirm the finding in the previous studies that thermal pressure induced by radioactive heating in the ejecta significantly modifies the morphology of the ejecta. We then compute the kilonova (KN) light curves employing the ejecta profile obtained by the long-term evolution. We find that our present BH-NS model results in a KN light curve that is fainter yet more enduring than that observed in AT2017gfo. This is due to the fact that the emission is primarily powered by the lanthanide-rich dynamical ejecta, in which a long photon diffusion time scale is realized by the large mass and high opacity. While the peak brightness of the KN emission in both the optical and near-infrared bands is fainter than or comparable to those of binary NS models, the time-scale maintaining the peak brightness is much longer in the near-infrared band for the BH-NS KN model. Our result indicates that a BH-NS merger with massive ejecta can observationally be identified by the bright and long lasting ($>$two weeks) near-infrared emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently we had reported commissioning of a prototype for pulsar observations at low radio frequencies (<100 MHz) using log-periodic dipole antennas (LPDAs) in the Gauribidanur Radio Observatory near Bangalore in India. The aforementioned system (GAuribidanur Pulsar System, GAPS) is currently being augmented to directly digitize the radio frequency signals from the individual antennas in the array. Our initial results using 1-bit raw voltage recording system indicates that such a back-end receiver offers distinct advantages like, (i) simultaneous observations of any set of desired directions in the sky with multiple offline beams and smaller data rate/volume, (ii) archival of the observed data with minimal resources for re-analysis in the future, either in the same or different set of directions in the sky.
#### Quantum study of the CH$_3^+$ photodissociation in full dimension Neural  Networks potential energy surfaces

 - **Abstract**
 CH$_3^+$, a cornerstone intermediate in interstellar chemistry, has recently been detected for the first time by the James Webb Space Telescope. The photodissociation of this ion is studied here. Accurate explicitly correlated multi-reference configuration interaction {\it ab initio} calculations are done, and full dimensional potential energy surfaces are developed for the three lower electronic states, with a fundamental invariant neural network method. The photodissociation cross section is calculated using a full dimensional quantum wave packet method, in heliocentric Radau coordinates. The wave packet is represented in angular and radial grids allowing to reduce the number of points physically accessible, requiring to push up the spurious states appearing when evaluating the angular kinetic terms, through a projection technique. The photodissociation spectra, when employed in astrochemical models to simulate the conditions of the Orion Bar, results in a lesser destruction of CH$_3^+$ compared to that obtained when utilizing the recommended values in the kinetic database for astrochemistry (KIDA).

 - **Abstract**
 Continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) from various astrophysical sources are one of the many future probes of upcoming Gravitational Wave (GW) search missions. Neutron stars (NSs) with deformity are one of the leading sources of CGW emissions. In this work, for the first time, a novel attempt to estimate the dark matter (DM) capture rate is performed using CGW as the probe to the local NS population. Competitive bounds on DM capture from the local NS population are reported when compared with DM direct search experiments and other astrophysical observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe recent spectroscopic observations of red giant stars made by the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument on board the Hubble Space Telescope, which have provided spatially resolved observations of the warm chromospheric winds that predominate for early K to mid-M giants. The H I Lyman-alpha lines of a set of 11 red giants observed with the STIS/E140M echelle grating are first analyzed to ascertain wind H I column densities and total wind mass-loss rates. The M giants have estimated mass-loss rates of Mdot=(14-86)e-11 Msun/yr, while the K giants with detected wind absorption have weaker winds with Mdot=(1.5-2.8)e-11 Msun/yr. We use long-slit spectra of H I Lyman-alpha for two particular red giants, Alpha Tau (K5 III) and Gamma Cru (M3.5 III), to study the spatial extent of the Lyman-alpha emission. From these data we estimate limits for the extent of detectable emission, which are r=193 Rstar for Gamma Cru and r=44 Rstar for Alpha Tau. Cross-dispersion emission profiles in the STIS echelle spectra of the larger sample of red giants also show evidence for spatial resolution, not only for H I Lyman-alpha but for other lines with visible wind absorption, such as Fe II, Mg II, Mg I, O I, and C II. We characterize the nature of these spatial signatures. The spatial extent is far more apparent for the M giants than for the K giants, consistent with the stronger winds found for the M giants from the Lyman-alpha analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the simplest, and currently favoured, theoretical realizations of cosmic inflation yield a sharp prediction for the running of the spectral index $\alpha_\mathrm{S}$. Using latest cosmological data, we compute its marginalized posterior probability distribution over the space of nearly 300 models of single-field slow-roll inflation. The most probable value is $\alpha_\mathrm{S}=-6.3 \times 10^{-4}$, lying within the $98\%$ credible interval $-1.8 \times 10^{-3}< \alpha_\mathrm{S}< -9.1 \times 10^{-5}$. Within the landscape of all the proposed slow-roll inflationary models, positive values for the running are therefore disfavoured at more than three-sigma.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic ray (CR) knees (spectral steepenings) encode information on CR accelerator populations. We seek population features that imprint onto knee observables in a manner that is robust enough to be discernible even in the presence of significant systematics in CR data. In particular, we explore how diversity among population members could imprint on the knee phenomenology, under the assumption that a knee is due to a fixed-rigidity cutoff in the source spectra. We use a simple theoretical model for a population of CR accelerators. Each population member accelerates CR to a power-law spectrum, up to a cutoff rigidity. We allow for variance among members, in cutoff rigidity and power-law slope. We find that: (a) the slope step of the spectrum is $\sim 0.5$, decreasing weakly with increasing spread in either property; (b) composition always breaks first; (c) the difference between the break energies in composition and flux increases with increasing diversity; (d) composition and flux break together only if population diversity is minimal. These trends are robust under our assumptions; deviations from them would indicate more complex physics than encoded in our simple model. Comparing these trends with observed CR knees, we conclude that: (i) the primary knee at $\sim 4\times10^{15}$ eV is consistent with a constant-rigidity cutoff according to KASCADE-Grande data processed with post-LHC hadronic models, but not according to other datasets; (ii) the second knee at $\sim 5 \times 10^{17}$ eV requires more complexity than our model; (iii) the spectral feature identified by Auger at $\sim 10^{19}$ eV is consistent with a constant-rigidity source cutoff only if there is a substantial spread in both cutoff rigidity and slope. Interestingly, a significant spread in slope would also result in spectral curvature before the break, which would in turn be contributing to the ankle feature.

 - **Abstract**
 The X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) is the high-resolution X-ray spectrometer to fly on board the Athena Space Observatory of the European Space Agency (ESA). It is being developed by an international Consortium led by France, involving twelve ESA member states, plus the United States. It is a cryogenic instrument, involving state of the art technology, such as micro-calorimeters, to be read out by low noise electronics. As the instrument was undergoing its system requirement review (in 2022), a life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed to estimate the environmental impacts associated with the development of the sub-systems that were under the responsibility of the X-IFU Consortium. The assessment included the supply, manufacturing and testing of sub systems, as well as involved logistics and manpower. We find that the most significant environmental impacts arise from testing activities, which is related to energy consumption in clean rooms, office work, which is related to energy consumption in office buildings, and instrument manufacturing, which is related to the use of mineral and metal resources. Furthermore, business travels is another area of concern, despite the policy to reduced flying adopted by the Consortium. As the instrument is now being redesigned to fit within the new boundaries set by ESA, the LCA will be updated, with a focus on the hot spots identified in the first iteration. The new configuration, consolidated in 2023, is significantly different from the previously studied version and is marked by an increase of the perimeter of responsibility for the Consortium. This will need to be folded in the updated LCA, keeping the ambition to reduce the environmental footprint of X-IFU, while complying with its stringent requirements in terms of performance and risk management.

 - **Abstract**
 The curvature in blazar spectrum has the potential to understand the particle dynamics in jets. We performed a detailed analysis of simultaneous Swift-XRT (0.3-10 keV) and NuSTAR (3-79 keV)} observations of Mkn 421. Our analysis of NuSTAR observations alone reveals that, during periods of low flux, the hard X-ray spectra are best represented by a steep power-law with photon index reaching $\sim$ 3. However, the spectrum exhibits significant curvature during its high flux states. To investigate this, we explore plausible diffusion processes facilitating shock acceleration in the emission region that can contribute to the observed spectral curvature. Particularly, such processes can cause gradual fall of the photon spectrum at high energies which can be represented by a sub-exponential function. The parameter that decides this spectral change can be used to characterise the energy dependence of the diffusive process. Our results suggest that the X-ray spectra of Mkn 421 are consistent with a scenario where particle acceleration is mediated through Bohm-type diffusion and the spectra beyond the synchrotron peak is modulated by the radiative loss process.

 - **Abstract**
 The Kepler mission enabled us to look at the intrinsic population of exoplanets within our galaxy. In period-radius space, the distribution of the intrinsic population of planets contains structure that can trace planet formation and evolution history. The most distinctive feature in period-radius space is the radius cliff, a steep drop-off in occurrence between $2.5-4$R$_\oplus$ across all period ranges, separating the sub-Neptune population from the rarer Neptunes orbiting within 1 au. Following our earlier work to measure the occurrence rate of the Kepler population, we characterize the shape of the radius cliff as a function of orbital period ($10-300$ days) as well as insolation flux (9500S$_\oplus$ -- 10S$_\oplus$). The shape of the cliff flattens at longer orbital periods, tracking the rising population of Neptune-sized planets. In insolation, however, the radius cliff is both less dramatic and the slope is more uniform. The difference in this feature between period- and insolation-space can be linked to the effect of EUV/X-ray versus bolometric flux in the planet's evolution. Models of atmospheric mass loss processes that predict the location and shape of the radius valley also predict the radius cliff. We compare our measured occurrence rate distribution to population synthesis models of photoevaporation and core-powered mass-loss in order to constrain formation and evolution pathways. We find that the models do not statistically agree with our occurrence distributions of the radius cliff in period- or insolation-space. Atmospheric mass loss that shapes the radius valley cannot fully explain the shape of the radius cliff.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroids with low orbital perihelion distances experience extreme heating from the Sun that can modify their surfaces and trigger non-typical activity mechanisms. These objects are generally difficult to observe from ground-based telescopes due to their frequent proximity to the Sun. The Near Earth Object Surveyor mission, however, will regularly survey down to Solar elongations of 45 degrees and is well-suited for the detection and characterization of low-perihelion asteroids. Here, we use the survey simulation software tools developed for mission verification to explore the expected sensitivity of NEO Surveyor to these objects. We find that NEO Surveyor is expected to be >90% complete for near-Sun objects larger than D~300 m. Additionally, if the asteroid (3200) Phaethon underwent a disruption event in the past to form the Geminid meteor stream, Surveyor will be >90% complete to any fragments larger than D~200 m. For probable disruption models, NEO Surveyor would be expected to detect dozens of objects on Phaethon-like orbits, compared to a predicted background population of only a handful of asteroids, setting strong constraints on the likelihood of this scenario.
#### Dark Radiation with Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from DESI 2024 and the  $H_0$ tension

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the presence of extra relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe, contributing to the effective number of neutrinos $N_\text{eff}$, as $\Delta N_\text{eff}\equiv N_\text{eff}-3.044\geq 0$, in light of the recent measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) by the DESI collaboration. We analyze one-parameter extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM model where dark radiation (DR) is free streaming or behaves as a perfect fluid, due to self-interactions. We report a significant relaxation of upper bounds on $\Delta N_\text{eff}$, with respect to previous BAO data from SDSS+6dFGS, when additionally employing Planck data (and supernovae data from Pantheon+), setting $\Delta N_\text{eff}\leq 0.39$ ($95\%$ C.L.) for free streaming DR, and a very mild preference for fluid DR, $\Delta N_\text{eff} = 0.221^{+0.088}_{-0.18}$ ($\leq 0.46$, $95\%$ C.L.). Applying constraints from primordial element abundances leads to slightly tighter constraints on $\Delta N_\text{eff}$, but they are avoided if DR is produced after Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). For fluid DR we estimate the tension with the SH$_0$ES determination of $H_0$ to be around $(2.3-2.8)\sigma$ level, and for free-streaming DR the tension is below $3\sigma$ if production occurs after BBN. This lesser degree of tension motivates a combination with SH$_0$ES in these cases, resulting in a $4.4\sigma-5\sigma$ evidence for dark radiation with $\Delta N_\text{eff}\simeq 0.6$ and large improvements in $\chi^2$ over $\Lambda$CDM, $-18\lesssim \Delta \chi^2\lesssim -25$.
