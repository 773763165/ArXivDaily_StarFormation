#### Title:
          Capturing the short-term characteristics of a barred galaxy from a single snapshot

 - **Abstract**
 Using a dataset of stars from a barred galaxy that provides instantaneous positions and velocities in the sky, we propose a method to identify its key structures, such as the central bar and spiral arms, and to determine the bar pattern speed in the short term. This is accomplished by applying combinatorial and topological data analysis techniques to the available star-state information set. To validate the methodology, we apply it to two scenarios: a test particle simulation and a N-body simulation, both evaluated when the bar is fully formed. In both cases, the results are robust and consistent. We then use these outcomes to calibrate a classical dynamical model and compute related structures, such as equilibrium points and invariant manifolds, which we verify align with the galaxy's spiral arms.

          An Alcock-Paczynski Test on Reionization Bubbles for Cosmology

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we propose an Alcock-Paczyński (AP) test to constrain cosmology using HII bubbles during the Epoch of Reionization. Similarly to cosmic voids, a stack of HII bubbles is spherically symmetric because ionizing fronts propagate isotropically on average (even if individual bubbles may not be spherical), making them standard spheres to be used in an AP test. Upcoming 21-cm observations, from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) for instance, will contain tomographic information about HII regions during reionization. However, extracting the bubbles from this signal is made difficult because of instrumental noise and foreground systematics. Here, we use a neural network to reconstruct neutral-fraction boxes from the noisy 21-cm signal, from which we extract bubbles using a watershed algorithm. We then run the purely geometrical AP test on these stacks, showing that a SKA-like experiment will be able to constrain the product of the angular-diameter distance $D_{\text{A}}$ and Hubble parameter $H$ at reionization redshifts with $\sim 2\%$ precision, robustly to astrophysical and cosmological uncertainties within the models tested here. This AP test, whether performed on 21-cm observations or other large surveys of ionized bubbles, will allow us to fill the knowledge gap about the expansion rate of our Universe at reionization redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 Rapidly rotating classical OBe stars have been proposed as the products of binary interactions, and the fraction of Be stars with compact companions implies that at least some are. However, to constrain the interaction physics spinning up the OBe stars, a large sample of homogeneously analysed OBe stars with well-determined binary characteristics and orbital parameters are required. We investigate the multiplicity properties of a sample of 18 Oe, 62 Be, and two Of?p stars observed within the BLOeM survey in the Small Magellanic Cloud. We analyse the first nine epochs of spectroscopic observations obtained over approximately three months in 2023. Radial velocities (RVs) of all stars are measured. Applying commonly-used binarity criteria we classify objects as binaries, binary candidates, and apparently single (RV stable) objects. We further inspect the spectra for double-lined spectroscopic binaries and cross-match with catalogues of X-ray sources and photometric binaries. We classify 14 OBe stars as binaries, and an additional 11 as binary candidates. The two Of?p stars are apparently single. Two more objects are most likely currently interacting binaries. Without those, the observed binary fraction for the OBe sample (78 stars) is f_OBe_obs=0.18+/-0.04 (f_obs_cand=0.32+/-0.05 including candidates). This fraction is less than half of that measured for OB stars in BLOeM. Combined with the lower fraction of SB2s, this suggests that OBe stars have indeed fundamentally different binary properties than OB stars. We find no evidence for OBe binaries with massive compact companions, in contrast to expectations from binary population synthesis. Our results support the binary scenario as an important formation channel for OBe stars, as post-interaction binaries may have been disrupted or the stripped companions of OBe stars are harder to detect.

 - **Abstract**
 Radial migration is an important dynamical effect that has reshaped the Galactic disc, but its origin has yet to be elucidated. In this work, we present evidence that resonant dragging by the corotation of a decelerating bar could be the main driver of radial migration in the Milky Way disc. Using a test particle simulation, we demonstrate this scenario explains the two distinct age-metallicity sequences observed in the solar vicinity: the plateauing upper sequence is interpreted as stars dragged outwards by the expanding corotation of the decelerating bar and the steeper lower sequence as stars formed locally around the solar circle. The upper migrated sequence dominates at guiding radii around the current corotation radius of the bar, $R\sim7\,\mathrm{kpc}$, but rapidly dies away beyond this where the mechanism cannot operate. This behaviour naturally explains the radial dependence of the $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$-bimodality, in particular the truncation of the high-$\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ disc beyond the solar circle. Under our proposed radial migration scenario, we constrain the Milky Way bar's pattern speed evolution using the age-metallicity distribution of stars currently trapped at corotation. We find the bar likely formed with an initial pattern speed of $60-100$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ and began decelerating $6-8$ Gyr ago at a rate $-\dot{\Omega}/\Omega^2\sim0.0025-0.0040$ (where the quoted ranges include systematic uncertainties).

          Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): The multiplicity properties and evolution of BAF-type supergiants

 - **Abstract**
 Given the uncertain evolutionary status of blue supergiant stars, their multiplicity properties hold vital clues to better understand their origin and evolution. As part of The Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM) campaign in the Small Magellanic Cloud we present a multi-epoch spectroscopic survey of 128 supergiant stars of spectral type B5--F5, which roughly correspond to initial masses in the range 6 to 30 solar masses. The observed binary fraction for the B5-9 supergiants is 25+/-6 % (10+/-4 %) and 5+/-2 % (0 %) for the A-F stars, using a radial velocity (RV) variability threshold of 5 kms (10 kms) as a criterion for binarity. Accounting for observational biases we find an intrinsic multiplicity fraction of less than 18% for the B5-9 stars and 8$^{+9}_{-7}$% for the AF stars, for the orbital periods up to 10$^{3.5}$day and mass-ratios (q) in the range 0.1 < q < 1. The large stellar radii of these supergiant stars prevent short orbital periods but we demonstrate that this effect alone cannot explain our results. We assess the spectra and RV time series of the detected binary systems and find that only a small fraction display convincing solutions. We conclude that the multiplicity fractions are compromised by intrinsic stellar variability such that the true multiplicity fraction may be significantly smaller. Our main conclusions from comparing the multiplicity properties of the B5-9 and AF supergiants to that of their less evolved counterparts is that such stars cannot be explained by a direct evolution from the main sequence. Furthermore, by comparing their multiplicity properties to red supergiant stars we conclude that the AF supergiant stars are neither progenitors nor descendants of red supergiants.

 - **Abstract**
 Runaway stars with peculiar high velocities can generate stellar bow shocks. Only a few bow shocks show clear radio emission. Our goal is to identify and characterize new stellar bow shocks around O and Be runaway stars in the infrared (IR), and to study their possible radio emission and nature. Our input data is a catalog of O and Be runaways compiled using Gaia DR3. We used WISE IR images to search for bow shocks around these runaways, Gaia DR3 data to determine the actual motion of the runaway stars corrected for interstellar medium (ISM) motion caused by Galactic rotation, and archival radio data to search for emission signatures. We finally explored the radio detectability of these sources under thermal and nonthermal scenarios. We found 9 new stellar bow shock candidates, 3 new bubble candidates, and 1 intermediate structure candidate. One of them is an in situ bow shock candidate. We also found 17 already known bow shocks in our sample, though we discarded one, and 62 miscellaneous sources showing some IR emission around the runaways. We geometrically characterized the sources in IR using the WISE-4 band and estimated the ISM density at the bow shock positions, obtaining median values of ~6 and ~4 cm$^{-3}$ using 2D and 3D peculiar velocities. Most of the new discovered bow shocks come from new runaway discoveries. Within our samples we found that ~24% of the O-type runaway stars show bow shocks, while this decreases to ~3% for Be-type runaway stars. Two bow shocks present radio emission but not as clear counterparts, and two others show hints of radio emission. The physical scenarios indicate that two sources could still be compatible with nonthermal radio emission. The new sample of O and Be runaway stars allowed us to discover both new stellar bow shocks and bubbles. Their geometrical characterization can be used to assess the physical scenario of the radio emission. (Abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 Many astrophysical explosions, such as type Ia supernovae, classical novae, and X-ray bursts, are dominated by thermonuclear runaway. To model these processes accurately, one must evolve nuclear reactions concurrently with hydrodynamics. We present an application of the moving mesh technique to this field of computation with the aim of explicitly testing the advantages of the method against the fixed mesh case. By way of traditional Strang splitting, our work couples a 13 isotope nuclear reaction network to a 1D moving mesh, Cartesian geometry hydrodynamics code. We explore three reacting problems: an acoustic pulse, a burning shock, and an advecting deflagration. Additionally using the shock jump conditions, we semi-analytically solve the burning shock problem under the assumption of quick, complete burning with the hope of establishing a useful and easy to set-up test problem. Strong moving mesh advantages are found in advecting, deflagrating flame fronts, where the technique dramatically reduces numerical diffusion that would otherwise lead to very fast artificial deflagration.

 - **Abstract**
 Foundational models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in deep learning field, leveraging their capacity to learn robust representations from large-scale datasets and effectively to diverse downstream applications such as classification. In this paper, we present Astromer 2 a foundational model specifically designed for extracting light curve embeddings. We introduce Astromer 2 as an enhanced iteration of our self-supervised model for light curve analysis. This paper highlights the advantages of its pre-trained embeddings, compares its performance with that of its predecessor, Astromer 1, and provides a detailed empirical analysis of its capabilities, offering deeper insights into the model's representations. Astromer 2 is pretrained on 1.5 million single-band light curves from the MACHO survey using a self-supervised learning task that predicts randomly masked observations within sequences. Fine-tuning on a smaller labeled dataset allows us to assess its performance in classification tasks. The quality of the embeddings is measured by the F1 score of an MLP classifier trained on Astromer-generated embeddings. Our results demonstrate that Astromer 2 significantly outperforms Astromer 1 across all evaluated scenarios, including limited datasets of 20, 100, and 500 samples per class. The use of weighted per-sample embeddings, which integrate intermediate representations from Astromer's attention blocks, is particularly impactful. Notably, Astromer 2 achieves a 15% improvement in F1 score on the ATLAS dataset compared to prior models, showcasing robust generalization to new datasets. This enhanced performance, especially with minimal labeled data, underscores the potential of Astromer 2 for more efficient and scalable light curve analysis.

          Lunar Laser Ranging with High-Power CW Lasers

 - **Abstract**
 We present a high-power continuous-wave (CW) lunar laser ranging (LLR) technique that has the potential to significantly improve Earth--Moon distance measurements. Using a 1 kW CW laser at 1064 nm and a 1 m-aperture telescope as an example, we develop a detailed link budget and analyze the prevailing noise sources to assess system performance when ranging to next-generation ~10 cm corner-cube retroreflectors (CCRs). Unlike legacy arrays, these smaller CCRs are designed to yield lower intrinsic range errors, yet their reduced reflective area results in lower photon return rates, posing challenges for pulsed LLR systems. The photon-rich CW approach, by providing continuous high-power illumination, overcomes this limitation, reducing shot noise and enabling sustained millimeter-level ranging with a pathway to sub-0.1 mm precision. Furthermore, by alternating measurements between widely separated lunar reflectors, differential LLR mitigates common-mode station errors to achieve tens-of-micrometer precision, limited primarily by uncorrelated atmospheric turbulence. This scalable approach -- integrating high-power CW lasers, narrowband filtering, and rapid atmospheric turbulence averaging -- enables next-generation gravitational tests, precision lunar geodesy, and improved lunar reference frames in support of planetary exploration.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Multiple systems are common in field stars, and the frequency is found to be higher in early evolutionary stages. Thus, the study of young multiple systems during the embedded stages is key to have a comprehensive understanding of star formation. In particular, how material accretes from the large-scale envelope into the inner region and how this flow interacts with the system physically and chemically has not yet been well characterized observationally. Aims. We aim to provide a snapshot of the forming protobinary system SVS13A, consisting of VLA4A and VLA4B. This includes clear pictures of its kinematic structures, physical conditions, and chemical properties. Methods. We conducted ALMA observations toward SVS13A targeting CH3CN and CH3-13CN J=12-11 K-ladder line emission with a high spatial resolution of ~30 au at a spectral resolution of ~0.08 km s-1 Results. We perform LTE radiative transfer models to fit the spectral features of the line emission. We find the two-layer LTE radiative model including dust absorption is essential to interpret the CH3CN and CH3-13-CN line emission. We identify two major and four small kinematic components, and derive their physical and chemical properties. Conclusions. We find a possible infalling signature toward the bursting secondary source VLA4A, which may be fed by an infalling streamer from the large-scale envelope. The mechanical heating in the binary system, as well as the infalling shocked gas, likely play a role in the thermal structure of the protobinary system. By accumulating mass from the streamer, the system might have experienced a gravitationally unstable phase before the accretion outburst. Finally, the derived CH3CN/CH3-13-CN ratio is lower than the canonical ratio in the ISM and is different between VLA4A and VLA4B.

 - **Abstract**
 We detail the use of the University of Tasmania's (UTAS) optical and radio telescopes to conduct observations of near-Earth asteroids from 2021 to 2024. The Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex transmitted a radio signal at 7159.45 MHz, with the radar echo detected by the UTAS radio telescopes. The method of accounting for the Doppler shift between the stations and the near-Earth object is described so that others can implement a similar program. We present our results, with confirmed detections of 1994 PC1 and 2003 UC20 asteroids using the Hobart and Katherine 12-m antennas, demonstrating the feasibility of using small radio telescopes for these observations. Additionally, the recently upgraded Ceduna 30 m antenna was used to detect 2024 MK. Data collected from other observatories, such as Tidbinbilla, as well as the UTAS radar tracking of the moon are also presented in the context of demonstrating the means of applying these Doppler corrections and the accuracy of each method. Optical observations conducted in this period are also detailed as they complement radar observations and aid in refining the orbit parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 New concepts for observing the gravitational waves (GWs) using a detector on the Moon, such as the Lunar Gravitational-wave Antenna (LGWA), have gained increasing attention. By utilizing the Moon as a giant antenna, the LGWA is expected to detect GWs in the frequency range from 1 millihertz (mHz) to several hertz, with optimal sensitivity in the decihertz band. Despite the debated formation and evolution channel of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with masses in the range of $[10^2, 10^5]\ {\rm M_\odot}$, binary systems containing at least one IMBH are widely believed to generate GWs spanning from mHz to a few Hz, making them a key scientific target for the LGWA. We explore the detectability of IMBH binaries with the LGWA in this work. The LGWA is more sensitive to nearby binaries (i.e. with redshift $z\lesssim0.5$) with the primary mass $m_1 \in [10^4, 10^5] \ {\rm M_\odot}$, while it prefers distant binaries (i.e. $z \gtrsim 5$) with $m_1 \in [10^3, 10^4] \ {\rm M_\odot}$. Considering a signal-to-noise ratio threshold of 10, our results imply that the LGWA can detect IMBH binaries up to $z \sim \mathcal{O}(10)$. We further show that the LGWA can constrain the primary mass with relative errors $\lesssim 0.1\%$ for binaries at $z \lesssim 0.5$. Furthermore, we show that the IMBH binaries at $z \lesssim 0.1$ can be used to constrain redshift with relative errors $\lesssim 10\%$, and those with $m_1 \in [10^4, 10^5] \ {\rm M_\odot}$ can be localized by the LGWA to be within $\mathcal{O} (10)$ $\rm deg^2$.

 - **Abstract**
 The pulsar wind nebula CTB 87 (G74.9+1.2) is one of the sources emitting $\gamma$-rays with energies higher than 10 TeV, as measured by the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System telescope (VERITAS). In this study, we undertake a reanalysis of the GeV emission from the CTB 87 region, utilising $\sim$16 years of high-energy $\gamma$-ray data collected with the Fermi Large Area Telescope. In the energy range of 0.03--1 TeV, the spectrum can be adequately described by a power-law model with an index of 1.34 $\pm$ 0.18, and the integral energy flux is calculated to be (7.25 $\pm$ 1.36) $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Based on the multiband data, we have employed a time-dependent model to investigate the non-thermal emission properties of CTB 87. In the model, it is assumed that particles with broken power-law energy distributions are continuously injected into the nebula. This results in multiband non-thermal emission being produced by relativistic leptons via synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton processes. Furthermore, the model suggests an energy of approximately 2.4 PeV for the most energetic particle in the nebula.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of the kinematics of SiO maser stars around the center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). We used the archive data in the SiO v=1, J=2-1 emission line obtained by the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in 2017 and 2021 (#2016.1.00940.S, PI Darling, J. and #2019.1.00292.S, PI Paine, J.). We detected 37 SiO maser stars in the channel maps and derived their angular offsets relative to Sgr A* and LSR radial velocities. We derived the proper motions of 35 stars by comparing their angular offsets in the two epochs. The proper motions of Wolf-Rayet and O star in the Nuclear Star Cluster (NSC) are reported to be rather random, except for the co-moving clusters IRS13E and IRS13N (Tsuboi et al. 2022). However, the derived proper motions of SiO maser stars do not look completely random. The proper motions of the SiO maser stars show a tendency to lie along the Galactic plane. The proper motion amplitudes of SiO maser stars are larger than the LSR velocity amplitudes. We estimated the 3D motions from the proper motions and LSR velocities. Many 3D velocities are near to or larger than the upper limit velocities for Kepler orbits around Sgr A*, whose mass is assumed to be 4x10^6 Msun. These indicate that the SiO maser stars around Sgr A* are members of the Nuclear Stellar Disk rather than the NSC.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole images obtained by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) by the Event Horizon Telescope are a new tool for testing general relativity in super-strong gravitational fields. These images demonstrated a ring-like structure which can be explained as the black hole shadow image. To date, there are no reliable methods for determining the parameters of these ring-like structures, such as diameter, width, and asymmetry. In this paper, an algorithm for determining black hole image parameters is proposed using a Gaussian asymmetric ring as an example. Using the proposed method, the diameter and asymmetry parameters of the image of a supermassive black hole in the galaxy M87$^{*}$ were estimated based on observational data obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope group.

 - **Abstract**
 Cyanopolyynes are among the largest and most commonly observed interstellar Complex Organic Molecules in star-forming regions. They are believed to form primarily in the gas-phase, but their formation routes are not well understood. We present a comprehensive study of the gas-phase formation network of cyanobutadiyne, HC$_5$N, based on new theoretical calculations, kinetics experiments, astronomical observations, and astrochemical modeling. We performed new quantum mechanics calculations for six neutral-neutral reactions in order to derive reliable rate coefficients and product branching fractions. We also present new CRESU data on the rate coefficients of three of these reactions (C$_3$N + C$_2$H$_2$, C$_2$H + HC$_3$N, CN + C$_4$H$_2$) obtained at temperatures as low as 24 K. In practice, six out of nine reactions currently used in astrochemical models have been updated in our reviewed network. We also report the tentative detection of the $^{13}$C isotopologues of HC$_5$N in the L1544 prestellar core. We derived a lower limit of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C > 75 for the HC$_5$N isotopologues, which does not allow to bring new constraints to the HC$_5$N chemistry. Finally, we verified the impact of the revised reactions by running the GRETOBAPE astrochemical model. We found good agreement between the HC$_5$N predicted and observed abundances in cold ($\sim$10 K) objects, demonstrating that HC$_5$N is mainly formed by neutral-neutral reactions in these environments. In warm molecular shocks, instead, the predicted abundances are a factor of ten lower with respect to observed ones. In this environment possessing an higher gas ionization fraction, we speculate that the contribution of ion-neutral reactions could be significant.

 The collision outcomes of dust aggregates in protoplanetary disks dictate how planetesimals form. Experimental and numerical studies have suggested that bouncing collisions occurring at low impact velocities may limit aggregate growth in the disks, but the conditions under which bouncing occurs have yet to be fully understood. In this study, we perform a suite of collision simulations of moderately compact dust aggregates with various impact velocities, aggregate radii, and filling factors ranging between 0.4 and 0.5. Unlike previous simulations, we generate compact aggregates by compressing more porous ones, mimicking the natural processes through which compact aggregates form. We find that the compressed aggregates bounce above a threshold mass, which decreases with impact velocity. The threshold mass scales with impact velocity as the $-4/3$ power, consistent with the findings of previous experiments. We also find that the threshold aggregate mass for bouncing depends strongly on filling factor, likely reflecting the strong filling-factor dependence of the compressive strength of compressed aggregates. Our energy analysis reveals that nearly 90\% of the initial impact energy is dissipated during the initial compression phase, and over 70\% of the remaining energy is dissipated during the subsequent stretching phase, regardless of whether the collision results in sticking or bouncing. Our results indicate that dust aggregates with a filling factor of 0.4 cease to grow beyond 100 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ as a result of the bouncing barrier.

 - **Abstract**
 1LHAASO J0249+6022 is an extended very-high-energy gamma-ray source discovered by the Large High-Altitude Air Shower Observatory. Based on nearly 16.1 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope, we report the probable gamma-ray emission from 1LHAASO J0249+6022 in the 0.03-1 TeV energy range. The results show that its gamma-ray spectrum can be well fitted by a single power law with an index of 1.54 $\pm$ 0.17, and integral photon flux is (4.28 $\pm$ 1.03) $\times$ 10$^{-11}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. We also considered theoretically whether the non-thermal emission could originate from a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) scenario. Assuming that the particles injected into the nebula have a power-law distribution, the resulting spectrum from the inverse Compton scattering is consistent with the detected GeV and TeV gamma-ray fluxes. Our study shows that the PWN scenario is reasonable for 1LHAASO J0249+6022.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent work with JWST has demonstrated its capability to identify and chemically characterize multiple populations in globular clusters down to the H-burning limit. In this study, we explore the kinematics of multiple populations in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae by combining data from JWST, HST, and Gaia. We analyzed velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles from the cluster center out to $\sim$10$R_h$. Our findings indicate that while 1G stars are isotropic, 2G stars are significantly radially anisotropic. These results align with the predictions of simulations of the dynamical evolution of clusters where 2G stars are initially more centrally concentrated than 1G stars. Furthermore, we subdivided the 2G population into two subpopulations: $2G_A$ and $2G_B$, with the latter being more chemically extreme. We compared their dynamical profiles and found no significant differences. For the first time, we measured the degree of energy equipartition among the multiple populations of 47 Tucanae. Overall, within the analyzed radial range ($\sim$2-4$R_h$), both populations exhibit a low degree of energy equipartition. The most significant differences between 1G and 2G stars are observed in the tangential velocity component, where 2G stars are characterized by a stronger degree of energy equipartition than 1G stars. In the radial component, the behavior of 1G and 2G stars is more variable, with differences largely dependent on radius. Finally, our analysis reveals that the ratio of rotational velocity to velocity dispersion is larger for the 2G population, while 1G stars exhibit higher skewness in their tangential proper motions, providing further evidence of differences in the kinematic properties of the 1G and 2G populations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present \texttt{SACRA-2D}, a new MPI and OpenMP parallelized, fully relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) code in dynamical spacetime under axial symmetry with the cartoon method using the finite-volume shock-capturing schemes for hydrodynamics. Specifically, we implemented the state-of-the-art HLLC Riemann solver and found better accuracy than the standard Total Variation Diminishing Lax-Friedrich Riemann solver. The spacetime evolves under the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura formalism with Z4c constraint propagation. We demonstrate the accuracy of the code with some benchmark tests and excellent agreement with other codes in the literature. A wide variety of test simulations, including the head-on collision of black holes, the migration and collapse of neutron stars, and the collapse of a rotating supermassive star to a massive black hole and a disk, is also performed to show the robustness of our new code.

          Configuration of Single Giant Planet Systems Generating `Oumuamua-Like Interstellar Asteroids

 - **Abstract**
 The first discovered interstellar small object, `Oumuamua (1I/2017 U1), presents unique physical properties of extremely elongated geometric shape and dual characteristics of an asteroid and a comet. These properties suggest a possible origin through tidal fragmentation, which posits that `Oumuamua was produced through intensive tidal fragmentation during a close encounter with a star or a white dwarf, resulting in its shape and ejection from its natal system. According to this mechanism, a high initial orbit eccentricity and a small pericentre of the parent body are necessary to produce `Oumuamua-like objects. To verify whether this mechanism can occur in single giant planet systems, we conduct long-term numerical simulations of systems with a low-mass ($0.5M_\odot$) host star and a giant planet in this study. We determine that an eccentric orbit ($e_\mathrm{p}\sim0.2$) and a Jupiter-mass ($M_\mathrm{p}\sim M_\mathrm{J}$) of the planet appears to be optimal to generate sufficient perturbations for the production of `Oumuamua-like objects. When the planetary semi-major axis $a_\mathrm{p}$ increases, the proportion of planetesimals ejected beyond the system $P(\mathrm{ej})$ increases accordingly, while the possibilities of ejected planetesimals undergoing stellar tidal fragmentation $P(\mathrm{tidal}|\mathrm{ej})$ remains relatively constant at $\sim0.6\%$. Focusing on stellar tidal fragmentation alone, the ratio of extremely elongated interstellar objects to all interstellar objects is $P_\mathrm{e}\sim3\%$.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark Scattering (DS) is an interacting dark energy model characterised by pure momentum exchange between dark energy and dark matter. It is phenomenologically interesting because it is unconstrained by CMB data and can alleviate the $S_8$ tension. We derive constraints on cosmological and DS parameters using three two-point correlation functions (3$\times$2pt) from the Dark Energy Survey third year data release (DES Y3). We then add information from the multipoles of the galaxy power spectrum combined with Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements using the twelfth data release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS DR12) and external BAO measurements. We compare results from the direct combination of the probes with the joint posterior distribution calculated with a normalising flow approach. Additionally, we run a CMB analysis with the Planck Public Release 4 (PR4) for comparison of the cosmological constraints. Overall, we find that the combination of probes allows minimising the projection effects and improves constraints without the need to include CMB information. It brings the marginalised posterior maxima closer to the corresponding best-fit values and weakens the sensitivity to the priors of the spectroscopic modelling nuisance parameters. These findings are highly relevant in light of forthcoming data of surveys like DESI, Euclid, and Rubin.

 - **Abstract**
 The brightest ever observed gamma ray burst GRB 221009A at redshift $z = 0.151$ was detected on October 9, 2022. Its highest energy photons have been recorded by the LHAASO collaboration up to above $12 \, \rm TeV$, and one of the at ${\cal E} = 251 \, \rm TeV$ by the Carpet-2 collaboration. Very recently, the Carpet-3 collaboration has completed the data analysis, showing that the evidence of the $251 \, {\rm TeV}$ photon is quite robust. Still, according to conventional physics photons with ${\cal E} \gtrsim 10 \, \rm TeV$ cannot be observed owing to the absorption by the extragalactic background light (EBL). Previously it has been demonstrated that an axion-like particle (ALP) with allowed parameters ensures the observability of the LHAASO photons. Here we show that the Lorentz invariance violation allows the ${\cal E} = 251 \, {\rm TeV}$ (now around 300 TeV) Carpet photon to be detected.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Strong Lens Foundry. We discovered $\sim 3500$ new strong gravitational lens candidates in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys using residual neural networks (ResNet). We observed a subset (51) of our candidates using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). All of them were confirmed to be strong lenses. We also briefly describe spectroscopic follow-up observations by DESI and Keck NIRES programs. From this very rich dataset, a number of studies will be carried out, including evaluating the quality of the ResNet search candidates and lens modeling. In this paper we present our initial effort in these directions. In particular, as a demonstration, we present the lens model for DESI-165.4754-06.0423, with imaging data from HST, and lens and source redshifts from DESI and Keck NIRES, respectively. We use a fast, fully forward-modeling Bayesian pipeline, GIGA-Lens. This is the first time a strong lens with HST data, or any high resolution imaging, has been modeled using GPUs.

          Clustering of the extrema: A theoretical description of weak lensing critical points power spectra in the mildly nonlinear regime

 - **Abstract**
 In cosmic web analysis, complementary to traditional cosmological probes, the extrema (e.g. peaks and voids) two-point correlation functions (2PCFs) are of particular interest for the study of both astrophysical phenomena and cosmological structure formation. However most previous studies constructed those statistics via N-body simulations without a robust theoretical derivation from first principles. A strong motivation exists for analytically describing the 2PCFs of these local extrema, taking into account the nonlinear gravitational evolution in the late Universe. In this paper, we derive analytical formulae for the power spectra and 2PCFs of 2D critical points, including peaks (maxima), voids (minima) and saddle points, in mildly non-Gaussian weak gravitational lensing fields. We apply a perturbative bias expansion to model the clustering of 2D critical points. We successfully derive the power spectrum of weak lensing critical points up to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in gravitational perturbation theory, where trispectrum configurations of the weak lensing field have to be included. We numerically evaluate those power spectra up to the next-to-leading order (NLO), which correspond to the inclusion of bispectrum configurations, and transform them to the corresponding 2PCFs. An exact Monte Carlo (MC) integration is performed assuming a Gaussian distributed density field to validate our theoretical predictions. Overall, we find similar properties in 2D compared to the clustering of 3D critical points previously measured from N-body simulations. Contrary to standard lensing power spectra analysis, we find distinct BAO features in the lensing peak 2PCFs due to the gradient and curvature constraints, and we quantify that non-Gaussianity makes for ~10% of the signal at quasi-linear scales which could be important for current stage-IV surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves from merging binary neutron stars carry characteristic information about their astrophysical properties, including masses and tidal deformabilities, that are needed to infer their radii. In this study, we use Bayesian inference to quantify the precision with which radius can inferred with upgrades in the current gravitational wave detectors and next-generation observatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We assign evidences for a set of plausible equations of state, which are then used as weights to obtain radius posteriors. We find that prior choices and the loudness of observed signals limit the precision and accuracy of inferred radii by current detectors. In contrast, next-generation observatories can resolve the radius precisely and accurately, across most of the mass range to within $\lesssim 5\%$ for both soft and stiff equations of state. We also explore how the choice of the neutron star mass prior can influence the inferred masses and potentially affect radii measurements, finding that choosing an astrophysically motivated prior does not notably impact an individual neutron star's radius measurements.
