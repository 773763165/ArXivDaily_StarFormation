          Exploring generalized Starobinsky Model of Inflation: Observational Constraints

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the power-law Starobinsky model, a generalized version of the Starobinsky inflation model, characterized by a power-law correction to Einstein gravity. Employing the $f(R)$ formalism, the scalar and tensor power spectra were numerically computed as functions of the dimensionless parameters $M$ and $\beta$. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis was conducted using Planck-2018, BICEP3 and BAO observational data, yielding precise constraints on $\beta = 1.987^{+0.013}_{-0.016},\, 95\%\, C.\, L.$. and $ \log_{10}M = -4.72^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$. The derived scalar spectral index $n_s=0.9676^{+0.0069}_{-0.0068}$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r=0.0074^{+0.0061}_{-0.0044}$ lie within the bounds set by Planck observations. We analyse a general reheating scenario while keeping the number of e-folds during inflation, $N_{pivot}$, fixed. The analysis confirms that deviations from the Starobinsky $R^2$ model are observationaly viable, with implications for high-energy physics and supergravity-based inflationary models.

 - **Abstract**
 The Page time marks the moment when the von Neumann entropy of the emitted Hawking radiation equals the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of an evaporating black hole, which is assumed to quantify its degrees of freedom as seen from the outside. Beyond this point, from unitarity we would expect that the entropy of the radiation begins to decrease, ensuring that information is eventually recovered. In this work, we investigate the dependence of the Page time on black hole properties and the particle content of nature. Specifically, we analyze its sensitivity to the Standard Model (SM) and potential Beyond-the-SM degrees of freedom, incorporating the effects of particle masses. We find that a Schwarzschild primordial black hole (PBH) with an initial mass of $6.23\times 10^{14}~{\rm g}$ would have a Page time equal to the age of the Universe, assuming emission of SM particles only. We further explore the impact of a non-negligible PBH angular momentum, finding that light spin-2 particles are predominantly emitted before the Page time for Kerr black holes. For For initial angular momenta values exceeding $a_\star > 0.5$, approximately $70\%$ of the total graviton emission occurs prior to the Page time for PBHs with an initial mass $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{10}~{\rm g}$. Finally, we discuss the implications for PBH phenomenology, particularly regarding potential constraints from $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST's MIRI LRS provides the first opportunity to spectroscopically characterize the surface compositions of close-in terrestrial exoplanets. Models for the bare-rock spectra of these planets often utilize a spectral library from R. Hu et al., which is based on room temperature reflectance measurements of materials that represent archetypes of rocky planet surfaces. Here we present an expanded library that includes hemispherical reflectance measurements for a greater variety of compositions, varying textures (solid slab, coarsely crushed, and fine powder), as well as high temperature (500-800 K) emissivity measurements for select samples. We incorporate this new library into version 6.3 of the retrieval package PLATON and use it to show that surfaces with similar compositions can have widely varying albedos and surface temperatures. We additionally demonstrate that changing the texture of a material can significantly alter its albedo, making albedo a poor proxy for surface composition. We identify key spectral features -- the 5.6 \textmu{m} olivine feature, the transparency feature, the Si-O stretching feature, and the Christiansen feature -- that indicate silicate abundance and surface texture. We quantify the number of JWST observations needed to detect these features in the spectrum of the most favorable super-Earth target, LHS 3844 b, and revisit the interpretation of its Spitzer photometry. Lastly, we show that temperature-dependent changes in spectral features are likely undetectable at the precision of current exoplanet observations. Our results illustrate the importance of spectroscopically-resolved thermal emission measurements, as distinct from surface albedo constraints, for characterizing the surface compositions of hot, rocky exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 The primordial four-point function encodes a wealth of information about the inflationary Universe. Despite extensive theoretical work, most models of four-point physics have never been compared to data. In this series, we conduct a detailed analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization trispectra, searching for a wide variety of phenomena including local effects, self-interactions, curvatons, DBI inflation, gauge fields, solid inflation, scalar field exchange, spinning massive field exchange, chiral physics, point sources, and gravitational lensing. After presenting a suite of separable primordial templates, we derive thirteen quasi-optimal estimators that directly estimate the underlying template amplitudes. These are unbiased, minimum variance, mask-deconvolved, and account for correlations between templates (including with lensing). Each estimator can be efficiently implemented using spherical harmonic transforms, Monte Carlo methods, and optimization techniques, and asymptotes to standard forms in certain limits. In Paper 2, we implement these estimators in public code, and in Paper 3, use them to constrain primordial trispectra with Planck data. This enables a wide variety of tests of inflation, including some of the first direct constraints on cosmological collider physics.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the masses, sizes, and orbital properties of 86 planets orbiting 55 stars observed by NASA's K2 Mission with follow-up Doppler measurements by the HIRES spectrometer at the W. M. Keck Observatory and the Automated Planet Finder at Lick Observatory. Eighty-one of the planets were discovered from their transits in the K2 photometry, while five were found based on subsequent Doppler measurements of transiting planet host stars. The sizes of the transiting planets range from Earth-size to larger than Jupiter (1-3 REarth is typical), while the orbital periods range from less than a day to a few months. For 32 of the planets, the Doppler signal was detected with significance greater than 5-sigma (51 were detected with >3-sigma significance). An important characteristic of this catalog is the use of uniform analysis procedures to determine stellar and planetary properties. This includes the transit search and fitting procedures applied to the K2 photometry, the Doppler fitting techniques applied to the radial velocities, and the spectral modeling to determine bulk stellar parameters. Such a uniform treatment will make the catalog useful for statistical studies of the masses, densities, and system architectures of exoplanetary systems. This work also serves as a data release for all previously unpublished RVs and associated stellar activity indicators obtained by our team for these systems, along with derived stellar and planet parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 The Herschel open-time key program Disc Emission via a Bias-free Reconnaissance in the Infrared and Sub-millimeter (DEBRIS) is an unbiased survey of the nearest ~100 stars for each stellar type A-M observed with a uniform photometric sensitivity to search for cold debris disks around them. The analysis of the Photoconductor Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) photometric observations of the 94 DEBRIS M dwarfs of this program is presented in this paper, following upon two companion papers on the DEBRIS A-star and FGK-star subsamples. In the M-dwarf subsample, two debris disks have been detected, around the M3V dwarf GJ581 and the M4V dwarf FomalhautC (LP876-10). This result gives a disk detection rate of 2.1^{+2.7}_{-0.7}% at the 68% confidence level, significantly less than measured for earlier stellar types in the DEBRIS program. However, we show that the survey of the DEBRIS M-dwarf subsample is about ten times shallower than the surveys of the DEBRIS FGK subsamples when studied in the physical parameter space of the disk's fractional dust luminosity versus blackbody radius. Furthermore, had the DEBRIS K-star subsample been observed at the same shallower depth in this parameter space, its measured disk detection rate would have been statistically consistent with the one found for the M-dwarf subsample. Hence, the incidence of debris disks does not appear to drop from the K subsample to the M subsample of the DEBRIS program, when considering disks in the same region of physical parameter space. An alternative explanation is that the only two bright disks discovered in the M-dwarf subsample would not, in fact, be statistically representative of the whole population.

          KiDS-1000: Detection of deviations from a purely cold dark-matter power spectrum with tomographic weak gravitational lensing

 - **Abstract**
 Model uncertainties in the nonlinear structure growth limit current probes of cosmological parameters. To shed more light on the physics of nonlinear scales, we reconstruct the finely binned three-dimensional power-spectrum from lensing data of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), relying solely on the background cosmology, source redshift distributions, and the intrinsic alignment (IA) amplitude of sources (and their uncertainties). The adopted Tikhonov regularisation stabilises the deprojection, enabling a Bayesian reconstruction in separate $z$-bins. Following a detailed description of the algorithm and performance tests with mock data, we present our results for the power spectrum as relative deviations from a $\Lambda\rm CDM$ reference spectrum that includes only structure growth by cold dark matter. Averaged over the full range $z\lesssim1$, a \emph{Planck}-consistent reference then requires a significant suppression on nonlinear scales, $k=0.05$--$10\,h\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$, of up to $20\%$--$30\%$ to match KiDS-1000 ($68\%$ credible interval, CI). Conversely, a reference with a lower $S_8\approx0.73$ avoids suppression and matches the KiDS-1000 spectrum within a $20\%$ tolerance. When resolved into three $z$-bins, however, and regardless of the reference, we detect structure growth only between $z\approx0.4$--$0.13$, but not between $z\approx0.7$--$0.4$. This could indicate spurious systematic errors in KiDS-1000, inaccuracies in the intrinsic alignment (IA) model, or potentially a non-standard cosmological model with delayed structure growth. In the near future, analysing data from stage-IV surveys with our algorithm promises a substantially more precise reconstruction of the power spectrum.

          The Evolution of Hypervelocity Supernova Survivors and the Outcomes of Interacting Double White Dwarf Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 The recent prediction and discovery of hypervelocity supernova survivors has provided strong evidence that the "dynamically driven double-degenerate double-detonation" (D6) Type Ia supernova scenario occurs in Nature. In this model, the accretion stream from the secondary white dwarf in a double white dwarf binary strikes the primary white dwarf violently enough to trigger a helium shell detonation, which in turn triggers a carbon/oxygen core detonation. If the secondary white dwarf survives the primary's explosion, it will be flung away as a hypervelocity star. While previous work has shown that the hotter observed D6 stars can be broadly understood as secondaries whose outer layers have been heated by their primaries' explosions, the properties of the cooler D6 stars have proven difficult to reproduce. In this paper, we show that the cool D6 stars can be explained by the Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction of helium or carbon/oxygen white dwarfs that underwent significant mass loss and core heating prior to and during the explosion of their white dwarf companions. We find that the current population of known D6 candidates is consistent with ~2% of Type Ia supernovae leaving behind a hypervelocity surviving companion. We also calculate the evolution of hot, low-mass oxygen/neon stars and find reasonable agreement with the properties of the LP 40-365 class of hypervelocity survivors, suggesting that these stars are the kicked remnants of near-Chandrasekhar-mass oxygen/neon white dwarfs that were partially disrupted by oxygen deflagrations. We use these results as motivation for schematic diagrams showing speculative outcomes of interacting double white dwarf binaries, including long-lived merger remnants, Type Ia supernovae, and several kinds of peculiar transients.

          Compact protoplanetary discs can be produced by dead zones

 - **Abstract**
 Radially compact protoplanetary discs (<=50 au) are ubiquitous in nearby star-forming regions. Multiple mechanisms have been invoked to interpret various compact discs. In this paper, we propose that fragmentation of fragile dust grains in moderate turbulence, as expected beyond the dead zone, provides an effective alternative mechanism to form compact discs which are consistent with current observations. We run 1-D dust transport and collision models with DustPy and generate synthetic observations, and find that discs formed by this mechanism have sizes determined by the extent of their dead zones. Accounting for dust porosity, and considering less fragile dust, do not change disc sizes significantly. The smooth dust morphology can be altered only when pressure bumps are present in the dead zone. However, when present at small radii (<=10 au), pressure bumps cannot effectively trap dust. Dust in these bumps fragments and replenishes the inner discs, effectively hiding dust traps in the optically thick inner disc from observations. We note a striking resemblance in the radial intensity profile between our synthetic observations and some recent high-resolution observations of compact discs. We discuss how such observations can inform our understanding of the underlying disc physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Using Gaia DR3 we derive new distances and luminosities for a sample of Galactic B supergiants which were thought to be post main-sequence (MS) objects from their HR diagram location beyond the terminal-age MS (TAMS). When applying the newer Gaia distances in addition to enhanced amounts of core-boundary mixing, aka convective overshooting, we show that these Galactic B supergiants are likely enclosed within the MS band, indicating an evolutionary stage of steady core hydrogen burning. We discuss the importance of considering enhanced overshooting and how vectors in the mass-luminosity plane (ML-plane) can be used to disentangle the effects of wind mass loss from interior mixing. We finish with the key message that any proposed solution to the BSG problem should consider not only an explanation for the sheer number of B supergiants inside the Hertzsprung gap, but should at the same time also account for the steep drop in rotation rates identified at spectral type B1 -- corresponding to an effective temperature of $\sim$21 kK, and for which two distinct families of solutions have been proposed.

          An Alternate Method for Minimizing $\chi^2$

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we describe an algorithm and associated software package (sfit_minimize) for maximizing the likelihood function of a set of parameters by minimizing $\chi^2$. The key element of this method is that the algorithm estimates the second derivative of the $\chi^2$ function using first derivatives of the function to be fitted. These same derivatives can also be used to calculate the uncertainties in each parameter. We test this algorithm against several standard minimization algorithms in this http URL() by fitting point lens models to light curves from the 2018 Korea Microlensing Telescope Network event database. We show that for fitting microlensing events, SFit works faster than the Nelder-Mead simplex method and is more reliable than the BFGS gradient method; we also find that the Newton-CG method is not effective for fitting microlensing events.

 - **Abstract**
 KM3NET has reported the detection of a remarkably high-energy through-going muon. Lighting up about a third of the detector, this muon could originate from a neutrino exceeding 10 PeV energy. The crucial question we need to answer is where this event comes from and what its source is. Intriguingly, IceCube has been running with a much larger effective area for a much longer time, and yet it has not reported neutrinos above 10 PeV. We quantify the tension between the KM3NeT event with the absence of similar high-energy events in IceCube. Through a detailed analysis, we determine the most likely neutrino energy to be in the range 23-2400 PeV. We find a $3.8\sigma$ tension between the two experiments assuming the neutrino to be from the diffuse isotropic neutrino background. Alternatively, assuming the event is of cosmogenic origin and considering three representative models, this tension still falls within 3.2-3.9$\sigma$. The least disfavored scenario is a steady or transient point source, though still leading to $2.9\sigma$ and $2.1\sigma$ tensions, respectively. The lack of observation of high-energy events in IceCube seriously challenges the explanation of this event coming from any known diffuse fluxes. Our results indicate the KM3NeT event is likely the first observation of a new astrophysical source.

 - **Abstract**
 A dedicated search for upward-going air showers at zenith angles exceeding $110^\circ$ and energies $E>0.1$ EeV has been performed using the Fluorescence Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The search is motivated by two "anomalous" radio pulses observed by the ANITA flights I and III which appear inconsistent with the Standard Model of particle physics. Using simulations of both regular cosmic ray showers and upward-going events, a selection procedure has been defined to separate potential upward-going candidate events and the corresponding exposure has been calculated in the energy range [0.1-33] EeV. One event has been found in the search period between 1 Jan 2004 and 31 Dec 2018, consistent with an expected background of $0.27 \pm 0.12$ events from mis-reconstructed cosmic ray showers. This translates to an upper bound on the integral flux of $(7.2 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{-21}$ cm$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ y$^{-1}$ and $(3.6 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{-20}$ cm$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ y$^{-1}$ for an $E^{-1}$ and $E^{-2}$ spectrum, respectively. An upward-going flux of showers normalized to the ANITA observations is shown to predict over 34 events for an $E^{-3}$ spectrum and over 8.1 events for a conservative $E^{-5}$ spectrum, in strong disagreement with the interpretation of the anomalous events as upward-going showers.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 18 pulsar discoveries from the AO327 pulsar survey, along with their timing solutions and those for an additional 31 AO327-discovered pulsars. Timing solutions were constructed using observations from a follow-up timing campaign taken between the periods of 2013 -- 2019 using the Arecibo Observatory's 327-MHz receiver. Aside from PSR J0916+0658, an isolated pulsar that shows evidence for partial recycling, the remaining discoveries are non-recycled pulsars. We present a brief census of emission features for all pulsars with the following standouts. PSR~J1942+0142 is found to exhibit the very rare phenomenon of subpulse bi-drifting and PSR~J0225+1727 has an interpulse. We also report distance estimates using the NE2001 and YMW16 Galactic electron density models, and identify at least 10 sources where either one or both models underestimate the maximum Galactic line of sight dispersion measure.

          Dark energy and lensing anomaly in Planck CMB data

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the impact of the lensing anomaly in Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data on the nature of dark energy (DE). We constrain the state equation ($w_0,w_a$) of DE with the lensing scaling parameter $A_L=1$ and varying $A_L$, using the Planck PR3 and two updated Planck PR4 likelihoods, CamSpec and HiLLiPoP respectively, combined with DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and Pantheon+ supernova data. As expected, when $A_L$ is allowed to vary, the evolving DE is not preferred due to the degeneracy between $w_0,w_a$ and $A_L$. In particular, we also consider replacing DESI BAO data with pre-DESI BAO in our analysis, and observe that DESI BAO appears to exacerbate the lensing anomaly, which is caused by the smaller matter density $\Omega_m$ it prefers, however, this effect can be offset by the shifts in $w_0$ and $w_a$ preferring the evolving DE. Our work indicates that the lensing anomaly in Planck data is worth carefully reconsidering when one combined new cosmological survey data with CMB.

          Context images for Venus Express radio occultation measurements: A search for a correlation between temperature structure and UV contrasts in the clouds of Venus

 - **Abstract**
 Venus exhibits strong and changing contrasts at ultraviolet wavelengths apparently related to the clouds and the dynamics in the cloud layer, but to date their origin continues to be unknown. We investigate the nature of the UV contrasts exhibited by Venus clouds by examining possible correlations between the thermal structure inferred from radio occultation data and UV brightness from imagery data, both observed with Venus Express. We analyse Venus Express images obtained from 11 hours before to a few hours after the time of radio occultation measurements of the same area. We account for the advection of clouds by zonal and meridional winds and apply a phase angle correction to compensate for the changing viewing geometry. We find a possible anti-correlation between UV-brightness and atmospheric temperature in the 65-70 km altitude range for low latitudes. Heating in this altitude and latitude region due to an increase in the UV-absorber has been predicted by radiative forcing studies. The predictions roughly match our observed temperature amplitude between UV-dark and UV-bright regions. We find no evidence for any correlation between UV-brightness and static stability in the atmosphere in the 50-80 km altitude region. This could be the first observational evidence for a direct link between UV-brightness and atmospheric temperature in the 65-70km altitude region in the clouds of Venus.

          Modelling the impact of circumbinary disk accretion on post-AGB binary evolution and surface chemistry

 - **Abstract**
 Post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) binaries are surrounded by dusty circumbinary disks, and exhibit unexpected orbital properties resulting from poorly understood binary interaction processes. Re-accreted gas from the circumbinary disk alters the photospheric chemistry of the post-AGB star, producing a characteristic underabundance of refractory elements that correlates with condensation temperature $\unicode{x2013}$a phenomenon known as chemical depletion. This work investigates how re-accretion from a disk drives chemical depletion, and the impact accreted matter has on post-AGB evolution. We used the MESA code to evolve 0.55 and 0.60 M$_{\odot}$ post-AGB stars with the accretion of refractory element-depleted gas from a circumbinary disk. Our study adopts observationally-constrained initial accretion rates and disk masses to reproduce the chemical depletion patterns of six well-studied post-AGB binary stars: EP Lyr, HP Lyr, IRAS 17038-4815, IRAS 09144-4933, HD 131356, and SX Cen. We find high accretion rates ($>\,$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) and large disk masses ($\geq\,$10$^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$) necessary to reproduce observed depletion, particularly in higher-mass, hotter post-AGB stars (T$_{\textrm{eff}}\geq$ 6000 K). A slower evolution (lower core mass) is required to reproduce cooler (T$_{\textrm{eff}}\leq$ 5000 K) depleted post-AGB stars. Rapid accretion significantly impacts post-AGB evolution, stalling stars at cooler effective temperatures and extending post-AGB lifetimes by factors of around 3 to 10. Despite this, extended post-AGB timescales remain within or below the planetary nebula (PN) visibility timescale, suggesting accretion cannot account for the observed lack of ionised PNe in post-AGB binaries. Our findings constrain accretion-flow parameters and advance our understanding of disk-binary interactions in post-AGB systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine Be star discs in highly eccentric Be/X-ray systems. We use a three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code to model the structure of the Be star disc and investigate its interactions with the secondary star over time. We use system parameters consistent with the eccentric, short-period (P $\approx$ 16 d) Be/X-ray binary A0538-66 as the basis for our models. We explore a range of system geometries by incrementally varying the misalignment angle of the neutron star's orbital plane with respect to the primary star's equatorial plane to cover a complete range from coplanar prograde to coplanar retrograde. For all simulations, we follow the evolution of the disc's total mass and angular momentum as well as the average eccentricity and inclination with respect to the equatorial planes of both the primary and secondary. We also determine the neutron star accretion rates. We find that the high eccentricity of the binary orbit causes all calculated disc parameters to vary with orbital phase in all models. The amplitude of these variations is negatively correlated with misalignment angle for models with misalignment angles less than 90°, and positively correlated for models with misalignment angles greater than 90°. Accretion rates are affected by the number of particles the neutron star interacts with as well as the length of the interaction time between the particles and the neutron star. We find that accretion rates are largest for models with misalignment angles less than 90°, and smaller for models with those greater than 90°.

 - **Abstract**
 Giant impacts dominate the late stages of accretion of rocky planets. They contribute to the heating, melting, and sometimes vaporizing of the bodies involved in the impacts. Due to fractionation during melting and vaporization, planet-building impacts can significantly change the composition and geochemical signatures of rocky objects. Using first-principles molecular dynamics simulations, we analyze the shock behavior of complex realistic silicate systems, representative of both rocky bodies. We introduce a novel criterion for vapor formation that uses entropy calculations to determine the minimum impact velocity required to pass the threshold for vapor production. We derive impact velocity criteria for vapor formation (7.1 km per s for chondritic bodies) and show that this threshold is reached in 61 and 89 percent of impacts in dynamical simulations of the late stages of accretion with classical and annulus starting configuration (respectively) for analogs of Earth. These outcomes should be nuanced by factors such as the impact angle and the mass of the impacting bodies, which further influence the vaporization dynamics and the resultant material distribution. Our findings indicate that vaporization was common during accretion and likely played a crucial role in shaping the early environments and material properties of terrestrial planets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present analyses of a nitrogen-enriched star-forming galaxy, ID60001, at $z=4.6928$ based on JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy and NIRCam photometry. From rest-frame optical emission lines we derive the nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) abundance ratio of ID60001 to be $\log({\rm N/O})=-0.76_{-0.03}^{+0.03}$ ($[{\rm N/O}]=0.10_{-0.03}^{+0.03}$), which is significantly elevated at the corresponding metallicity $12+\log({\rm O/H})=7.75_{-0.01}^{+0.01}$ ($Z/Z_\odot = 0.12$) compared to local counterparts. We discuss possible scenarios for elevated N/O abundance in ID60001, including pristine gas inflow, Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, and Oxygen depletion by Type II supernova winds. Based on the moderately broadened He{\sc ii}$\lambda$4686 emission line, galaxy morphology, and star-formation history, we conclude that the elevated N/O abundance of ID60001 is likely originated from massive ($>25\,M_\odot$) WR stars that directly collapse into a black hole. We also stress the importance of reliable electron density measurements when deriving N/O abundance with rest-frame optical emission lines.

 - **Abstract**
 The canonical cosmological model to explain the recent acceleration of the universe relies on a cosmological constant, and most dynamical dark energy and modified gravity model alternatives are based on scalar fields. Still, further alternatives are possible. One of these involves vector fields: under certain conditions, they can lead to accelerating universes while preserving large-scale homogeneity and isotropy. We report quantitative observational constraints on a model previously proposed by Armendáriz-Picón and known as the cosmic triad. We consider several subclasses of the model, which generically is a parametric extension of the canonical $\Lambda$CDM model, as well as two possible choices of the triad's potential. Our analysis shows that any deviations from this limit are constrained to be small. In particular the preferred present-day values of the matter density and the dark energy equation of state are fully consistent with those obtained, for the same datasets, in flat $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0$CDM. The constraints mildly depend on the priors on the dark energy equation of state, specifically on whether phantom values thereof are allowed, while the choice of potential does not play a significant role since any such potential is constrained to be relatively flat.

 - **Abstract**
 The core-collapse supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is one of the brightest galactic radio sources with an angular radius of $\sim$ 2.5 $\arcmin$. Although no extension of this source has been detected in the $\gamma$-ray band, using more than 1000 days of LHAASO data above $\sim 0.8$ TeV, we find that its spectrum is significantly softer than those obtained with Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) and its flux near $\sim 1$ TeV is about two times higher. In combination with analyses of more than 16 years of \textit{Fermi}-LAT data covering $0.1 \, \mathrm{GeV} - 1 \, \mathrm{TeV}$, we find that the spectrum above 30 GeV deviates significantly from a single power-law, and is best described by a smoothly broken power-law with a spectral index of $1.90 \pm 0.15_\mathrm{stat}$ ($3.41 \pm 0.19_\mathrm{stat}$) below (above) a break energy of $0.63 \pm 0.21_\mathrm{stat} \, \mathrm{TeV}$. Given differences in the angular resolution of LHAASO-WCDA and IACTs, TeV $\gamma$-ray emission detected with LHAASO may have a significant contribution from regions surrounding the SNR illuminated by particles accelerated earlier, which, however, are treated as background by IACTs. Detailed modelling can be used to constrain acceleration processes of TeV particles in the early stage of SNR evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The first in-depth photometric study of four Delta Scuti stars was performed. We used time series data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) that is available in different sectors. According to the extracted maxima from TESS space-based observations, we calculated an ephemeris for each star. We estimated the physical parameters of the target stars based on the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) parallax method. The results obtained for the surface gravity of the stars are consistent with the reports of the TESS Input Catalog and Gaia DR3. We estimated the pulsating constant based on the physical parameters and period of the stars. Therefore, we found that the stars 2MASS 15515693-7759002 and 2MASS 07513202+0526526 belong to the fundamental, while 2MASS 00044615+4936439 and 2MASS 10215638-3326137 relate to the first overtone. The Fourier analysis using the Period04 program was done for each star. As we showed in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram, the stars are located in the instability strip of the Delta Scuti stars region. Four target stars were found to be of the low-amplitude Delta Scuti star type.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, the tribocharging of colliding and bouncing submillimeter (submm) particles has been studied as a possible mechanism promoting the formation of large pebbles on centimeter (cm) to decimeter (dm) scales in protoplanetary disks. Here, we observe, for the first time, that it is not only monolithic, spherical particles, but also real dust aggregates, that become tribocharged and end up forming large clusters. For aggregates of $\sim 0.4$ mm consisting of $\rm \sim$ 1 $\rm \mu m$ sized dust, we determined net charge densities up to $10^{-7}$ C/$\rm m^2$ during our drop tower experiments. These charged aggregates form compact clusters up to 2 cm in size via collisions with other clusters and aggregates at collision velocities on the order of 1 cm/s. Size and speed are the only lower limits for growth, currently set by the limits of the experiment. However, these clusters already form under conditions that are well beyond the expected transition to bouncing for uncharged aggregates and clusters. Our findings further support the idea that collisional charging can leapfrog the traditional bouncing barrier and form larger clusters that then serve as large pebbles. These cm-sized clusters are more susceptible to further evolutionary steps via particle trapping, concentration, and planetesimal formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent evidence for dynamical dark energy from DESI, in combination with other cosmological data, has generated significant interest in understanding the nature of dark energy and its underlying microphysics. However, interpreting these results critically depends on how dark energy is parameterized. This paper examines the robustness of conclusions about the viability of particular kinds of dynamical dark energy models to the choice of parameterization, focusing on four popular two-parameter families: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), and exponential (EXP) parameterizations. We find that conclusions regarding the viability of minimally and non-minimally coupled quintessence models are independent of the parameterization adopted. We demonstrate this both by mapping these dark energy models into the $(w_0, w_a)$ parameter space defined by these various parameterizations and by showing that all of these parameterizations can equivalently account for the phenomenology predicted by these dark energy models to a high degree of accuracy.

          Insights Into Neutron Stars From Gravitational Redshifts and Universal Relations

 - **Abstract**
 The universal relations in neutron stars form an essential entity to understand their properties. The moment of inertia, compactness, love number, mass quadrupole moment, and oscillation modes are some of the properties that have been studied previously in the context of universal relations. All of these quantities are measurable; thus, analyzing them is of utmost importance. This article analyzes the universal relations in the context of a neutron star's gravitational redshift. Using the redshift measurements of RBS 1223, RX J0720.4-3125, and RX J1856.5-3754, we provide theoretical estimates of compactness, the inverse of compactness, the moment of inertia, dimensionless tidal love number, mass quadrupole moment, the mass of the star times the ratio of angular frequency over the spin angular moment, and the average of the speed of sound squared. In the case of the redshift measurement of RX J0720.4-3125, we found that the theoretical estimate using universal relations aligns closely with the Bayesian estimate. Our findings indicate that such theoretical predictions are highly reliable for observations with low uncertainty and can be used as an alternative for statistical analysis. Additionally, we report a violation of the universality of the tidal love number and average of the speed of sound squared with respect to the gravitational redshift. Our calculations also show that the maximum redshift value for neutron stars following the current astrophysical constraints cannot exceed a value of $\le 0.763$.

 - **Abstract**
 Methanol (CH$_3$OH) and formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) are chemically coupled organic molecules proposed to act as an intermediate step between simple molecules and more complex prebiotic compounds. Their abundance distributions across disks regulate the prebiotic potential of material at different disk radii. We present observations of multiple methanol and formaldehyde transitions toward the Herbig Ae disk HD 100546 obtained with ALMA, building upon the previous serendipitous detection of methanol in this source. We find that methanol has a higher rotational temperature ($T_\mathrm{rot}$) than formaldehyde towards both the centrally concentrated emission component in the inner disk ($0-110$ au) and a radially separate dust ring farther out in the disk ($180-260$ au). $T_\mathrm{rot}$ decreases for methanol and formaldehyde from the inner ($152^{+35}_{-27}$ K and $76^{+9}_{-8}$ K) to the outer disk ($52^{+8}_{-6}$ K and $31^{+2}_{-2}$ K), suggesting that we are tracing two different chemical environments. $T_\mathrm{rot}$ for both species in the inner disk is consistent with thermal desorption as the origin, while the outer disk reservoir is driven by non-thermal desorption. The CH$_3$OH/H$_2$CO column density ratio decreases from 14.6$^{+5.2}_{-4.6}$ in the inner disk to $1.3^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ in the outer disk, consistent with modelling predictions. The CH$_3$OH/H$_2$CO column density ratio for the inner disk is consistent with the median value in the range of column density ratios compiled from Solar System comets which would have formed at a similar distance. This supports the notion that interstellar ice is inherited and preserved by protoplanetary disks around solar-mass and intermediate-mass stars as we are seeing 'fresh' ice sublimation, as well as providing more evidence for the presence of prebiotic precursor molecules in planet-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino emission offers a direct probe into the hydrodynamics and energy transport processes within a supernova. Fast-time variations in the neutrino luminosity and mean energy can provide insights into phenomena like turbulence, convection, and shock revival. In this paper, we explore the detection capabilities of large-volume neutrino telescopes such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and the planned IceCube-Gen2 detector in identifying generic fast-time features in the neutrino light curve. We also investigate the potential enhancement in detection sensitivity using wavelength shifters, which can improve light collection efficiency. By employing a Short-Time Fourier Transform analysis, we quantify the excess power in the frequency spectrum arising from fast-time modulations and compute the detection horizon for a range of generic models. We find that with IceCube we can already see the strongest modulation models (>50% amplitude) for progenitors located anywhere in the Milky Way. Sensitivity to weaker modulations (>20% amplitude) is possible in future detectors like IceCube-Gen2, in particular with the use of wavelength shifters. For all detector configurations, the frequency and central time of the fast-time feature at the 5$\sigma$ detection horizon can be measured with a resolution of 7.0 Hz and 17 ms respectively.

          Impact of radiative accelerations on the stellar characterization of FGK-type stars using spectroscopic and seismic constraints

 - **Abstract**
 Chemical transport mechanisms are fundamental processes in stellar evolution models. They are responsible for the chemical distribution, and their impact determines how accurately we can characterize stars. Radiative accelerations are one of these processes. They allow the accumulation of elements at different depths in the star. We aim to assess the impact of radiative accelerations on the modeling of FGK-type stars and their impact on the prediction of surface abundances. To reduce the cost of the computation of radiative accelerations, we implemented the single-valued parameters (SVP) method in the stellar evolution code MESA. The SVP method is more efficient in calculating radiative accelerations, which enables computations of large enough grids of models for stellar characterization. Compared to models that include atomic diffusion (with only gravitational settling), the inclusion of radiative accelerations has a small effect on the inference of fundamental properties, with an impact of 2\%, 0.7\%, and 5\% for mass, radius, and age. However, the treatment of radiative accelerations is necessary to predict the chemical composition of and accurately characterize stars.

 Expanding the number of hot giant planets with atmospheric characterisation can improve our understanding of their atmospheres as well as their formation and evolution mechanisms. In this work, we use high-resolution spectroscopy in the near-infrared (NIR) to search for chemical signatures in the atmospheres of the two hot Jupiters KELT-8 b and KELT-23 Ab, and perform a first characterisation of their atmospheric properties. We measured the transmission spectrum of each target with the NIR high-resolution spectrograph GIANO-B at the TNG and searched for atmospheric signals by cross-correlating the data with synthetic transmission spectra. In order to characterise the chemical-physical properties of the two atmospheres, we ran two different atmospheric retrievals for each dataset: a retrieval assuming chemical equilibrium and a ``free-chemistry'' retrieval, in which the abundance of each molecule could vary freely. We detect $H_2O$ in the atmospheres of KELT-8 b and KELT-23 Ab with an S/N = 6.6 and S/N = 4.2, respectively. The two retrievals indicate a water-rich atmosphere for both targets. For KELT-8 b, we determine a water volume mixing ratio of log$_{10}$(VMR$_{\rm H_2O})=-2.07^{+0.53}_{-0.72}$, a metallicity [M/H] $=0.77^{+0.61}_{-0.89}$ dex, and a sub-solar C/O ratio (C/O $\leq0.30$, at $2\,\sigma$). For KELT-23 Ab, we find log$_{10}$(VMR$_{\rm H_2O})=-2.26^{+0.75}_{-1.24}$, [M/H] $=-0.42^{+1.56}_{-1.35}$ dex, and a C/O ratio $\leq0.78$ (at $2\,\sigma$). Comparing these chemical properties with those of the host stars, we suggest that, for both planets, the accretion of gaseous material occurred within the $H_2O$ snowline in a pebble-rich disk enriched in oxygen due to sublimation of water ice from the inward-drifting pebbles. In conclusion, we measure the atmospheric signals of KELT-8 b and KELT-23 Ab for the first time and place first constraints on their properties.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a MIRI-MRS spectrum of the high-inclination protoplanetary disk around the solar-mass (K0) star MY Lup, obtained as part of the JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS). The spectrum shows an unusually weak water emission spectrum for a disk around a star of its spectral type, but strong emission from CO$_2$, HCN, and isotopologues of both molecules. This includes the first ever detection of C$^{18}$O$^{16}$O and H$^{13}$CN in an inner disk, as well as tentative detections of C$^{17}$O$^{16}$O and HC$^{15}$N. Slab modeling provides molecular temperatures, column densities and emitting areas of the detected molecules. The emitting molecular gas is cold compared to that of other observed protoplanetary disk spectra. We estimate the isotopologue ratios of CO$_2$ and HCN, albeit with significant uncertainty. We suggest that the unusual spectrum of MY Lup arises from a combination of inner disk clearing, which removes emission from warm water, and its nearly edge-on inclination, which enhances line-of-sight column densities, although unusual chemistry may also be required. MY Lup's spectrum highlights the potential to detect and measure trace isotopologues to study isotopic fractionation in protoplanetary disks; observations at higher spectral resolving power is needed to constrain the isotopologue ratios to greater precision.
