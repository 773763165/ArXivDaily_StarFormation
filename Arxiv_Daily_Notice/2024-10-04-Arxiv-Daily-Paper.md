          Searching for new physics using high precision absorption spectroscopy; continuum placement uncertainties and the fine structure constant in strong gravity

 - **Abstract**
 Searches for variations of fundamental constants require a comprehensive understanding of measurement errors. This paper examines a source of error that is usually overlooked: the impact of continuum placement error. We investigate the problem using a high resolution, high signal to noise spectrum of the white dwarf G191$-$B2B. Narrow photospheric absorption lines allow us to search for new physics in the presence of a gravitational field approximately $10^4$ times that on Earth. Modelling photospheric lines requires knowing the underlying spectral continuum level. We describe the development of a fully automated, objective, and reproducible continuum estimation method. Measurements of the fine structure constant are produced using several continuum models. The results show that continuum placement variations result in small systematic shifts in the centroids of narrow photospheric absorption lines which impact significantly on fine structure constant measurements. This effect should therefore be included in the error budgets of future measurements. Our results suggest that continuum placement variations should be investigated in other contexts, including fine structure constant measurements in stars other than white dwarfs. The analysis presented here is based on NiV absorption lines in the photosphere of G191$-$B2B. Curiously, the inferred measurement of the fine structure constant obtained in this paper using NiV (the least negative of our measurements is $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = -1.462 \pm 1.121 \times 10^{-5}$) is inconsistent with the most recent previous G191$-$B2B photospheric measurement using FeV ($\Delta\alpha/\alpha = 6.36 \pm 0.35_{stat} \pm 1.84_{sys} \times 10^{-5}$). Given both measurements are derived from the same spectrum, we presume (but in this work are unable to check) that this 3.2$\sigma$ difference results from unknown laboratory wavelength systematics.

          Explanation to the article "On the calibration of ultra-high energy EASs at the Yakutsk array and Telescope Array"

 - **Abstract**
 We provide a detailed commentary on the energy calibration of the TA experiment described in our paper (arXiv:2404.16948 [astro-ph.HE]). That paper concludes that the TA energy estimation, which is tied to optical measurements, might be incorrect. A response from members of the TA Collaboration (arXiv:2407.12892 [astro-ph.HE]) states that this conclusion is wrong and "stems from a misinterpretation and an incorrect application of the TA energy deposit formula". Here we demonstrate that our formula for energy deposit is not in fact a rescaled modification of the TA equation, but follows from description of the processes occurring during the passage of charged particles through 1.2 cm thick scintillator. Our estimation of the TA detector response implies the correctness of the cosmic ray spectrum derived from readings of surface detectors of the array.

 - **Abstract**
 A successful detection of the cosmological 21-cm signal from intensity mapping experiments (for example, during the Epoch of Reioinization or Cosmic Dawn) is contingent on the suppression of subtle systematic effects in the data. Some of these systematic effects, with mutual coupling a major concern in interferometric data, manifest with temporal variability distinct from that of the cosmological signal. Fringe-rate filtering -- a time-based Fourier filtering technique -- is a powerful tool for mitigating these effects; however, fringe-rate filters also attenuate the cosmological signal. Analyses that employ fringe-rate filters must therefore be supplemented by careful accounting of the signal loss incurred by the filters. In this paper, we present a generalized formalism for characterizing how the cosmological 21-cm signal is attenuated by linear time-based filters applied to interferometric visibilities from drift-scanning telescopes. Our formalism primarily relies on analytic calculations and therefore has a greatly reduced computational cost relative to traditional Monte Carlo signal loss analyses. We apply our signal loss formalism to a filtering strategy used by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) and compare our analytic predictions against signal loss estimates obtained through a Monte Carlo analysis. We find excellent agreement between the analytic predictions and Monte Carlo estimates and therefore conclude that HERA, as well as any other drift-scanning interferometric experiment, should use our signal loss formalism when applying linear, time-based filters to the visibilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) could compose the dark matter content of the Universe. We present the first simulations of cosmological structure formation with PBH dark matter that consistently include collisional few-body effects, post-Newtonian orbit corrections, orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission, and black-hole mergers. We carefully construct initial conditions by considering the evolution during radiation domination as well as early-forming binary systems. We identify numerous dynamical effects due to the collisional nature of PBH dark matter, including evolution of the internal structures of PBH halos and the formation of a hot component of PBHs. We also study the properties of the emergent population of PBH binary systems, distinguishing those that form at primordial times from those that form during the nonlinear structure formation process. These results will be crucial to sharpen constraints on the PBH scenario derived from observational constraints on the gravitational wave background. Even under conservative assumptions, the gravitational radiation emitted over the course of the simulation appears to exceed current limits from ground-based experiments, but this depends on the evolution of the gravitational wave spectrum and PBH merger rate toward lower redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamical interactions in dense star clusters could significantly influence the properties of black holes, leaving imprints on their gravitational-wave signatures. While previous studies have mostly focused on repeated black hole mergers for spin and mass growth, this work examines the impact of physical collisions and close encounters between black holes and (non-compact) stars. Using Monte Carlo N-body models of dense star clusters, we find that a large fraction of black holes retained upon formation undergo collisions with stars. Within our explored cluster models, the proportion of binary black hole mergers affected by stellar collisions ranges from $10\%$ to $60\%$. If all stellar-mass black holes are initially non-spinning, we find that up to $40\%$ of merging binary black holes may have components with dimensionless spin parameter $\chi\gtrsim 0.2$ because of prior stellar collisions, while typically about $10\%$ have spins near $\chi = 0.7$ from prior black hole mergers. We demonstrate that young star clusters are especially important environments as they can produce collisions of black holes with very massive stars, allowing significant spin up of the black holes through accretion. Our predictions for black hole spin distributions from these stellar collisions highlight their sensitivity to accretion efficiency, underscoring the need for detailed hydrodynamic calculations to better understand the accretion physics following these interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 Lithium plays a crucial role in probing stellar physics and stellar and primordial nucleosynthesis, as well as the chemical evolution of our Galaxy. Stars are considered to be the main source of Li, still the identity of its primary stellar producer has long been a matter of debate. In light of recent theoretical and observational results, we investigate in this study the role of two candidate sources of Li enrichment in the Milky Way, namely AGB stars and, in particular, novae. We utilize a one-zone Galactic chemical evolution model to assess the viability of AGB stars and novae as stellar sources of Li. We use recent theoretical Li yields for AGB stars, while for novae we adopt observationally inferred Li yields and recently derived Delay Time Distributions (DTDs). Subsequently, we extend our analysis using a multi-zone model with radial migration to investigate spatial variations in the evolution of Li across the Milky Way disc and compare the results with observational data for field stars and open clusters. Our analysis shows that AGB stars fail by far to reproduce the meteoritic Li abundance. In contrast, novae appear as promising candidates within the adopted framework, allowing us to quantify the contribution of each Li source at Sun's formation and today. Our multi-zone model reveals the role of the differences in the DTDs of SN Ia and novae in shaping the evolution of Li in the various galactic zones. Its results are in fair agreement with the observational data for most open clusters, but small discrepancies appear in the outer disc.

 - **Abstract**
 On 2022 March 10, a coronal mass ejection (CME) erupted from the Sun, resulting in Solar Orbiter observations at 0.45 au of both dispersive solar energetic particles arriving prior to the interplanetary CME (ICME) and locally accelerated particles near the ICME-associated shock structure as it passed the spacecraft on 2022 March 11. This shock was later detected on 2022 March 14 by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), which was radially aligned with Solar Orbiter, at 1 au. Ion composition data from both spacecraft -- via the Solar Orbiter Energetic Particle Detector/ Suprathermal Ion Spectrograph (EPD/SIS) and the Ultra Low Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS) on ACE -- allows for in-depth analysis of the radial evolution of species-dependent ICME shock-associated acceleration processes for this event. We present a study of the ion spectra observed at 0.45 and 1 au during both the gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) and energetic storm particle (ESP) phases of the event. We find that the shapes of the spectra seen at each spacecraft have significant differences that were likely caused by varying shock geometry: Solar Orbiter spectra tend to lack spectral breaks, and the higher energy portions of the ACE spectra have comparable average flux to the Solar Orbiter spectra. Through an analysis of rigidity effects on the spectral breaks observed by ACE, we conclude that the 1 au observations were largely influenced by a suprathermal pool of $\mathrm{He}^{+}$ ions that were enhanced due to propagation along a stream interaction region (SIR) that was interacting with the ICME at times of observation.

 - **Abstract**
 Born as ice-rich planetesimals, cometary nuclei were gravitationally scattered onto their current orbits in the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud during the giant planets' dynamical instability in the early stages of our Solar System's history. Here, we model the thermal evolution of planetesimals during and after the giant planet instability. We couple an adapted thermal evolution model to orbital trajectories provided by \textit{N}-body simulations to account for the planetesimals' orbital evolution, a parameter so far neglected by previous thermal evolution studies. Our simulations demonstrate intense thermal processing in all planetesimal populations, concerning mainly the hyper-volatile ice content. Unlike previous predictions, we show that hyper-volatile survival was possible in a significant number of planetesimals of the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud. Planetesimals ejected into the interstellar space proved to be the most processed, while planetesimals ending in the Oort Cloud were the least processed population. We show that processing differences between populations are a direct consequence of their orbital evolution patterns, and that they provide a natural explanation for the observed variability in the abundance ratios of CO on cometary populations and on the recent observations of long-distance CO-driven activity on inbound Long-period Comets.

 - **Abstract**
 Cepheid masses continue to be important tests of evolutionary tracks for intermediate mass stars as well as important predictors of their future fate. For systems where the secondary is a B star, {\it Hubble Space Telescope} ultraviolet spectra have been obtained. From these spectra a temperature can be derived, and from this a mass of the companion M$_2$. Once {\it Gaia} DR4 is available, proper motions can be used to determine the inclination of the orbit. Combining mass of the companion, M$_2$, the mass function from the ground-based orbit of the Cepheid and the inclination produces the mass of the Cepheid, M$_1$. The Cepheid system FN Vel is used here to demonstrate this approach and what limits can be put on the Cepheid mass for inclination between 50 and 130$^o$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) is a high contrast imaging instrument that aims to detect and characterize extrasolar planets. GPI is being upgraded to GPI 2.0, with several subsystems receiving a re-design to improve its contrast. To enable observations on fainter targets and increase performance on brighter ones, one of the upgrades is to the adaptive optics system. The current Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (WFS) is being replaced by a pyramid WFS with an low-noise electron multiplying CCD (EMCCD). EMCCDs are detectors capable of counting single photon events at high speed and high sensitivity. In this work, we characterize the performance of the HNü 240 EMCCD from Nüvü Cameras, which was custom-built for GPI 2.0. Through our performance evaluation we found that the operating mode of the camera had to be changed from inverted-mode (IMO) to non-inverted mode (NIMO) in order to improve charge diffusion features found in the detector's images. Here, we characterize the EMCCD's noise contributors (readout noise, clock-induced charges, dark current) and linearity tests (EM gain, exposure time) before and after the switch to NIMO.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Natural interstellar objects do not form isolated in deep space, but escape their natal planetary systems. Early removal from their home star systems via close flybys with still-forming planets could be the dominant ejection mechanism. However, dynamically evolved planetary systems such as the Solar System may also be a significant source of natural interstellar objects. Aims. We studied the dynamical evolution of two unusual Solar System hyperbolic comets, C/1980 E1 (Bowell) and C/2024 L5 (ATLAS), to investigate the circumstances that led them to reach moderate Solar System excess hyperbolic speeds. Methods. We used N-body simulations and statistical analyses to explore the planetary encounters that led to the ejection of C/1980 E1 and C/2024 L5, and studied their pre- and post-encounter trajectories. Results. We confirm that C/1980 E1 reached its present path into interstellar space after an encounter with Jupiter at 0.23 au on December 9, 1980. C/2024 L5 was scattered out of the Solar System following a flyby to Saturn at 0.003 au on January 24, 2022. Integrations backward in time show that C/1980 E1 came from the inner Oort cloud but C/2024 L5 could be a former retrograde, inactive Centaur. The receding velocities of C/1980 E1 and C/2024 L5 when entering interstellar space will be 3.8 and 2.8 km/s, moving towards Aries and Triangulum, respectively. Conclusions. Our results for two comets ejected from the Solar System indicate that dynamically evolved planetary systems can be effective sources of interstellar objects and provide constraints on their velocity distribution.

          TESS Asteroseismic Masses and Radii of Red Giants with (and without) Planets

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of asteroseismically derived surface gravities, masses, and radii of a sample of red giant stars both with and without confirmed planetary companions using TESS photometric light curves. These red giants were drawn from radial velocity surveys, and their reported properties in the literature rely on more traditional methods using spectroscopy and isochrone fitting. Our asteroseismically derived surface gravities achieved a precision of $\sim$0.01 dex; however, they were on average $\sim$0.1~dex smaller than the literature. The systematic larger gravities of the literature could plausibly present as a systematic overestimation of stellar masses, which would in turn lead to overestimated planetary masses of the companions. We find that the fractional discrepancies between our asteroseismically-determined parameters and those previously found are typically larger for stellar radii ($\sim$10% discrepancy) than for stellar masses ($<5$% discrepancy). However, no evidence of a systematic difference between methods was found for either fundamental parameter. Two stars, HD~100065 and HD~18742, showed significant disagreement with the literature in both mass and radii. We explore the impacts on updated stellar properties on inferred planetary properties and caution that red giant radii may be more poorly constrained than uncertainties suggest.

 - **Abstract**
 The current accelerated expansion of the Universe remains ones of the most intriguing topics in modern cosmology, driving the search for innovative statistical techniques. Recent advancements in machine learning have significantly enhanced its application across various scientific fields, including physics, and particularly cosmology, where data analysis plays a crucial role in problem-solving. In this work, a non-parametric regression method with Gaussian processes is presented along with several applications to reconstruct some cosmological observables, such as the deceleration parameter and the dark energy equation of state, in order to contribute with some information that helps to clarify the behavior of the Universe. It was found that the results are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM and the predicted value of the Hubble parameter at redshift zero is $H_{0}=68.798\pm 6.340(1\sigma) \text{ km}\text{ Mpc}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent observation of high-energy neutrinos from the Galactic plane implies an abundant population of hadronic cosmic-ray sources in the Milky Way. We explore the role of the coronae of accreting stellar-mass black holes as such astroparticle emitters. We show that the particle acceleration and interaction timescales in the coronal region are tied to the compactness of the X-ray source. Thus, neutrino emission processes may similarly happen in the cores of active galactic nuclei and black hole X-ray binaries (XRB), despite of their drastically different masses and physical sizes. We apply the model to the well-measured XRB Cygnus X-1 and find that the cascaded gamma rays accompanying the neutrino emission naturally explain the GeV emission that only presents during the source's hard state. We show that XRB coronae could contribute significantly to the Galactic cosmic-ray and Galactic plane neutrino fluxes. Our model predicts variable high-energy neutrino emission from bright Galactic XRBs that may be observed by IceCube and future neutrino observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are an important way to probe the properties of stellar populations surrounding supermassive black holes. Observed spectra of several TDEs, such as ASASSN-14li, show high nitrogen to carbon abundance ratios, leading to questions about their progenitors. Disrupting an intermediate- or high-mass star that has undergone CNO processing, increasing the nitrogen in its core, could lead to an enhanced nitrogen TDE. Galactic nuclei present a conducive environment for high-velocity stellar collisions that can lead to high mass loss, stripping the carbon- and hydrogen-rich envelopes of the stars and leaving behind the enhanced nitrogen cores. TDEs of these stripped stars may therefore exhibit even more extreme nitrogen enhancement. Using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code StarSmasher, we provide a parameter space study of high-velocity stellar collisions involving intermediate-mass stars, analyzing the composition of the collision products. We conclude that high-velocity stellar collisions can form products that have abundance ratios similar to those observed in the motivating TDEs. Furthermore, we show that stars that have not experienced high CNO processing can yield low-mass collision products that retain even higher nitrogen to carbon abundance ratios. We analytically estimate the mass fallback for a typical TDE of several collision products to demonstrate consistency between our models and TDE observations. Lastly, we discuss how the extended collision products, with high central to average density ratios, can be related to repeated partial TDEs like ASASSN-14ko and G objects in the Galactic Center.

          Evidence that Planets in the Radius Gap Do Not Resemble Their Neighbors

 - **Abstract**
 Planets in compact multi-transiting systems tend to exhibit self-similarity with their neighbors, a phenomenon commonly called "peas-in-a-pod". Previous studies have identified that this self-similarity appears independently among super-Earths and sub-Neptunes orbiting the same star. In this study, we investigate whether the peas-in-a-pod phenomenon holds for planets in the radius gap between these two categories (located at $\sim$1.8$R_{\oplus}$). Employing the Kepler sample of planets in multi-transiting systems, we calculate the radius ratios between radius gap planets and their neighbors. We find that in systems in possession of a radius gap planet, there is a statistically significant deficit of planet pairs with radius ratios near unity, at the level of $3-4\sigma$. We find that neighbors to radius gap planets actually exhibit reverse size-ordering (that is, a larger inner planet is followed by an outer smaller planet) more often than they exhibit self-similarity. We go on to compare whether the period ratios between neighboring planets also differ, and find that radius gap planets are likelier to reside in mean motion resonance with neighbors, compared to non-gap planets (particularly in the 3:2 configuration). We explore the possibility that systems with a radius gap planet may be modified by a process other than photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss. The appearance in tandem of unusual size-ordering of gap planets in multi-planet systems, together with unusual spacing, furnishes potential supporting evidence in favor of giant impacts sculpting the radius distribution to some degree.

 - **Abstract**
 The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a cosmic-ray detector as well as a pair-converting $\gamma$-ray telescope. The effective area, reflecting the geometrical cross-section area, the $\gamma$-ray conversion probability and the photon selection efficiency, is important in the $\gamma$-ray analyses. In the work, we find a significant time variation in the effective area, as large as $\sim -4\%/{\rm yr}$ at 2 GeV for the high-energy trigger. We derive the data-based correction factors to the effective areas and apply corrections to both the effective areas and the exposure maps. The calibrated exposure can be $\sim 12\%$ smaller than the Monte Carlo one on average at 2 GeV. The calibration is further verified using the observation of the Vela pulsar, showing the spectral parameters with the correction are more consistent with those in the Fermi-LAT catalog than the ones without correction. All the corrections are now implemented in the latest version of the DAMPE $\gamma$-ray analysis toolkit DmpST.

          The non-thermal emission following GW170817 is consistent with a conical radially-stratified outflow with initial Lorentz factor $\lesssim10$

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the non-thermal radio to X-ray emission following the neutron star merger GW\,170817 is consistent with synchrotron emission from a collisionless shock driven into the interstellar medium (ISM) by a conical radially stratified outflow observed $\approx0.25$~rad off-axis, with a power-low mass dependence on momentum, $M(>\gamma\beta)\propto(\gamma\beta)^{-5}$, maximum Lorenz factor $\gamma\approx10$, opening (half-)angle $\approx0.2$~rad, and total energy of $\approx10^{51}$erg. The temporal dependence of the flux during its rising phase is determined by the radial stratification structure, which determines the rate at which outflow energy is deposited in the ISM. This is in contrast with highly relativistic, $\gamma\approx100$, structured jet models, where the angular jet structure determines the time dependence through the gradual "unveiling" by deceleration of larger angular sections of the jet (which are initially "hidden" by relativistic beaming), typically leading to a predicted flux decline after the peak that is faster than observed. Our model predicts a dependence on the observing angle, which is different than that predicted by highly relativistic jet models. Particularly, similar merger events observed closer to the symmetry axis are predicted to show a similarly extended duration of flux increase with time. Our analysis demonstrates that the data do not require a highly relativistic $\gamma\approx100$ component, but the presence of such a component with opening angle $\ll0.2$~rad and energy $\ll10^{51}$~erg cannot be excluded.

 We present the results from spectroscopic and photometric analysis of 17 globular cluster (GC) candidates in the Irr II galaxy NGC 3077. The GC candidates were selected on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images and were cleaned of foreground Galactic stars using the GAIA parameters. We carried out aperture photometry using the multi-band archival images from SDSS, and 2MASS of all candidates, and low resolution (R= 1000) spectroscopic observations of 12 GC candidates and three suspected foreground stars using the OSIRIS/MOS mode at the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). Age, metallicity and extinction values were determined both using spectroscopic and photometric data, independently. We find three of the 17 candidates are old (age >10 Gyr), metal-poor ([Fe/H]<-1.0 dex), massive (mass>10^5 Msun) GCs with characteristics similar to the classical GCs in the Milky Way. The rest are intermediate-age clusters (IACs) with typical ages of 3 to 4 Gyr, and in general metal-rich clusters. The radial velocities of both populations are within 100 km/s of the recessional velocity of the host galaxy. A relatively large population of IACs and low value of GC specific frequency (Sn=0.7) suggest that the pre-interaction galaxy was actively forming stars and star clusters, and is unlikely to be a dE as suggested in some previous works.

 - **Abstract**
 Blurred reflection features are commonly observed in the X-ray spectra of accreting black holes. In the presence of high-quality data and with the correct astrophysical model, X-ray reflection spectroscopy is a powerful tool to probe the strong gravity region of black holes, study the morphology of the accreting matter, measure black hole spins, and test Einstein's theory of General Relativity in the strong field regime. In the past 10-15 years, there has been significant progress in the development of the analysis of these reflection features, thanks to both more sophisticated theoretical models and new observational data. However, the next generation of X-ray missions (e.g. eXTP, Athena, HEX-P) promises to provide unprecedented high-quality data, which will necessarily require more accurate synthetic reflection spectra than those available today. In this talk, I will review the state-of-the-art in reflection modeling and I will present current efforts to develop a new generation of reflection models with machine learning techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of an asteroseismic study of HD 118660 (TIC 171729860), being a chemically peculiar (mild Am) star exhibiting $\delta$ Scuti ($\delta$ Sct) pulsations. It is based on the analysis of two sectors of time-series photometry from the space mission TESS and seismic modelling. It yielded the detection of 15 and 16 frequencies for TESS sectors 23 and 50, respectively. The identified pulsation modes include four radial ($\ell=0$) and five dipolar ($\ell=1$) ones. The radial modes are overtones with order $n$ ranging from $3$ and $6$. Such high values of $n$ are theoretically not expected for stars with the effective temperature of HD 118660 ($\rm T_{\rm eff}\approx 7550 \rm K$ ) located near the red edge of the $\delta$ Sct instability strip. To estimate the asteroseismic parameters, we have generated a grid of stellar models assuming a solar metallicity ($Z=0.014$) and different values for the convective overshooting parameter ($0.1\leq \alpha_{\rm ov}\leq 0.3$). We conclude that the analysis of the radial modes is insufficient to constrain $\alpha_{\rm ov}$ and $Z$ for $\delta$ Sct stars. The value for the equatorial velocity of HD 118660 derived from the seismic radius and the rotational frequency is consistent with values found in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars end their life as core-collapse supernovae, amongst which some extremes are Type Ic broad-lined supernovae associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) having powerful relativistic jets. Their less-extreme brethren make unsuccessful jets that are choked inside the stars, appearing as X-ray flashes or low-luminosity GRBs. On the other hand, there exists a population of extragalactic fast X-ray transients (EFXTs) with timescales ranging from seconds to thousands of seconds, whose origins remain obscure. Known sources that contribute to the observed EFXT population include the softer analogs of LGRBs, shock breakouts of supernovae, or unsuccessful jets. Here, we report the discovery of the bright X-ray transient EP240414a detected by the Einstein Probe (EP), which is associated with the Type Ic supernova SN 2024gsa at a redshift of 0.401. The X-ray emission evolution is characterised by a very soft energy spectrum peaking at < 1.3 keV, which makes it distinct from known LGRBs, X-ray flashes, or low-luminosity GRBs. Follow-up observations at optical and radio bands revealed the existence of a weak relativistic jet that interacts with an extended shell surrounding the progenitor star. Located on the outskirts of a massive galaxy, this event reveals a new population of explosions of Wolf-Rayet stars characterised by a less powerful engine that drives a successful but weak jet, possibly owing to a progenitor star with a smaller core angular momentum than in traditional LGRB progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Dust grains in circumstellar envelopes are likely to have a spread-out temperature distribution. Aims. To investigate how trends in temperature distribution between small and large grains affect the hot corino chemistry of complex organic molecules (COMs) and warm carbon-chain chemistry (WCCC). Methods. A multi-grain multi-layer astrochemical code with an up-to-date treatment of surface chemistry was used with three grain temperature trends: grain temperature proportional to grain radius to the power -1/6 (Model M-1/6), to 0 (M0), and to 1/6 (M1/6). The cases of hot corino and WCCC chemistry were investigated, for a total of six models. The essence of these changes is for the main ice reservoir - small grains - having higher (M-1/6) or lower (M1/6) temperature than the surrounding gas. Results. The chemistry of COMs shows better agreement with observations in models M-1/6 and M1/6 than in Model M0. Model M-1/6 shows best agreement for WCCC because earlier mass-evaporation of methane ice from small grains induces the WCCC phenomenon at lower temperatures. Conclusions. Models considering several grain populations with different temperatures can more precisely reproduce circumstellar chemistry.

          Long-term Monte Carlo based neutrino-radiation viscous-hydrodynamics simulations for a merger remnant black hole-torus system

 - **Abstract**
 We present our new general relativistic Monte Carlo (MC)-based neutrino radiation hydrodynamics code designed to solve axisymmetric systems with several improvements. The main improvements are as follows: (i) the development of an extended version of the implicit MC method for multi-species radiation fields; (ii) modeling of neutrino pair process rates based on a new numerically efficient and asymptotically correct fitting function for the kernel function; (iii) the implementation of new numerical limiters on the radiation-matter interaction to ensure a stable and physically correct evolution of the system. We apply our code to a black hole (BH)-torus system with a BH mass of $3\,M_\odot$, BH dimmensionless spin of 0.8, and a torus mass of $0.1\,M_\odot$, which mimics a post-merger remnant of a binary neutron star merger in the case that the massive neutron star collapses to a BH within a short time scale ($\sim10\,{\rm ms}$). We follow the evolution of the BH-torus system up to more than $1\,{\rm s}$ with our MC-based radiation viscous-hydrodynamics code that dynamically takes into account non-thermal pair process. We find that the system evolution and the various key quantities, such as neutrino luminosity, ejecta mass, torus $Y_e$, and pair annihilation luminosity, are broadly in agreement with the results of the previous studies. We also find that the $\nu_e{\bar \nu}_e$ pair annihilation can launch a relativistic outflow for a time scale of $\sim 0.1\,{\rm s}$, and it can be energetic enough to explain some of short-hard gamma-ray bursts and the precursors. Finally, we calculate the indicators of the fast flavor instability directly from the obtained neutrino distribution functions, which indicate that the instability can occur particularly near the equatorial region of the torus.

 This paper traces the 37 years of my career dedicated to the development of integral field spectroscopy (IFS), highlighting significant milestones and advancements. This extensive journey encompasses three generations of IFS: the initial prototype TIGER at CFHT, the first generation including OASIS at CFHT and SAURON at WHT, the second generation with MUSE at VLT, and the potential third generation represented by the Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) project. Throughout, I discuss the lessons learned at each stage and provide my perspective on the future of IFS.

 - **Abstract**
 Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS) was mapped by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/Mid-Infrared Instrument (4.9-27.9 micron) in July and August 2022. These observations took place alongside a suite of visual and infrared observations from; Hubble, JWST/NIRCam, Very Large Telescope/VISIR and amateur observers which provided both spatial and temporal context across the jovian disc. The stratospheric temperature structure retrieved using the NEMESIS software revealed a series of hot-spots above the GRS. These could be the consequence of GRS-induced wave activity. In the troposphere, the temperature structure was used to derive the thermal wind structure of the GRS vortex. These winds were only consistent with the independently determined wind field by JWST/NIRCam at 240 mbar if the altitude of the Hubble-derived winds were located around 1,200 mbar, considerably deeper than previously assumed. No enhancement in ammonia was found within the GRS but a link between elevated aerosol and phosphine abundances was observed within this region. North-south asymmetries were observed in the retrieved temperature, ammonia, phosphine and aerosol structure, consistent with the GRS tilting in the north-south direction. Finally, a small storm was captured north-west of the GRS that displayed a considerable excess in retrieved phosphine abundance, suggestive of vigorous convection. Despite this, no ammonia ice was detected in this region. The novelty of JWST required us to develop custom-made software to resolve challenges in calibration of the data. This involved the derivation of the "FLT-5" wavelength calibration solution that has subsequently been integrated into the standard calibration pipeline.

 SDO-FM is a foundation model using data from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft; integrating three separate instruments to encapsulate the Sun's complex physical interactions into a multi-modal embedding space. This model can be used to streamline scientific investigations involving SDO by making the enormous datasets more computationally accessible for heliophysics research and enable investigations that require instrument fusion. We discuss four key components: an ingestion pipeline to create machine learning ready datasets, the model architecture and training approach, resultant embeddings and fine-tunable models, and finally downstream fine-tuned applications. A key component of this effort has been to include subject matter specialists at each stage of development; reviewing the scientific value and providing guidance for model architecture, dataset, and training paradigm decisions. This paper marks release of our pretrained models and embedding datasets, available to the community on Hugging Face and this http URL.

 The ComPair balloon instrument is a prototype gamma-ray telescope that aims to further develop technology for observing the gamma-ray sky in the MeV regime. ComPair combines four detector subsystems to enable parallel Compton scattering and pair-production detection, critical for observing in this energy range. This includes a 10 layer double-sided silicon strip detector tracker, a virtual Frisch grid low energy CZT calorimeter, a high energy CsI calorimeter, and a plastic scintillator anti-coincidence detector. The inaugural balloon flight successfully launched from the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility site in Fort Sumner, New Mexico, in late August 2023, lasting approximately 6.5 hours in duration. In this proceeding, we discuss the development of the ComPair Since balloon payload, the performance during flight, and early results.

          LMC Calls, Milky Way Halo Answers: Disentangling the Effects of the MW--LMC Interaction on Stellar Stream Populations

 - **Abstract**
 The infall of the LMC into the Milky Way (MW) has dynamical implications throughout the MW's dark matter halo. We study the impact of this merger on the statistical properties of populations of simulated stellar streams. Specifically, we investigate the radial and on-sky angular dependence of stream perturbations caused by the direct effect of stream-LMC interactions and/or the response of the MW dark matter halo. We use a time-evolving MW--LMC simulation described by basis function expansions to simulate streams. We quantify the degree of perturbation using a set of stream property statistics including the misalignment of proper motions with the stream track. In the outer halo, direct stream--LMC interactions produce a statistically significant effect, boosting the fraction of misaligned proper motions by ~25% compared to the model with no LMC. Moreover, there is on-sky angular dependence of stream perturbations:~the highest fractions of perturbed streams coincide with the same on-sky quadrant as the present-day LMC location. In the inner halo, the MW halo dipole response primarily drives stream perturbations, but it remains uncertain whether this is a detectable signature distinct from the LMC's influence. For the fiducial MW--LMC model, we find agreement between the predicted fraction of streams with significantly misaligned proper motions, $\bar{\vartheta}>10^{\circ}$, and Dark Energy Survey data. Finally, we predict this fraction for the Vera Rubin Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) footprint. Using LSST data will improve our constraints on dark matter models and LMC properties as it is sensitive to both.

          Chemo-dynamical abundance analysis of the very metal-poor halo star HE 2315-4240

 - **Abstract**
 Learning about the chemical evolution of the universe is crucial to understanding the formation of the first stars and structure formation in the early universe. To find out how elements are produced via nucleosynthesis and how their relative amounts have evolved with time, abundance trends of stars with different metallicities can be established and compared. In this study, we present a spectrum of a very metal-poor star, HE 2315$-$4240, with [Fe/H] = $-$2.89 based on a Magellan/MIKE high-resolution visual light spectrum. The star has a radial velocity of +41.9 km s$^{-1}$, an effective temperature of 5181 K, a surface gravity of 2.24 dex, and a microturbulence of 1.61 km s$^{-1}$. The $\alpha$-elements and the iron peak elements agree well with the abundance trend. The low abundance of [Sr/Ba] and [C/Fe] suggests that HE 2315$-$4240 is accreted and formed in a dwarf galaxy. The value of [Ba/Eu] suggests the operation of a limited r-process. The abundance pattern of [Mg/Fe] and [Si/Fe] in HE 2315$-$4240 and its metallicity indicated that the star is formed from the gas enriched by a Type II supernova of a massive Pop III star. The abundance pattern fits Population III supernova yields moderately. The star's kinematic behavior shows that the star has a retrograde orbit and is moving away from the galactic center and out of the galactic disk to the south, and although the star is located in the halo of the Milky Way, it didn't form in the Milky Way but was rather formed in a small dwarf galaxy that was later absorbed by the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 We constrain the angular momentum architecture of VHS J125601.92-125723.9, a 140 $\pm$ 20 Myr old hierarchical triple system composed of a low-mass binary and a widely-separated planetary-mass companion VHS 1256 b. VHS 1256 b has been a prime target for multiple characterization efforts, revealing the highest measured substellar photometric variability to date and the presence of silicate clouds and disequilibrium chemistry. Here we add a key piece to the characterization of this super-Jupiter on a Tatooine-like orbit; we measure its spin-axis tilt relative to its orbit, i.e. the obliquity of VHS 1256 b. We accomplish this by combining three measurements. We find a projected rotation rate $v \sin{i_p} = 8.7 \pm 0.1 \,\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ for VHS 1256 b using near-IR high-resolution spectra from Gemini/IGRINS. Combining this with a published photometric rotation period indicates that the companion is viewed edge-on, with a line-of-sight spin axis inclination of $i_{\rm p} = 90^\circ \pm 18^\circ$. We refit available astrometry measurements to confirm an orbital inclination of $i_{\rm o} = 23 \substack{+10 \\ -13}^\circ$. Taken together, VHS 1256 b has a large planetary obliquity of $\psi = 90^\circ \pm 25^\circ$. In total, we have three measured angular momentum vectors for the system: the binary orbit normal, companion orbit normal, and companion spin axis. All three are misaligned with respect to each other. Although VHS 1256 b is tilted like Uranus, their origins are distinct. We rule out planet-like scenarios including collisions and spin-orbit resonances, and suggest that top-down formation via core/filament fragmentation is promising.

          Extinction of Taurus, Orion, Perseus and California Molecular Clouds Based on the LAMOST, 2MASS, and Gaia Surveys II: The Extinction Law

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 The extinction law from ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR) (0.2-24 $\mu$m) is determined by relying on the blue-edge method and color excess ratios for some nearby molecular clouds, from low mass star forming region to massive star forming region. The observational data are collected from nine photometric surveys, along with stellar parameters from the APOGEE and LAMOST spectroscopic surveys. Within the uncertainties, the optical ratio of selective to total extinction ($R_{G_{BP}}$) does not vary substantially across the clouds, irrespective of the density, specifically $R_{G_{BP}} =2.302\pm0.027$, where $R_{G_{BP}} \equiv A_{G_{BP}}/E_{G_{BP},G_{RP}}$. The IR extinction law is consistent with \citet{Wang19_law}. The extinction law in the UV band is compromised by the shallow depth with $A_{V} \leq 2$ mag and is hard to describe by one parameter $R$. In addition, the extinction in the WISE/W1 band is significantly larger than in the Spitzer/IRAC1 band in the dense regions, which is attributed to the ice water absorption.
