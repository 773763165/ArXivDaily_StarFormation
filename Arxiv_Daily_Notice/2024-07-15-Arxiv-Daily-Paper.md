 - **Abstract**
 Large area observations of extragalactic deep fields with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have provided a wealth of candidate low-mass L- and T-class brown dwarfs. The existence of these sources, which are at derived distances of hundreds of parsecs to several kiloparsecs from the Sun, has strong implications for the low-mass end of the stellar initial mass function, and the link between stars and planets at low metallicities. In this letter, we present a JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectrum of brown dwarf JADES-GS-BD-9, confirming its photometric selection from observations taken as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. Fits to this spectrum indicate that the brown dwarf has an effective temperature of 800-900K (T5 - T6) at a distance of $1.8 - 2.3$kpc from the Sun, with evidence of the source being at low metallicity ([M/H] $\leq -0.5$). Finally, because of the cadence of JADES NIRCam observations of this source, we additionally uncover a proper motion between the 2022 and 2023 centroids, and we measure a proper motion of $20 \pm 4$ mas yr$^{-1}$ (a transverse velocity of 214 km s$^{-1}$ at 2.25 kpc). At this predicted metallicity, distance, and transverse velocity, it is likely that this source belongs either to the edge of the Milky Way thick disk or the galactic halo. This spectral confirmation demonstrates the efficacy of photometric selection of these important sources across deep extragalactic JWST imaging.

 - **Abstract**
 Nulling interferometry is a powerful observing technique to reach exoplanets and circumstellar dust at separations too small for direct imaging with single-dish telescopes and too large for indirect methods. With near-future instrumentation, it bears the potential to detect young, hot planets near the snow lines of their host stars. A future space mission could detect and characterize a large number of rocky, habitable-zone planets around nearby stars at thermal-infrared wavelengths. The null self-calibration is a method aiming at modelling the statistical distribution of the nulled signal. It has proven to be more sensitive and accurate than average-based data reduction methods in nulling interferometry. This statistical approach opens the possibility of designing a GPU-based Python package to reduce the data from any of these instruments, by simply providing the data and a simulator of the instrument. GRIP is a toolbox to reduce nulling and interferometric data based on the statistical self-calibration method. In this article, we present the main features of GRIP as well as applications on real data.

          Searching for Protoplanets around MWC 758 and MWC 480 in Br-$\gamma$ using Kernel Phase and SCExAO/CHARIS

 - **Abstract**
 Discovering new actively-accreting protoplanets is crucial to answering open questions about planet formation. However, identifying such planets at orbital distances where they are expected to be abundant is extremely challenging, both due to the technical requirements and large distances to star-forming regions. Here we use the kernel phase interferometry (KPI) technique to search for companions around the $\sim$6 and $\sim$8 Myr old Herbig Ae stars MWC 758 and MWC 480. KPI is a data analysis technique which is sensitive to moderate asymmetries, arising from eg. a circumstellar disk or companions with contrasts of up to 6-8 mags, at separations down to and even below the classical Rayleigh diffraction limit ($\sim 1.2\lambda / D$). Using the high spectral resolution K-band mode of the SCExAO/CHARIS integral field spectrograph, we search for both excess Br-$\gamma$ line emission and continuum emission from companions around MWC 480 and MWC 758. We are able to set limits on the presence of rapidly accreting protoplanets and brown dwarfs between 4 and 16 au, well interior to those of previous studies. In Br-$\gamma$, we set limits on excess line emission equivalent to accretion rates ranging from $10^{-5} M_{j}^{2}.yr^{-1}$ to $10^{-6}M_{j}^{2}.yr^{-1}$. Our achievable contrasts demonstrate that KPI using SCExAO/CHARIS is a promising technique to search for giant accreting protoplanets at smaller separations compared to conventional imaging.

 - **Abstract**
 The Solar eruptioN Integral Field Spectrograph (SNIFS) is a solar-gazing spectrograph scheduled to fly in the summer of 2025 on a NASA sounding rocket. Its goal is to view the solar chromosphere and transition region at a high cadence (1s) both spatially (0.5") and spectrally (33 mÅ) viewing wavelengths around Lyman Alpha (1216 Å), Si iii (1206 Å) and O v (1218 Å) to observe spicules, nanoflares, and possibly a solar flare. This time cadence will provide yet-unobserved detail about fast-changing features of the Sun. The instrument is comprised of a Gregorian-style reflecting telescope combined with a spectrograph via a specialized mirrorlet array that focuses the light from each spatial location in the image so that it may be spectrally dispersed without overlap from neighboring locations. This paper discusses the driving science, detailed instrument and subsystem design, and pre-integration testing of the SNIFS instrument.

 - **Abstract**
 HESS J1809-193 is an unidentified TeV source, first detected by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) Collaboration. The emission originates in a source-rich region that includes several Supernova Remnants (SNR) and Pulsars (PSR) including SNR G11.1+0.1, SNR G11.0-0.0, and the young radio pulsar J1809-1917. Originally classified as a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) candidate, recent studies show the peak of the TeV region overlapping with a system of molecular clouds. This resulted in the revision of the original leptonic scenario to look for alternate hadronic scenarios. Marked as a potential PeVatron candidate, this region has been studied extensively by H.E.S.S. due to its emission extending up-to several tens of TeV. In this work, we use 2398 days of data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory to carry out a systematic source search for the HESS J1809-193 region. We were able to resolve emission detected as an extended component (modelled as a Symmetric Gaussian with a 1 $\sigma$ radius of 0.21 $^\circ$) with no clear cutoff at high energies and emitting photons up-to 210 TeV. We model the multi-wavelength observations for the region HESS J1809-193 using a time-dependent leptonic model and a lepto-hadronic model. Our model indicates that both scenarios could explain the observed data within the region of HESS J1809-193.

 - **Abstract**
 Using an established classification technique, we leverage standard observations and analyses to predict the progenitors of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). This technique, utilizing support vector machine (SVM) statistics, provides a more nuanced prediction than the previous two-component Gaussian mixture in duration of the prompt gamma-ray emission. Based on further covariance testing from \textit{Fermi}-GBM, \textit{Swift}-BAT, and \textit{Swift}-XRT data, we find that our classification based only on prompt emission properties gives perspective on the recent evidence that mergers and collapsars exist in both long and short GRB populations.

          Unified description of corpuscular and fuzzy bosonic dark matter II: Dissipation and stochastic forces

 - **Abstract**
 We extend our previous work (Proukakis {\em et al.}, Phys.~Rev.~D~108,~083513 (2023)) on the dynamics of bosonic, non-relativistic and self-interacting dark matter that simultaneously contains both a ``fuzzy'' low-momentum component and one with higher momenta that may be well approximated as a collection of distinct particles and described by a corresponding phase-space distribution. Starting from the non-relativistic Schwinger-Keldysh action and working beyond leading-order in the Keldysh basis fields, encoding stochastic fluctuations of the slow modes and all fluctuations of the fast modes, we obtain stochastic self-consistently coupled Gross-Pitaevskii, collisional Boltzmann kinetic and Poisson equations. Our final set of equations, which feature various collisional (dissipative and scattering) contributions and two corresponding independent stochastic force terms, are consistent with generalized fluctuation-dissipation type relations in the limit of thermal equilibrium between the particles.

 - **Abstract**
 Front-end polarization modulation enables improved polarization measurement stability by modulating the targeted signal above the low-frequency $1/f$ drifts associated with atmospheric and instrumental instabilities and diminishes the impact of instrumental polarization. In this work, we present the design and characterization of a new 60-cm diameter Reflective Half-Wave Plate (RHWP) polarization modulator for the 90 GHz band telescope of the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) project. The RHWP consists of an array of parallel wires (diameter $50~\mathrm{\mu m}$, $175~\mathrm{\mu m}$ pitch) positioned $0.88~\mathrm{mm}$ from an aluminum mirror. In lab tests, it was confirmed that the wire resonance frequency ($f_\mathrm{res}$) profile is consistent with the target, $139~\mathrm{Hz}<f_\mathrm{res}<154~\mathrm{Hz}$ in the optically active region (diameter smaller than $150~\mathrm{mm}$), preventing the wire vibration during operation and reducing the RHWP deformation under the wire tension. The mirror tilt relative to the rotating axis was controlled to be $<15''$, corresponding to an increase in beam width due to beam smearing of $<0.6''$, negligible compared to the beam's full-width half-maximum of $36'$. The median and 16/84th percentile of the wire--mirror separation residual was $0.048^{+0.013}_{-0.014}~\mathrm{mm}$ in the optically active region, achieving a modulation efficiency $\epsilon=96.2_{+0.5}^{-0.4}\%$ with an estimated bandpass of 34 GHz. The angular velocity of the RHWP was maintained to an accuracy of within $0.005\%$ at the nominal rotation frequency ($2.5~\mathrm{Hz}$). The RHWP has been successfully integrated into the CLASS 90 GHz telescope and started taking data in June 2024, replacing the previous modulator that has been in operation since June 2018.

          Probing Cold-to-Temperate Exoplanetary Atmospheres: The Role of Water Condensation on Surface Identification with JWST

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the surface temperature and interior structure of cold-to-temperate sub-Neptunes is critical for assessing their habitability, yet direct observations are challenging. In this study, we investigate the impact of water condensation on the atmospheric compositions of sub-Neptunes, focusing on the implications for JWST spectroscopic observations. By modeling the atmospheric photochemistry of two canonical sub-Neptunes, K2-18 b and LHS 1140 b, both with and without water condensation and with and without thick atmospheres, we demonstrate that water condensation can significantly affect the predicted atmospheric compositions. This effect is driven by oxygen depletion from the condensation of water vapor and primarily manifests as an increase in the C/O ratio within the photochemically active regions of the atmosphere. This change in composition particularly affects planets with thin H$_2$-dominated atmospheres, leading to a transition in dominant nitrogen and carbon carriers from N$_2$ and oxygen-rich species like CO/CO$_2$ towards heavier hydrocarbons and nitriles. While our models do not fully account for the loss mechanisms of these higher-order species, such molecules can go on to form more refractory molecules or hazes. Planets with thin H2-rich atmospheres undergoing significant water condensation are thus likely to exhibit very hazy atmospheres. The relatively flat JWST spectra observed for LHS 1140 b could be consistent with such a scenario, suggesting a shallow surface with extensive water condensation or a high atmospheric C/O ratio. Conversely, the JWST observations of K2-18 b are better aligned with a volatile-rich mini-Neptune with a thick atmosphere.

          Hysteresis near the transition of the large-scale dynamo in the presence of the small-scale dynamo

 - **Abstract**
 In Sun and solar-type stars, there is a critical dynamo number for the operation of a large-scale dynamo, below which the dynamo ceases to operate. This region is known as the subcritical region. Previous studies showed the possibility of operating the solar-like large-scale (global) dynamo in the subcritical region without a small-scale dynamo. As in the solar convection zone, both large- and small-scale dynamos are expected to operate at the same time and location, we check the robustness of the previously identified subcritical dynamo branch in a numerical model in which both large- and small-scale dynamos are excited. For this, we use the {\sc Pencil Code} and set up an $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo model with uniform shear and helically forced turbulence. We have performed a few sets of simulations at different relative helicity to explore the generation of large-scale oscillatory fields in the presence of small-scale dynamo. We find that in some parameter regimes, the dynamo shows hysteresis behavior, i.e., two dynamo solutions are possible depending on the initial parameters used. A decaying solution when the dynamo was started with a weak field and a strong oscillatory solution if the dynamo was initialized with a strong field. Thus, the existence of the sub-critical branch of the large-scale dynamo in the presence of small-scale dynamo is established. However, the regime of hysteresis is quite narrow with respect to the case without the small-scale dynamo. Our work supports the possible existence of large-scale dynamo in the sub-critical regime of slowly rotating stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a silicon drift detector (SDD) system for the spectroscopy focusing array (SFA) of the enhanced X-ray timing and polarimetry (eXTP) mission. The SFA focuses on fast timing (time resolution below 10 {\mu}s) and good spectroscopy capabilities (energy resolution better than 180 eV @ 6 keV). The sensor, consisting of 19 hexagonally shaped pixels with a total sensitive area of ${5.05}\, cm^{2}$, is connected to three high time resolution spectroscopy (HTRS) ASICs, allowing a fast readout of the detector signals. The detector works in a Charge- Sensitive Amplifier configuration. We assembled a prototype detector module and present here its mechanical design, describe the used sensor, and report about its performance.

          The JWST Weather Report from the Nearest Brown Dwarfs I: multi-period JWST NIRSpec + MIRI monitoring of the benchmark binary brown dwarf WISE 1049AB

 - **Abstract**
 We report results from 8 hours of JWST/MIRI LRS spectroscopic monitoring directly followed by 7 hours of JWST/NIRSpec prism spectroscopic monitoring of the benchmark binary brown dwarf WISE 1049AB, the closest, brightest brown dwarfs known. We find water, methane, and CO absorption features in both components, including the 3.3 $\mu$m methane absorption feature and a tentative detection of small grain ($<$ 1$\mu$m) silicate absorption at $>$8.5 $\mu$m in WISE 1049A. Both components vary significantly ($>$1$\%$), with WISE 1049B displaying larger variations than WISE 1049A. Using K-means clustering, we find three main transition points in wavelength for both components of the binary: 1) change in behavior at $\sim$2.3 $\mu$m coincident with a CO absorption bandhead, 2) change in behavior at 4.2 $\mu$m, close to the CO fundamental band at $\lambda >$ 4.4 $\mu$m, and 3) change in behavior at 8.3-8.5 $\mu$m, potentially corresponding to silicate absorption. We interpret the lightcurves observed with both NIRSpec and MIRI as likely stemming from 1) a deep pressure level driving the double-peaked variability seen in WISE 1049B at wavelengths $<$2.3 $\mu$m and $>$8.5 $\mu$m, 2) an intermediate pressure level shaping the lightcurve morphology between 2.3 and 4.2 $\mu$m, and 3) a higher-altitude pressure level producing single-peaked and plateaued lightcurve behavior between 4.2 and 8.5 $\mu$m.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Helioseismic inversions rely largely on sensitivity kernels, 3-D spatial functions describing how do the changes in the solar interior translate into the changes of helioseismic observables. These sensitivity kernels come in most cases from the forward modelling utilising state-of-the-art solar models. Aims: We aim to test the sensitivity kernels by comparing their volume integrals with measured values from helioseismic travel times. Methods: By manipulating the tracking rate, we mimic the additional zonal velocity present in the Dopplergram datacubes. These datacubes are then processed by a standard travel-time measurements pipeline. We investigate the dependence of the east--west travel time averaged over a box around the disc centre on the implanted tracking velocity. The slope of this dependence is directly proportional to the total volume integral of the sensitivity kernel corresponding to the used travel-time geometry. Results: We find a very good to acceptable agreement between measurements and models for travel times with ridge filtering applied. The sought dependence indeed resembles a linear function and the slope of it agrees with the expected volume integral from the forward-modelled sensitivity kernel. The agreement is less optimistic for the phase-speed filtered datacubes. A disagreement is particularly large for smallest phase speeds (filters td1--td4), for the larger phase speeds, our result indicate that the measured kernel integrals are systematically larger than expected from the forward modelling. We admit that for large phase-speeds and higher radial modes our testing procedure does not have to be appropriate.

 - **Abstract**
 The highest scientific return, for adaptive optics (AO) observations, is achieved with a reliable reconstruction of the PSF. This is especially true for MICADO@ELT. In this presentation, we will focus on extending the MICADO PSF reconstruction (PSF-R) method to the off-axis case. Specifically, a novel approach based on temporal-based tomography of AO telemetry data has been recently implemented. Results from the PSF-R of both simulated and real data show that, at half isoplanatic angle distances, a precision of about 10-15% is achievable in both Strehl ratio and full-width at half maximum, paving the way to extend the MICADO PSF-R tool also to the multi-conjugated AO case.

          Skipping a beat: discovery of persistent quasi-periodic oscillations associated with pulsed fraction drop of the spin signal in M51 ULX-7

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of pulsations in (at least) six ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) has shown that neutron stars can accrete at (highly) super-Eddington rates, challenging the standard accretion theories. M51 ULX-7, with a spin signal of $P\simeq2.8$ s, is the pulsating ULX (PULX) with the shortest known orbital period ($P_\mathrm{orb}\simeq2$ d) and has been observed multiple times by XMM-Newton, Chandra, and NuSTAR. We report on the timing and spectral analyses of three XMM-Newton observations of M51 ULX-7 performed between the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022, together with a timing re-analysis of XMM-Newton, Chandra, and NuSTAR archival observations. We investigated the spin signal by applying accelerated search techniques and studied the power spectrum through the fast Fourier transform, looking for (a)periodic variability in the source flux. We analysed the energy spectra of the 2021-2022 observations and compared them to the older ones. We report the discovery of a recurrent, significant ($>$3$\sigma$) broad complex at mHz frequencies in the power spectra of M51 ULX-7. We did not detect the spin signal, setting a 3$\sigma$ upper limit on the pulsed fraction of $\lesssim10\%$ for the single observation. The complex is significantly detected also in five Chandra observations performed in 2012. M51 ULX-7 represents the second PULX for which we have a significant detection of mHz-QPOs at super-Eddington luminosities. These findings suggest that one should avoid using the observed QPO frequency to infer the mass of the accretor in a ULX. The absence of spin pulsations when the broad complex is detected suggests that the mechanism responsible for the aperiodic modulation also dampens the spin signal's pulsed fraction. If true, this represents an additional obstacle in the detection of new PULXs, suggesting an even larger occurrence of PULXs among ULXs.

          Clues on the nature of the quasi-periodic optical outbursts of the blazar OJ 287

 - **Abstract**
 The fascination with the blazar OJ 287 stems not only from its status as a prominent candidate for a close supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary, but also because of the thermal bremsstrahlung origin proposed for its giant optical outbursts. These outbursts arrive as pairs, quasi-periodically every $\sim 12$ years, based on the unique 130-year-long, well-sampled optical light curve available for this blazar. For its three well-known, large quasi-periodic optical outbursts (QPOOs), observed in 1983, 2007 and 2015, optical photo-polarimetric monitoring has been reported in the literature. For these initially radio-undetected QPOOs, widely acclaimed as `bremsstrahlung flares', we have scrutinised the available measurements of optical polarisation and spectral index during the rising phase. Several inconsistencies of these data with the optical bremsstrahlung interpretation are noted, which point towards a synchrotron-dominated alternative interpretation for all these prominent QPOOs, just as for the optical emission observed between the outbursts. Possible reasons for the radio non-detection of the QPOOs during the initial stage are outlined.

 With the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offering higher resolution data in space-based transmission spectroscopy, understanding the capabilities of our current atmospheric retrieval pipelines is essential. These new data cover wider wavelength ranges and at much higher spectral resolution than previous instruments have been able to offer. Therefore, it is often appealing to bin spectra to fewer points, better constrained in their transit depth, before using them as inputs for atmospheric retrievals. However, little quantitative analysis of the trade-off between spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio has been conducted thus far. As such, we produce a simulation replicating the observations of WASP-39b by the NIRSpec PRISM instrument on board JWST and assess the accuracy and consistency of retrievals while varying resolution and the average photometric error. While this probes a specific case we also plot `binning paths' in the resulting sensitivity maps to demonstrate the best attainable atmospheric parameter estimations starting from the position of the real JWST Early Release Science observation. We repeat this analysis on three different simulation setups where each includes an opaque cloud layer at a different height in the atmosphere. We find that a much greater resolution is needed in the case of a high cloud deck since features are already heavily muted by the presence of the clouds. In the other two cases, there are large `safe zones' in the parameter space. If these maps can be generalised, binning paths could inform future observations on how to achieve the most accurate retrieval results.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic disk is one of the main components of the Milky Way, which contributes most of the luminosity. Its structure is essential for understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. Using 174,443 K-type dwarf stars observed by both LAMOST and Gaia DR3, we study the disk density profile in the local volume within 1,200 pc. In the azimuthal dimension, we find strong asymmetric signal of the thin disk. The surface density and the scale height of the southern disk significantly change versus the azimuthal angle at the same galactocentric distance $R$. Meanwhile, in the vertical dimension, the scale height of the northern disk has quite different trend than that of the southern one. The scale height of the southern disk shows a decreasing trend with $\phi\sim-2.5^\circ$, and change to an increasing one with $\phi\sim5.0^°$. Meanwhile, the scale height of the northern disk has a consistently smaller increase. Finally, we divide the entire sample into three subsamples based on metallicity and all three subsamples show significant non-axisymmetric and north-south asymmetric signals in the Galactic disk. Furthermore, we find that the scale height of the metal-poor ([Fe/H] $<$ -0.4 dex) subsample in the northern disk is greater than that of the metal-rich ([Fe/H] $>$ -0.1 dex) subsample. However, in the southern disk, the scale height exhibits varying relationships across different metallicity slices.

 - **Abstract**
 Linking atmospheric measurements to the bulk planetary composition and ultimately the planetary origin is a key objective in planetary science. In this work we identify the cases in which the atmospheric composition represents the bulk composition. We simulate the evolution of giant planets considering a wide range of planetary masses ($0.3-2~M_\mathrm{J}$), initial entropies ($8-11~k_\mathrm{B} m_\mathrm{u}^{-1}$), and primordial heavy-element profiles. We find that convective mixing is most efficient at early times (ages $\lesssim 10^7$ years) and that primordial composition gradients can be eroded. In several cases, however, the atmospheric composition can differ widely from the planetary bulk composition, with the exact outcome depending on the details. We show that the efficiency of convection is primarily controlled by the underlying entropy profile: for low primordial entropies of $8-9~k_\mathrm{B} m_\mathrm{u}^{-1}$ convective mixing can be inhibited and composition gradients can persist over billions of years. The scaling of mixing efficiency with mass is governed by the primordial entropy. For the same primordial entropy, low-mass planets mix more efficiently than high mass planets. If the primordial internal entropy would increase with mass, however, this trend could reverse. We also present a new analytical model that predicts convective mixing under the existence of composition (and entropy) gradients. Our results emphasize the complexity in the interpretation of atmospheric abundance measurements and show the great need to better understand the planetary formation process as it plays a key role in determining the planetary evolution and final structure.

 - **Abstract**
 The Synthetic Corona Outflow Model (SynCOM), an empirical model, simulates the solar corona's dynamics to match high-resolution observations, providing a useful resource for testing velocity measurement algorithms. SynCOM generates synthetic images depicting radial variability in polarized brightness and includes stochastic elements for plasma outflows and instrumental noise. It employs a predefined flow velocity probability distribution and an adjustable signal-to-noise ratio to evaluate different data analysis methods for coronal flows. By adjusting parameters to match specific coronal and instrumental conditions, SynCOM offers a platform to assess these methods for determining coronal velocity and acceleration. Validating these measurements would help to understand solar wind origins and support missions such as the Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH). In this study, we demonstrate how SynCOM can be employed to assess the precision and performance of two different flow tracking methods. By providing a ground-truth based on observational data, we highlight the importance of SynCOM in confirming observational standards for detecting coronal flows.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine Saturn's non-auroral (dayglow) emissions at Lyman-$\alpha$ observed by the {Cassini/UVIS} instrument from 2004 until 2016, to constrain meridional and seasonal trends in the upper atmosphere. We separate viewing geometry effects from trends driven by atmospheric properties, by applying a multi-variate regression to the observed emissions. The Lyman-$\alpha$ dayglow brightnesses depend on the incident solar flux, solar incidence angle, emission angle, and observed latitude. The emissions across latitudes and seasons show a strong dependence with solar incidence angle, typical of resonantly scattered solar flux and consistent with no significant internal source. We observe a bulge in Ly-$\alpha$ brightness that shifts with the summer season from the southern to the northern hemisphere. We estimate atomic hydrogen optical depths above the methane homopause level for dayside disk observations (2004-2016) by comparing observed Lyman-$\alpha$ emissions to a radiative transfer model. We model emissions from resonantly scattered solar flux and a smaller but significant contribution by scattered photons from the interplanetary hydrogen (IPH) background. During northern summer, inferred hydrogen optical depths steeply decrease with latitude towards the winter hemisphere from a northern hemisphere bulge, as predicted by a 2D seasonal photochemical model. The southern hemisphere mirrors this trend during its summer. However, inferred optical depths show substantially more temporal variation between 2004 and 2016 than predicted by the photochemical model.

 - **Abstract**
 Computation of a grid of self consistent 1D model atmospheres of cool stars, sub-stellar objects and exoplanets in the effective temperature range 300K to 3000K, including cloud formation, chemical non-equilibrium effects, and stellar irradiation. The models are called MSG, because they are based on an iterative coupling between three well tested codes, the MARCS stellar atmosphere code, the StaticWeather cloud formation code and the GGchem chemical equilibrium code. It includes up-to-date molecular and atomic opacities, cloud formation and advanced chemical equilibrium calculations, and involves new numerical methods at low temperatures to allow robust convergence. The coupling between the MARCS radiative transfer and GGchem chemical equilibrium computations has made it possibly effectively to reach convergence based on electron pressure for the warmer models and gas pressure for the cooler models, enabling self-consistent modelling of stellar, sub-stellar and exoplanetary objects in a very wide range of effective temperatures. Here we describe the basic details of the models, with illustrative examples of cloudy and irradiated models as well as models based on non-equilibrium chemistry. The qualitative changes in the relative abundances of TiO, H2O, CH4, NH3, and other molecules in our models follow the observationally defined M, L, T (and Y) sequences, but reveal more complex and depth dependent abundance changes, and therefore a spectral classification depending on more parameters. The self consistent coupling to Static-Weather cloud computations, allows detailed comparison between nucleation and observed relative dimming of different spectral bands, with advanced applications for new identification methods of potential exoplanetary biology.

 - **Abstract**
 The standard cosmological model, which assumes statistical isotropy and parity invariance, predicts the absence of correlations between even-parity and odd-parity observables of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Contrary to these predictions, large-angle CMB temperature anomalies generically involve correlations between even-$\ell$ and odd-$\ell$ angular power spectrum $C_\ell$, while recent analyses of CMB polarization have revealed non-zero equal-$\ell$ $EB$ correlations. These findings challenge the conventional understanding, suggesting deviations from statistical isotropy, violations of parity, or both. Cosmic topology, which involves changing only the boundary conditions of space relative to standard cosmology, offers a compelling framework to potentially account for such parity-violating observations. Topology inherently breaks statistical isotropy, and can also break homogeneity and parity, providing a natural paradigm for explaining observations of parity-breaking observables without the need to add parity violation to the underlying microphysics. Our investigation delves into the harmonic space implications of topology for CMB correlations, using as an illustrative example $EB$ correlations generated by tensor perturbations under both parity-preserving and parity-violating scenarios. Consequently, these findings not only challenge the foundational assumptions of the standard cosmological model but also open new avenues for exploring the topological structure of the Universe through CMB observations.

          Inflationary Initial Conditions for the Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background

 - **Abstract**
 The initial conditions on the anisotropies of the stochastic gravitational-wave background of cosmological origin (CGWB) largely depend on the mechanism that generates the gravitational waves. Since the CGWB is expected to be non-thermal, the computation of the initial conditions could be more challenging w.r.t. the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), whose interactions with other particles in the early Universe lead to a blackbody spectrum. In this paper, we show that the initial conditions for the cosmological background generated by quantum fluctuations of the metric during inflation deviate from adiabaticity. These primordial gravitational waves are indeed generated by quantum fluctuations of two independent degrees of freedom (the two polarization states of the gravitons). Furthermore, the CGWB plays a negligible role in the Einstein's equations, because its energy density is subdominant w.r.t. ordinary matter. Therefore, the only possible way to compute the initial conditions for inflationary gravitons is to perturb the energy-momentum tensor of the gravitational field defined in terms of the small-scale tensor perturbation of the metric. This new and self-consistent approach shows that a large, non-adiabatic initial condition is present even during the single-field inflation. Such a contribution enhances the total angular power spectrum of the CGWB compared to the standard adiabatic case, increasing also the sensitivity of the anisotropies to the presence of relativistic and decoupled particles in the early Universe. In this work we have also proved that our findings are quite general and apply to both single-field inflation and other scenarios in which the CGWB is generated by the quantum fluctuations of the metric, like the curvaton.

          Exploring Galactic open clusters with Gaia I. An examination in the first kiloparsec

 Context. Since the first publication of the Gaia catalogue a new view of our Galaxy has arrived. Its astrometric and photometric information has improved the precision of the physical parameters of open star clusters obtained from them. Aims. Using the Gaia DR3 catalogue, we aim to find physical stellar members including faint stars for 370 Galactic open clusters located within 1 kpc. We also estimate the age, metallicity, distance modulus and extinction of these clusters. Methods. We employ the HDBSCAN algorithm on both astrometric and photometric data to identify members in the open clusters. Subsequently, we refine the samples by eliminating outliers through the application of the Mahalanobis metric utilizing the chi-square distribution at a confidence level of 95%. Furthermore, we characterize the stellar parameters with the PARSEC isochrones. Results. We obtain reliable star members for 370 open clusters with an average parallax error of 0.16 mas. We identify about 40% more stars in these clusters compared to previous work using the Gaia DR2 catalogue, including faint stars as new members with G > 17. Before the clustering application we correct the parallax zero-point bias to avoid spatial distribution stretching that may affect clustering results. Our membership lists include merging stars identified by HDBSCAN with astrometry and photometry. We note that the use of photometry in clustering can recover up to 10% more stars in the fainter limit than clustering based on astrometry only, this combined with the selection of stars filtering them out by quality cuts significantly reduces the number of stars with huge parallax error. After clustering, we estimate age, Z, and AV from the photometry of the membership lists.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of the observational study of the blazar S5 0716+716 in the optical bands B, V, R, and I between March 2019 and August 2023 to investigate its variability on diverse time-scales. The blazar was followed up by the T60 robotic telescope in Turkey for 416 nights to obtain long-term variability during this period. In order to search for intraday variability of the object, we have carried out 21 nights of observations with the T100 telescope for at least 1 hour. The blazar showed a ~2.47 mag variation in the optical R-band during our monitoring period, the brightest state on 18.01.2020 (MJD 58866) as R=12.109$\pm$0.011 and the faintest state on 23.03.2019 (MJD 58565) as R=14.580$\pm$0.013. We employed the nested ANOVA test and the power enhanced F-test to quantify intraday variability which showed that the blazar was significantly variable in the R-band on 12 out of 21 nights. Correlation analysis of the light curves shows that the emission in the BVRI optical bands was strongly correlated both in the short and long term without any time lag. The blazar has likely quasi-periods of 186$\pm$30, 532$\pm$76 days in the optical R-band light curve according to the WWZ, and the LS periodogram. The IDV and LTV features are discussed within the frame of prospective scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a flow-based generative approach to emulate grids of stellar evolutionary models. By interpreting the input parameters and output properties of these models as multi-dimensional probability distributions, we train conditional normalizing flows to learn and predict the complex relationships between grid inputs and outputs in the form of conditional joint distributions. Leveraging the expressive power and versatility of these flows, we showcase their ability to emulate a variety of evolutionary tracks and isochrones across a continuous range of input parameters. In addition, we describe a simple Bayesian approach for estimating stellar parameters using these flows and demonstrate its application to asteroseismic datasets of red giants observed by the Kepler mission. By applying this approach to red giants in open clusters NGC 6791 and NGC 6819, we illustrate how large age uncertainties can arise when fitting only to global asteroseismic and spectroscopic parameters without prior information on initial helium abundances and mixing length parameter values. We also conduct inference using the flow at a large scale by determining revised estimates of masses and radii for 15,388 field red giants. These estimates show improved agreement with results from existing grid-based modelling, reveal distinct population-level features in the red clump, and suggest that the masses of Kepler red giants previously determined using the corrected asteroseismic scaling relations have been overestimated by 5-10%.

 - **Abstract**
 By taking into account the latest observations and theoretical constraints, we investigate the merger and post-merger of binary neutron stars (NSs) with numerical simulations employing hadronic and hybrid equations of state (EOSs). We name our hybrid stars Neutron-quark stars (NQS), because the transition from hadrons to quarks starts at a density lower than the central density of $\sim 1 M_{\odot}$ stars. The two scenarios of transition to quark matter, a strong first-order phase transition (1PT) or a crossover, feature either a drop to almost zero or a rapid increase (peak) in the square of the sound speed $c_s^2$, implying a softening or stiffening during the transition, respectively. Although the properties of NQSs in equilibrium may not be distinguishable from those of NSs, we find that the post-merger gravitational-wave (GW) main frequency $f_2$ for the crossover scenario is generally lower than that of hadronic models with the same tidal deformability, indicating that a crossover transition is in principle observable when both the inspiral and post-merger signals are detected. Since it is viable according to current multi-messenger constraints, we also consider an EOS with a 1PT taking place at 1.8 times the nuclear saturation density ($n_0$), with a stiff quark EOS ($c_s^2 = 2/3~c^2$) after the transition. It is the first time that such a binary merger is studied numerically in full general relativity. Although its $f_2$ is $\sim 300$ Hz higher than that of its baseline, the relation between $f_2$ and the tidal deformability of inspiralling stars is close to that for hadronic EOSs.
