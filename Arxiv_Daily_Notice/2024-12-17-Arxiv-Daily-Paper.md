#### Title:
          Milky Way dark matter distribution or MOND test from vertical stellar kinematics with Gaia DR3

 - **Abstract**
 Vertical stellar kinematics+density can be used to trace the dark matter distribution [or the equivalent phantom mass in a Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) scenario] through Jeans equations. In this paper, we want to improve this type of analysis by making use of the recent data of the 6D information from the Gaia-DR3 survey in the anticenter and the Galactic poles to obtain the dynamical mass distribution near plane regions, including extended kinematics over a wide region of 8 kpc$<R<$22 kpc, $|z|<3$ kpc. Our conclusions are as follows: (i) the model of the spherical dark matter halos and the MOND model are compatible with the data; (ii) the model of the disky dark matter (with density proportional to the gas density) is excluded; (iii) the total lack of dark matter (there is only visible matter) within Newtonian gravity is compatible with the data; for instance, at solar Galactocentric radius, we obtained $\Sigma=39\pm 18$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ for $z=1.05$ kpc, compatible with the expected value for visible matter alone of 44 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$, thus allowing zero dark matter. Similarly, for $R>R_\odot$, $z=1.05$ kpc: $\Sigma=28.7\pm 9.6$, $23.0\pm 5.7$, $16.9\pm 5.8$, $11.4\pm 6.6$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$, respectively, for $R=10,13,16,19$ kpc, compatible with visible matter alone. Larger error bars in comparison with previous works are not due to worse data or a more awkward technique but to a stricter modeling of the stellar distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of a planetary microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-1609. The planetary anomaly was detected by two survey telescopes, OGLE and MOA. Each of these surveys collected enough data over the planetary anomaly to allow for an unambiguous planet detection. Such survey detections of planetary anomalies are needed to build a robust sample of planets that could improve studies on the microlensing planetary occurrence rate by reducing biases and statistical uncertainties. In this work, we examined different methods for modeling microlensing events using individual datasets, particularly we incorporated a Galactic model prior to better constrain poorly defined microlensing parallax. Ultimately, we fitted a comprehensive model to all available data, identifying three potential typologies, with two showing comparably high Bayesian evidence. Our analysis indicates that the host of the planet is a brown dwarf with a probability of 34%, or a low-mass stellar object (M-dwarf) with the probability of 66%.

 - **Abstract**
 A better understanding of the ice-ocean couplings is required to better characterise the hydrosphere of the icy moons. Using global numerical simulations in spherical geometry, we have investigated here the interplay between rotating convection and a melting boundary. To do so, we have implemented and validated a phase field formulation in the open-source code \texttt{MagIC}. We have conducted a parameter study varying the influence of rotation, the vigour of the convective forcing and the melting temperature. We have evidenced different regimes akin to those already found in previous monophasic models in which the mean axisymmetric ice crust transits from pole-ward thinning to equator-ward thinning with the increase of the rotational constraint on the flow. The derivation of a perturbative model of heat conduction in the ice layer enabled us to relate those mean topographic changes to the underlying latitudinal heat flux variations at the top of the ocean. The phase change has also been found to yield the formation of sizeable non-axisymmetric topography at the solid-liquid interface with a typical size close to that of the convective columns. We have shown that the typical evolution timescale of the interface increases linearly with the crest-to-trough amplitude and quadratically with the mean melt radius. In the case of the largest topographic changes, the convective flows become quasi locked in the topography due to the constructive coupling between convection and ice melting. The tentative extrapolation to the planetary regimes yields $\mathcal{O}(10^2-10^3)$ meters for the amplitude of non-axisymmetric topography at the base of the ice layer of Enceladus and $\mathcal{O}(10^3-10^4)$ meters for Titan.

 - **Abstract**
 The first generation of transiting planet searches in globular clusters yielded no detections, and in hindsight, only placed occurrence rate limits slightly higher than the measured occurrence rate in the higher-metallicity Galactic thick disk. To improve these limits, we present the first results of a new wide field search for transiting hot Jupiters in the globular cluster 47~Tucanae. We have observed 47~Tuc as part of the Multiband Imaging Survey for High-Alpha Planets (MISHAPS). Using 24 partial and full nights of observations taken with the Dark Energy Camera on the 4-m Blanco telescope at CTIO, we perform a search on 19,930 stars in the outer regions of the cluster. Though we find no clear planet detections, by combining our result with the upper limit enabled by Gilliland et al.'s 2000 Hubble search for planets around an independent sample of 34,091 stars in the inner cluster, we place the strongest limit to date on hot Jupiters with periods of $0.8 \leq P \leq 8.3$ days and $0.5~R_{\rm Jup} \leq R_{\rm P} \leq 2.0~R_{\rm Jup}$ of $f_{\rm HJ} < 0.11\%$, a factor of ${\sim}$4 below the occurrence rate in the \textit{Kepler} field. Our search found 35 transiting planet candidates, though we are ultimately able to rule out each without follow-up observations. We also found 4 eclipsing binaries, including 3 previously-uncataloged detached eclipsing binary stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are excellent probes of the high-redshift Universe due to their high luminosities and the relatively simple intrinsic spectra of their afterglows. They can be used to estimate the fraction of neutral hydrogen (i.e., neutral fraction) in the intergalactic medium at different redshifts through the examination of their Lyman-alpha damping wing with high quality optical-to-near-infrared spectra. Neutral fraction estimates can help trace the evolution of the Epoch of Reionization, a key era of cosmological history in which the intergalactic medium underwent a phase change from neutral to ionized. We revisit GRB 130606A, a z ~ 5.9 GRB for which multiple analyses, using the same damping wing model and data from different telescopes, found conflicting neutral fraction results. We identify the source of the discrepant results to be differences in assumptions for key damping wing model parameters and data range selections. We perform a new analysis implementing multiple GRB damping wing models and find a 3-sigma neutral fraction upper limit ranging from xHI < 0.20 to xHI < 0.23. We present this result in the context of other neutral fraction estimates and Epoch of Reionization models, discuss the impact of relying on individual GRB lines of sight, and highlight the need for more high-redshift GRBs to effectively constrain the progression of the Epoch of Reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 Constraining the helium enhancement in stars is critical for understanding the formation mechanisms of multiple populations in star clusters. However, measuring helium variations for many stars within a cluster remains observationally challenging. We use Hubble Space Telescope photometry combined with MUSE spectroscopic data for over 7,200 red-giant branch stars in \omc\ to measure helium differences between distinct groups of stars as a function of metallicity separating the impact of helium enhancements from other abundance variations on the pseudo-color (chromosome) diagrams. Our results show that stars at all metallicities have subpopulations with significant helium enhancement ($\Delta Y_{min} \gtrsim$ 0.11). We find a rapid increase in helium enhancement from low metallicities ($\rm{[Fe/H] \simeq -2.05}$ to $\rm{[Fe/H] \simeq -1.92})$, with this enhancement leveling out at \deltay\ $= 0.154$ at higher metallicities. The fraction of helium-enhanced stars steadily increases with metallicity ranging from 10\% at $\rm{[Fe/H] \simeq -2.04}$ to over $90\%$ at $\rm{[Fe/H] \simeq -1.04}$. This study is the first to examine helium enhancement across the full range of metallicities in \omc{}, providing new insight into its formation history and additional constraints on enrichment mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Broadband spectroscopic observations with high sensitivity provide an unbiased way to detect emissions of molecules in space. We present deep observations from ~ 105.8 GHz to 113.6 GHz toward 50 Galactic massive star-forming regions using IRAM 30-m millimeter telescope, with noise levels ranging from 6 to 29 at frequency channel spacing of 195 kHz, which corresponds to ~ 0.54 km/s at 110 GHz. Totally, 27 molecular species have been identified, of which 16 are complex organic molecules. The related parameters, such as peak temperature, integrated intensity, and line width of the identified molecular lines were obtained. The line widths of the chemically related molecules show strong positive correlations, suggesting they likely originate from similar gases within star-forming regions. This work highlights the fundamental properties of the detected molecular lines and offers a valuable dataset for further studies on the astrochemical evolution of molecules in massive star-forming cores.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the efficacy of a systematic planetary nebula (PN) search in the Census of the Local Universe (CLU) narrowband (H$\alpha$) survey that covers a considerably larger sky region of above declination $-20^\circ$ than most previous surveys. Using PNe observed by the Isaac Newton Telescope Photometric H$\alpha$ Survey (IPHAS) as validation, we are able to visually recover 432 out of 441 cataloged PNe (98\%) within the CLU dataset, with 5 sources having unusable CLU images and 4 missed due to limitations of imaging quality. Moreover, the reference PNe are conventionally divided into three PN classes in decreasing order of identification confidence given their spectra and morphologies. We record consistently high recovery rate across all classes: 95\% of True, 71\% of Likely, and 81\% of Possible sources are readily recovered. To further demonstrate the ability of CLU to find new PNe, we undertake a preliminary search of compact PNe within a sub-region of the validation catalog, mainly utilizing the significance of narrow-band colors ($\Sigma$) as a metric for identification. In a $200\,\rm deg^2$ region, we search the CLU source catalog and find 31 PN candidates after automated and visual scrutiny, of which 12 are new sources not appearing in previous studies. As a demonstration of our ongoing follow-up campaign, we present medium-resolution optical spectra of six candidates and notice that four of them show emission signatures characteristic of confirmed PNe. As we refine our selection methods, CLU promises to provide a systematic catalog of PNe spanning $2/3$ of the sky.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave (GW) detection and analysis rely heavily on efficient Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) computation, a critical parameter for identifying and characterizing astrophysical signals from detectors like LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. The gwsnr Python package addresses the computational challenges in GW research by providing a flexible, user-friendly framework for SNR calculations. It supports diverse detector noise models, waveform approximants, detector configurations, and signal parameters, making it highly adaptable to various research needs. The package introduces innovative methods, including a partial-scaling interpolation technique for spin-less binary systems, a noise-weighted inner product approach with multiprocessing capabilities, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for rapid detection probability estimation of precessing binary black hole systems. Performance is further optimized using numba's Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, enabling significant reductions in execution time. Seamlessly integrating with other tools, such as the ler package, gwsnr is instrumental in simulating detectable compact binary mergers, estimating GW event rates, and analyzing selection effects in hierarchical Bayesian frameworks. This comprehensive toolkit empowers researchers to conduct efficient, precise, and scalable analyses of GW signals.

          Mass-transferring binary stars as progenitors of interacting hydrogen-free supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Stripped-envelope supernovae (SNe) are H-poor transients produced at the end of the life of massive stars that previously lost their H-rich envelope. Their progenitors are thought to be donor stars in mass-transferring binary systems, which were stripped of their H-rich envelopes some $10^6$yr before core collapse. A subset of the stripped-envelope SNe exhibit spectral and photometric features indicative of interaction between their ejecta and nearby circumstellar material (CSM). We examine whether mass transfer during, or shortly before, core collapse in massive binary systems can produce the CSM inferred from the observations of interacting H-poor SNe. We select 44 models from a comprehensive grid of detailed binary evolution models in which the mass donors are H-free and explode while transferring mass to a main-sequence companion. We find that in these models, mass transfer starts less than $\sim20$kyr before, and often continues until the core collapse of the donor star. Up to $0.8M_\odot$ of H-free material are removed from the donor star during this phase, which may produce a He-rich circumbinary material. We explore plausible assumptions for its spatial distribution at the time of explosion. When assuming that the CSM accumulates in a circumbinary disk, we find qualitative agreement with the supernova and CSM properties inferred from observed Type Ibn SNe, and to a lesser extent with constraints from Type Icn SNe. We find that our mass transferring stripped envelope SN progenitor models may produce up to $\sim$10% of all stripped envelope supernovae. The binary channel proposed in this work can qualitatively account for the observed key properties and rate of interacting H-poor SNe. Models for the evolution of the circumbinary material and the spectral evolution of exploding progenitors from this channel are needed to further test its significance.

          Deciphering the Soliton-Halo Relation in Fuzzy Dark Matter

 - **Abstract**
 Soliton cores at the center of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos provide a promising way to distinguish FDM from other dark matter models. However, the relation between solitons and their host halos remains contentious. Here, we rigorously examine this soliton-halo relation (SHR) using a rich set of cosmological simulations across various FDM particle masses, halo masses, and redshifts. We explicitly demonstrate thermal equilibrium between solitons and surrounding halo granules, energy equipartition within halos, and an FDM concentration-mass-nonisothermality relation. For each FDM halo, we confirm that its density profile outside the central soliton matches a collisionless N-body simulation from the same initial condition, serving as stringent numerical convergence tests. Our refined SHR agrees well with virialized halos in simulations, with a $1\sigma$ deviation of less than $30\%$. These findings not only reaffirm the SHR proposed by Schive et al. (2014) but also offer a more comprehensive understanding that extends its applicability. The simulation code GAMER is accessible at this https URL. A Python script for computing the theoretical SHR is available at this https URL.

          Vertical Shear Instability in Thermally-Stratified Protoplanetary Disks: I. A Linear Stability Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 Vertical shear instability (VSI), driven by a vertical gradient of rotational angular velocity, is a promising source of turbulence in protoplanetary disks. We examine the semi-global stability of thermally stratified disks and find that the VSI consists of surface and body modes: surface modes are confined to regions of strong shear, while body modes extend perturbations across the disk, consistent with the previous findings. In thermally stratified disks, surface modes bifurcate into two branches. The branch associated with the strongest shear at mid-height exhibits a higher growth rate compared to the branch near the surfaces. Surface modes generally grow rapidly and require a high radial wave number $k_R$, whereas body mode growth rates increase as $k_R$ decreases. Thermal stratification enhances the growth rates of both surface and body modes and boosts VSI-driven radial kinetic energy relative to vertical energy. Our results suggest that simulations will initially favor surface modes with large $k_R$, followed by an increase in body modes with smaller $k_R$, with faster progression in more thermal stratified disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Anisotropic stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) serves as a potential probe of the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. In this work, we explore the anisotropic SGWB from local ($z < \sim 0.085$) merging stellar mass compact binaries, specifically focusing on merging stellar binary black holes, merging neutron-star-black-hole binaries, and merging binary neutron stars. The analysis employs seven all-sky mock lightcone gravitational wave event catalogues, which are derived from the Millennium simulation combined with a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation and a binary population synthesis model. We calculate the angular power spectra $\mathrm{C}_\ell$ at multipole moments $\ell$, expressed as $\text{log}_{10} [\ell(\ell+1)\mathrm{C}_\ell/(2\pi)]$, based on the skymaps of the overdensity $\delta_\mathrm{GW}$ in the anisotropic SGWB. The spectra for all three source types exhibit an approximately linear increase with $\text{log}_{10} \ell$ at higher $\ell$ (e.g., $\ell > \sim 30 - 300$) in seven catalogues, with a characteristic slope of $\sim 2$. The spectra of seven catalogues exhibit considerable variations, arising from fluctuations in spatial distribution, primarily in the radial distribution, of nearby sources (e.g., $< 50$ Mpc/h). After subtracting these nearby sources, the variations become much smaller and the spectra for the three source types become closely aligned (within discrepancies of a factor of $\sim 2$ across $\ell = 1 - 1000$ for all catalogues).

 - **Abstract**
 This study employs a novel approach for reconstructing the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect power spectrum from Planck data using the Analytical Blind Separation (ABS) method. The ABS method improves the recovery of weak signals, by applying eigenmode exclusion for low signal-to-noise ratio regimes and introducing a shift parameter to stabilize calculations. Validation through simulated Planck data demonstrates the robustness of ABS in reconstructing the tSZ power spectrum, even under challenging conditions. In the analysis of the Planck PR3 full-mission data, ABS shows lower amplitudes at $\ell \gtrsim 300$ compared to the Planck 2015 band powers using the MILCA and NILC foreground cleaning methods. After marginalizing over residual foreground components, the ABS analysis finds the overall tSZ power spectrum amplitude to be 20\% lower than the Planck best-fit one, suggesting a smaller $S_8$. At $\ell \simeq 200$, the tSZ band power is $10^{12} \ell(\ell+1)C^{yy}_\ell/(2\pi) = 0.126\pm 0.018$, largely independent of the tSZ model choice. These findings highlight the potential of the ABS method as a promising alternative for tSZ power spectrum analysis, offering a robust and independent means of extracting cosmological parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the absorption of a gamma-ray burst afterglow in a dense molecular cloud in the X-ray wavelength range. We report the results of numerical simulations of the propagation of the gamma-ray burst radiation in the cloud for various gas densities, metallicities, and distances from the gamma-ray burst progenitor star and the cloud. We consider a sample of 45 gamma-ray bursts with known redshifts in which the isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray energy is approximately equal to the value adopted in our numerical simulations. For these gamma-ray bursts, we have analyzed the Swift/XRT energy spectra of their afterglows at late times, $t \geq 4 \times 10^3$ s. It is shown that the hydrogen column densities estimated using the absorption model in which the ionization of metal ions is not taken into account and the solar metallicity is used are a factor of 1-3 smaller than the actual values - if the molecular cloud is located close to the gamma-ray burst progenitor star. If the gas-dust cloud is located at a distance of $R \geq 10$ pc from the source of the gamma-ray burst or the gas metallicity is $[M/H] \leq -1$, then the effect of the cloud ionization structure on the absorption of the afterglow is minor.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The characterization of exoplanets requires a good description of the host star. Stellar activity acts as a source of noise which can alter planet radii as derived from the transit depth or atmospheric characterization. Aims. Here, we propose PAStar, a model to describe photospheric activity in the form of spots and faculae which could be applied to a wide range of stellar observations, from photometric to spectroscopic time series, to be able to correctly extract planetary and stellar properties. Methods. The adopted stellar atmosphere is a combination of three components, the quiet photosphere, spots and faculae. The model takes into account the effects of star inclination, doppler shifts due to stellar rotation as well as for limb darkening, independent for each component. Several synthetic products have been presented to show the capabilities of the model. Results. The model is able to retrieve the input surface inhomogeneities configuration through photometric or spectroscopic observations. The model has been validated against optical solar data and compared to alternative stellar surface activity models; e.g. SOAP code. The Sun is a unique laboratory to test stellar models because of the possibility to relate unambiguously flux variations to surface inhomogeneities configuration. This validation has been done by analyzing a photometric time series from the VIRGO photometer on board of SOHO mission. Results have been compared to real solar images from the HMI instrument on board of SDO to confirm the goodness of the results in terms of surface inhomogeneities position and dimensions. Conclusions. The description of stellar activity is a fundamental step in several astrophysical contexts and it is covered by the method we have presented. Our model offers a flexible and valuable tool to describe the activity of stars when it is dominated by spots and faculae.

 The popularity of the CLEAN algorithm in radio interferometric imaging stems from its maturity, speed, and robustness. While many alternatives have been proposed in the literature, none have achieved mainstream adoption by astronomers working with data from interferometric arrays operating in the big data regime. This lack of adoption is largely due to increased computational complexity, absence of mature implementations, and the need for astronomers to tune obscure algorithmic parameters. This work introduces pfb-imaging: a flexible library that implements the scaffolding required to develop and accelerate general radio interferometric imaging algorithms. We demonstrate how the framework can be used to implement a sparsity-based image reconstruction technique known as (unconstrained) SARA in a way that scales with image size rather than data volume and features interpretable algorithmic parameters. The implementation is validated on terabyte-sized data from the MeerKAT telescope, using both a single compute node and Amazon Web Services computing instances.

 - **Abstract**
 Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing research by enabling the efficient analysis of large datasets and the discovery of hidden patterns. In astrophysics, AI has become essential, transforming the classification of celestial sources, data modeling, and the interpretation of observations. In this review, I highlight examples of AI applications in astrophysics, including source classification, spectral energy distribution modeling, and discuss the advancements achievable through generative AI. However, the use of AI introduces challenges, including biases, errors, and the "black box" nature of AI models, which must be resolved before their application. These issues can be addressed through the concept of Human-Guided AI (HG-AI), which integrates human expertise and domain-specific knowledge into AI applications. This approach aims to ensure that AI is applied in a robust, interpretable, and ethical manner, leading to deeper insights and fostering scientific excellence.

 - **Abstract**
 The pCam6060 photodetecting system was developed at SAO RAS and is based on the GSENSE6060BSI photodetector manufactured by GPixel (China) with a frame format of 6144x6144 active pixels and a pixel size of 10 mkm. The readout speed reached 11 fps. The back-illuminated detector has a wide spectral range of 200-1040 nm with a minimum quantum efficiency (QE) of 10% and maximum sensitivity of 95% at 580 nm. The quantum efficiency in the near-infrared range was 58% at 850 nm. The pCam6060 system controller implements a mode of simultaneous image readout via two 12-bit video channels with different gain and their subsequent combination in the controller into a single frame with an extended 16-bit dynamic range. This method simultaneously achieves a low readout noise level (about 3 e-) in the high-gain channel and a large dynamic range (full well capacity of about 100000 e-) in the low-gain channel. Back-illuminated CMOS detectors, unlike front-illuminated devices, do not have the effect of long-term preserving the residual charge from previous exposures, which makes them suitable for recording faint objects in photometric long-exposure observation methods. Communication between the host computer and the camera was carried out via a fiber optic line at distances of up to 50 m. Video data are recorded on the computer hard drive in real-time. The pCam6060 photodetecting system is designed for astronomical applications and has a moisture-proof design.

 - **Abstract**
 Bayesian analysis has begun to be more widely adopted in X-ray spectroscopy, but it has largely been constrained to relatively simple physical models due to limitations in X-ray modelling software and computation time. As a result, Bayesian analysis of numerical models with high physics complexity have remained out of reach. This is a challenge, for example when modelling the X-ray emission of accreting black hole X-ray binaries, where the slow model computations severely limit explorations of parameter space and may bias the inference of astrophysical parameters. Here, we present RTFAST-Spectra: a neural network emulator that acts as a drop in replacement for the spectral portion of the black hole X-ray reverberation model RTDIST. This is the first emulator for the reltrans model suite and the first emulator for a state-of-the-art x-ray reflection model incorporating relativistic effects with 17 physically meaningful model parameters. We use Principal Component Analysis to create a light-weight neural network that is able to preserve correlations between complex atomic lines and simple continuum, enabling consistent modelling of key parameters of scientific interest. We achieve a $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ times speed up over the original model in the most conservative conditions with $\mathcal{O}(1\%)$ precision over all 17 free parameters in the original numerical model, taking full posterior fits from months to hours. We employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to show how we can better explore the posteriors of model parameters in simulated data and discuss the complexities in interpreting the model when fitting real data.

 Context. The study of open cluster morphology is pivotal for exploring their formation and evolutionary processes. Aims. We manage to assess the morphological stability of 105 nearby open clusters within tidal radii on the X-Y, X-Z, and Y-Z planes of the heliocentric Cartesian coordinate system, utilizing member catalogs from the literature. Meanwhile, we also delve into factors potentially impacting the clusters' morphological stability on these projection planes. Methods. We used the rose diagram method by constructing the 3D projected morphology of sample clusters to quantify the morphological stability of their 3D projected morphology. Results. Our analysis indicates there is a demonstrated linear positive correlation between the number of sample clusters' member stars within tidal radii and their morphological stability in different 3D projection planes. This may suggest that the more member stars there are within the tidal radius of a cluster, the stronger its own gravitational binding capacity is, resulting in strong morphological stability. We find a direct link between the clusters' morphological stabilities in the X-Z plane within tidal radii and their velocity dispersion in the same plane, suggesting that the morphological stabilities in the X-Z plane may be dependent on internal dynamics. Moreover, the morphological stability of the clusters' 3D projection is influenced by their spatial positions along the Y axis, but not linearly, indicating that the environmental changes at the clusters' location may affect their morphological stability. Likewise, specific external forces can have an effect on their morphological stability. Conclusions. This research introduces a novel perspective for understanding the morphological stability of open clusters, with a particular focus on their 3D projected morphologies.

          Recovering Pulsar Braking Index from a Population of Millisecond Pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 The braking index, $n$, of a pulsar is a measure of its angular momentum loss and the value it takes corresponds to different spin-down mechanisms. For a pulsar spinning down due to gravitational wave emission from the principal mass quadrupole mode alone, the braking index would equal exactly 5. Unfortunately, for millisecond pulsars, it can be hard to measure observationally due to the extremely small second time derivative of the rotation frequency, $\ddot{f}$. This paper aims to examine whether it could be possible to extract the distribution of $n$ for a whole population of pulsars rather than measuring the values individually. We use simulated data with an injected $n=5$ signal for 47 millisecond pulsars and extract the distribution using hierarchical Bayesian inference methods. We find that while possible, observation times of over 20 years and RMS noise of the order of $10^{-5}$ ms are needed, which can be compared to the mean noise value of $3\times10^{-4}$ ms for the recent wideband 12.5-year NANOGrav sample, which provided the pulsar timing data used in this paper.

 - **Abstract**
 Next generations of radio surveys are expected to identify tens of millions of new sources, and identifying and classifying their morphologies will require novel and more efficient methods. Self-Organising Maps (SOMs), a type of unsupervised machine learning, can be used to address this problem. We map 251,259 multi-Gaussian sources from Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) onto a SOM with discrete neurons. Similarity metrics, such as Euclidean distances, can be used to identify the best-matching neuron or unit (BMU) for each input image. We establish a reliability threshold by visually inspecting a subset of input images and their corresponding BMU. We label the individual neurons based on observed morphologies and these labels are included in our value-added catalogue of RACS sources. Sources for which the Euclidean distance to their BMU is $\lesssim$ 5 (accounting for approximately 79$\%$ of sources) have an estimated $>90\%$ reliability for their SOM-derived morphological labels. This reliability falls to less than 70$\%$ at Euclidean distances $\gtrsim$ 7. Beyond this threshold it is unlikely that the morphological label will accurately describe a given source. Our catalogue of complex radio sources from RACS with their SOM-derived morphological labels from this work will be made publicly available.

          From CO$_2$- to H$_2$O-dominated atmospheres and back -- How mixed outgassing changes the volatile distribution in magma oceans around M dwarf stars

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of CO$_2$ on TRAPPIST-1 e, f and g during the magma ocean stage. These potentially habitable rocky planets are currently the most accessible for astronomical observations. A constraint on the volatile budget during the magma ocean stage is a link to planet formation and also needed to judge their habitability. We perform simulations with 1-100 terrestrial oceans (TO) of H$_2$O with and without CO$_2$ and for albedos 0 and 0.75. The CO$_2$ mass is scaled with initial H$_2$O by a constant factor between 0.1 and 1. The magma ocean state of rocky planets begins with a CO$_2$-dominated atmosphere but can evolve into a H$_2$O dominated state, depending on initial conditions. For less than 10 TO initial H$_2$O, the atmosphere tends to desiccate and the evolution may end with a CO$_2$ dominated atmosphere. Otherwise, the final state is a thick (>1000 bar) H$_2$O-CO$_2$ atmosphere. Complete atmosphere desiccation with less than 10 TO initial H$_2$O can be significantly delayed for TRAPPIST-1e and f, when H$_2$O has to diffuse through a CO$_2$ atmosphere to reach the upper atmosphere, where XUV photolysis occurs. As a consequence of CO$_2$ diffusion-limited water loss, the time of mantle solidification for TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g can be significantly extended compared to a pure H$_2$O evolution by up to 40 Myrs for albedo 0.75 and by up to 200 Mrys for albedo 0. The addition of CO$_2$ further results in a higher water content in the melt during the magma ocean stage. Our compositional model adjusted for the measured metallicity of TRAPPIST-1 yields for the dry inner planets (b, c, d) an iron fraction of 27 wt-%. For TRAPPIST-1 e, this iron fraction would be compatible with a (partly) desiccated evolution scenario and a CO$_2$ atmosphere with surface pressures of a few 100 bar. A comparative study between TRAPPIST-1 e and the inner planets may yield the most insights about formation and evolution scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Traditional methods for determining the radius of a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ neutron star ($R_{1.4}$) rely on specific equations of state (EOS) models that describe various types of dense nuclear matter. This dependence on EOS models can introduce substantial systematic uncertainties, which may exceed the measurement uncertainties when constraining $R_{1.4}$. In this study, we explore a novel approach to constraining $R_{1.4}$ using data from NICER observations of PSR J0030+0451 (J0030) and PSR J0437-4715 (J0437). However, this work presents a more data-driven analysis framework, substantially decreasing the need for EOS assumptions. By analyzing the Mass-Radius measurements of these two neutron stars, we infer $R_{1.4}$ using statistical methods based mostly on observational data. We examine various hotspot configurations for J0030, along with new J0437 observations, and their effects on the inferred radius. Our results are consistent with X-ray timing, gravitational wave, and nuclear physics constraints, while avoiding EOS-related biases. The same method has also been applied to a simulated mass-radius dataset, based on our knowledge of future X-ray telescopes, demonstrating the model's ability to recover the injected $R_{1.4}$ value in certain cases. This method provides a data-driven pathway for extracting neutron star properties and offers a new approach for future observational efforts in neutron star astrophysics.

          Transient Blurring of the Scintillation Arc of Pulsar B1737+13

 - **Abstract**
 For many pulsars, the scattering structures responsible for scintillation are typically dominated by a single, thin screen along the line of sight, which persists for years or decades. In recent years, an increasing number of doubly-lensed events have been observed, where a secondary lens crosses the line of sight. This causes additional or distorted scintillation arcs over time scales ranging from days to months. In this work we report such a transient event for pulsar B1737+13 and propose a possible lensing geometry including the distance to both lenses, and the orientation of the main screen. Using phase retrieval techniques to separate the two lenses in the wavefield, we report a curvature and rate of motion of features associated with the secondary lens as it passed through the line of sight. By fitting the annual variation of the curvature, we report a possible distance and orientation for the main screen. The distance of the secondary lens is found by mapping the secondary feature onto the sky and tracking its position over time for different distances. We validate this method using B0834+06, for which the screen solutions are known through VLBI, and successfully recover the correct solution for the secondary feature. With the identified lensing geometry, we are able to estimate the size of the secondary lens, 1 - 3 au. Although this an appropriate size for a structure that could cause an extreme scattering event, we do not have conclusive evidence for or against that possibility.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the variability of the thermal (accretion disc) and non-thermal (jet) emission of thirteen flat spectrum radio quasars in the optical and near infrared (OIR) regime using light curves spanning years with an average sampling of three observations per week. We fit a combination of a blackbody and a power-law function to the OIR data, in the blazar rest frame, to extract the corresponding thermal (disc) and non-thermal (jet) components from the total flux. We carry out this analysis for the entire duration of the light curves to obtain the variation of the disc and jet components over years. Reliability of our fits have been affirmed by successfully retrieving accurate parameters by employing our method to simulated data and by comparing our results with published disc luminosity obtained by other methods for a few well-observed blazars. In blazars, the thermal (disc) emission is difficult to extract because the relativistically beamed radiation of the jet dominates at all wavelengths. By employing this method, the disc emission in blazars may be estimated directly from photometric data at OIR bands instead of indirect methods, such as, inferring it from the emission line luminosities. We find that the variability of the disc and jet emission obtained by the above method are strongly correlated in most cases.

          Old Dogs, New Tricks: Re-examining Photographic Spectra of Plaskett's Star

 - **Abstract**
 Photographic spectra of Plaskett's Star (PS; HR2420, HD47129, V640 Mon) that were recorded at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory (DAO) have been digitized with a flatbed scanner. Many of the spectra were recorded during campaigns in 1922 and 1937, and sample wavelengths between 0.39 and 0.50um. Spectra of poor quality are identified. Mean spectra near orbital phases 0.25 and 0.75 match many characteristics of synthetic spectra, although Hgamma and HeI 4388 are exceptions. Evidence is presented that Hgamma was affected by transient activity in 1937, but not in 1922. Emission lines of NIII and HeII move with wavelength in a manner that is consistent with them tracking the motion of the secondary, indicating that an 'f' spectral type designation should be assigned to the secondary. The location of the peak that is associated with the secondary in cross-correlation functions changes with time near phase 0.75, although the mean amplitude of the radial velocity curve of the secondary did not change between the two campaigns. There is also an offset in velocities of the primary measured from Hgamma and HeI 4472 near phase 0.25. The velocity curves of the components suggest a mass ratio that is larger than previous estimates, although uncertainties associated with the spectroscopic features attributed to the secondary, coupled with the wavelength resolution of the spectra, complicate efforts to determine robust masses. We conclude that peculiarities in the radial velocity curves of the components have thus been in place for over a thousand orbital cycles.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the star-forming cluster NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) had revealed a large population of pre-main sequence (PMS) candidates, characterised by Halpha excess emission in their photometry. However, without access to spectroscopy, the nature of these objects remained unclear. Using the NIRSpec instrument on board JWST, we studied a sample of these stars, with masses in the range ~0.9-1.8 Msun, effective temperatures in the range 4,500-8,000 K, and PMS ages between ~0.1 and 30 Myr. Here we present the first spectra of solar-mass PMS stars in the metal-poor SMC (Z=1/8 Zsun) and discuss the physical properties of ten representative sources with good signal-to-noise ratio. The observations indicate that even the oldest of these PMS candidates are still accreting gas with typical rates of ~10^{-8} Msun/yr for stars older than ~10 Myr, confirming their PMS nature. The spectra also reveal near-infrared excess and molecular hydrogen excitation lines consistent with the presence of discs around these stars. These findings suggest that in a low-metallicity environment circumstellar discs can live longer than previously thought.

 - **Abstract**
 We study realistic models predicting primordial black hole (PBH) formation from density fluctuations generated in a first-order phase transition. We show that the second-order correction in the expansion of the bubble nucleation rate is necessary for accurate predictions and quantify its impact on the abundance of PBHs and gravitational waves (GWs). We find that the distribution of the fluctuations becomes more Gaussian as the second-order term increases. Consequently, models that predict the same PBH abundances can produce different GW spectra.
