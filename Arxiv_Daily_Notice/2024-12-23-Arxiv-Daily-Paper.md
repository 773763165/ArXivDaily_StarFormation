#### Title:
          Comments on the Union3 "Spline-Interpolated Distance Moduli" Model

 - **Abstract**
 The Union3 "Spline-Interpolated Distance Moduli" model posterior has been distributed for third-party cosmology analysis. The posterior prefers a large value of $\Omega_M$, a small absolute value of $w_0$, and a negative $w_a$, but still accommodates $\Lambda$CDM; the supernova data alone are not strongly constraining. The posterior is built assuming an underlying model and prior, both of which must be made to conform with any new model and prior being analyzed. The posterior is calculated for a prior that is not flat but rather has non-trivial structure in $\Omega_M$-$w_0$-$w_a$; the associated likelihood is slightly shifted relative to the posterior. The posterior for a prior that is flat in $\Omega_M$-$w_0$-$w_a$ is also shifted relative to the original, but not at a level that is statistically significant. The misapplication of Union3 results in the "DESI2024 VI" cosmology fits are inconsequential.

          Evolution of Hubble parameter from Pantheon+ data and comparison of cosmological models using cosmic chronometers

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ with redshift $z$ is estimated from the Pantheon+ data of Type Ia supernovae, for the $\Lambda$CDM model and the three special cases of the eternal coasting (EC) cosmological model with three different spatial geometries. The scatter associated with $H(z)$ is seen to grow markedly with redshift. This behaviour, which is deduced directly from the SNe Hubble diagram, raises the question of whether the universe is undergoing a stochastic expansion, which scenario can offer an explanation for the Hubble tension in cosmology. From the estimated $H(z)$ values, the present value of the Hubble parameter $H_0$ is evaluated for each of these models through regression, and the scatter using the Monte Carlo method. Bayesian comparison between these models is carried out using the data of 35 cosmic chronometers (CC). The comparative study favours the $\Lambda$CDM model, with some strong evidence. However, exclusion of four outlier CC data points with small errorbars leads to large reduction in the Bayes factor value. The unusually large value of Bayes factor obtained while using the full set of CC data raises some concerns about its tension with other data, such as that of the SNe Ia. While using the remaining 31 CC data points, it is observed that the resulting Bayes factor still favours the $\Lambda$CDM model, but with a much smaller value of the Bayes factor. When EC models are compared among themselves, the $\Omega = 2$ model has strong evidence than the $\Omega = 1$ (also known as $R_h = ct$) and the $\Omega = 0$ (Milne-type) models.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) detected Ultra High Energy (UHE) photons in the range 100 TeV to 1.4 PeV from twelve sources including Crab nebula. The detection of these photons demands the presence of at least PeV energy particle in the source. It is important to understand particle acceleration and radiation emission processes in such source. One of those twelve sources, LHAASO J2108+5157 does not show any association or counterparts at any other wavelength. In search of counterpart, we surveyed the region with Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 650 MHz frequency. GMRT observation revel radio emission from an extended source within the PSF of LHAASO which shows disk-jet morphology. Considering the spatial association and extent of the source, it is plausible that particle acceleration to PeV energies originates from this source.

          Mapping Dark Matter Through the Dust of the Milky Way Part I: Dust Correction and Phase Space Density

 - **Abstract**
 The Boltzmann equation relates the equilibrium phase space distribution of stars in the Milky Way to the Galaxy's gravitational potential. However, observations of stellar populations are biased by extinction from foreground dust, which complicates measurements of the potential in the disk and towards the Galactic center. Using the kinematics of Red Clump and Red Branch stars in Gaia DR3, we use machine learning to simultaneously estimate both the unbiased stellar phase space density and the gravitational potential. The unbiased phase space density is obtained through a learned "dust efficiency factor" -- an observational selection function that accounts for dust extinction. The potential and the dust efficiency are parameterized by fully connected neural networks and are completely data driven. We validate the dust efficiency using a recent three-dimensional dust map in this work, and examine the potential in a companion paper.

          Inflation without an Inflaton

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel scenario in which scalar perturbations, that seed the large scale structure of the Universe, are generated without relying on a scalar field (the inflaton). In this framework, inflation is driven by a de Sitter space-time (dS), where tensor metric fluctuations (i.e., gravitational waves) naturally arise from quantum vacuum oscillations, and scalar fluctuations are generated via second-order tensor effects. We compute the power spectrum of such scalar fluctuations and show it to be consistent with near scale-invariance. We derive the necessary conditions under which scalar perturbations become significant and much larger than the tensor modes, and we identify a natural mechanism to end inflation via a transition to a radiation-dominated phase. Our proposed mechanism could remove the need for a model-dependent scenario: the choice of a scalar field, as the inflaton, to drive inflation.

          LOFAR non-detections of SN 2023ixf in its first year post-explosion

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 We used the LOFAR telescope to monitor SN 2023ixf, a core-collapse supernova in M101, between 8 and 368 days post-explosion. We report non-detections down to ~80 {\mu}Jy sensitivity at 144 MHz. Our non-detections are consistent with published radio observations at higher frequencies. At the time, we are not able to constrain the properties of low-frequency absorption due to the progenitor star's circumstellar medium via these LOFAR observations.

          Impact of DESI BAO Data on Inflationary Parameters: stability against late-time new physics
 - **Authors:** Simony Santos da Costa

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, I investigate the impact of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data on cosmological parameters, focusing on the inflationary spectral index $n_s$, the amplitude of scalar perturbations $A_s$, and the matter density parameter $\omega_m$. By examining different models of late-time new physics, the inflationary parameters were revealed to be stable when compared with the baseline dataset that used the earlier BAO data from the SDSS collaboration. When combined with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae (SNeIa), DESI BAO data leads to a slight reduction in $\omega_m$ (less than 2\%) and modest changes in $A_s$ and $n_s$, if compared with the same combination but using SDSS BAO data instead, suggesting a subtle shift in matter clustering. These effects may be attributed to a higher expansion rate from dynamical dark energy, changes in the recombination period, or modifications to the matter-radiation equality time. Further analyses of models with dynamical dark energy and free curvature show a consistent trend of reduced $\omega_m$, accompanied by slight increases in both $n_s$ and $H_0$. The results emphasize the importance of the DESI BAO data in refining cosmological parameter estimates and highlight the stability of inflationary parameters across different late-time cosmological models.

          Free streaming of warm wave dark matter in modified expansion histories

 - **Abstract**
 In models of warm dark matter, there is an appreciable population of high momentum particles in the early universe, which free stream out of primordial over/under densities, thereby prohibiting the growth of structure on small length scales. The distance that a dark matter particle travels without obstruction, known as the free streaming length, depends on the particle's mass and momentum, but also on the cosmological expansion rate. In this way, measurements of the linear matter power spectrum serve to probe warm dark matter as well as the cosmological expansion history. In this work, we focus on ultra-light wave wave dark matter (WWDM) characterized by a typical comoving momentum $q_\ast$ and mass $m$. We first derive constraints on the WWDM parameter space $(q_\ast, m)$ using Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations due to a combination of the free-streaming effect and the white-noise effect. We next assess how the free streaming of WWDM is affected by three modified expansion histories: early matter domination, early dark energy, and very early dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 Models predict that the well-studied mass-radius relation of white dwarf stars depends on the temperature of the star, with hotter white dwarfs having larger masses at a given radius than cooler stars. In this paper, we use a catalog of 26,041 DA white dwarfs observed in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Releases 1-19. We measure the radial velocity, effective temperature, surface gravity, and radius for each object. By binning this catalog in radius or surface gravity, we average out the random motion component of the radial velocities for nearby white dwarfs to isolate the gravitational redshifts for these objects and use them to directly measure the mass-radius relation. For gravitational redshifts measured from binning in either radius or surface gravity, we find strong evidence for a temperature-dependent mass-radius relation, with warmer white dwarfs consistently having greater gravitational redshifts than cool objects at a fixed radius or surface gravity. For warm white dwarfs, we find that their mean radius is larger and mean surface gravity is smaller than those of cool white dwarfs at 5.2{\sigma} and 6.0{\sigma} significance, respectively. Selecting white dwarfs with similar radii or surface gravities, the significance of the difference in mean gravitational redshifts between the warm and cool samples is >6.1{\sigma} and >3.6{\sigma} for measurements binned in radius and surface gravity, respectively, in the direction predicted by theory. This is an improvement over previous implicit detections, and our technique can be expanded to precisely test the white dwarf mass-radius relation with future surveys.

          A first taste of MEAD (Measuring Extinction and Abundances of Dust) -- I. Diffuse Milky Way interstellar dust extinction features in JWST infrared spectra

 - **Abstract**
 We present the initial results of MEAD (Measuring Extinction and Abundances of Dust), with a focus on the dust extinction features observed in our JWST near- and mid-infrared spectra of nine diffuse Milky Way sightlines ($1.2 \leq A(V) \leq 2.5$). For the first time, we find strong correlations between the 10 $\mu$m silicate feature strength and the column densities of Mg, Fe and O in dust. This is consistent with the well-established theory that Mg- and Fe-rich silicates are responsible for this feature. We obtained an average stoichiometry of the silicate grains in our sample of Mg:Fe:O = 1.1:1:11.2, constraining the grain composition. We find variations in the feature properties, indicating that different sightlines contain different types of silicates. In the average spectrum of our sample, we tentatively detect features around 3.4 and 6.2 $\mu$m, which are likely caused by aliphatic and aromatic/olefinic hydrocarbons, respectively. If real, to our knowledge, this is the first detection of hydrocarbons in purely diffuse sightlines with $A(V) \leq 2.5$, confirming the presence of these grains in diffuse environments. We detected a 3 $\mu$m feature toward HD073882, and tentatively in the sample average, likely caused by water ice (or solid-state water trapped on silicate grains). If confirmed, to our knowledge, this is the first detection of ice in purely diffuse sightlines with $A(V) \leq 2.5$, supporting previous findings that these molecules can exist in the diffuse ISM.

          Disk Evolution Study Through Imaging of Nearby Young Stars (DESTINYS): Dynamical Evidence of a Spiral-Arm-Driving and Gap-Opening Protoplanet from SAO 206462 Spiral Motion

 - **Abstract**
 In the early stages of planetary system formation, young exoplanets gravitationally interact with their surrounding environments and leave observable signatures on protoplanetary disks. Among these structures, a pair of nearly symmetric spiral arms can be driven by a giant protoplanet. For the double-spiraled SAO 206462 protoplanetary disk, we obtained three epochs of observations spanning 7 yr using the Very Large Telescope's SPHERE instrument in near-infrared $J$-band polarized light. By jointly measuring the motion of the two spirals at three epochs, we obtained a rotation rate of $-0.85^\circ\pm0.05^\circ~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. This rate corresponds to a protoplanet at $66\pm3$ au on a circular orbit dynamically driving both spirals. The derived location agrees with the gap in ALMA dust-continuum observations, indicating that the spiral driver may also carve the observed gap. What is more, a dust filament at $\sim$63 au observed by ALMA coincides with the predicted orbit of the spiral-arm-driving protoplanet. This double-spiraled system is an ideal target for protoplanet imaging.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high resolution WIYN/NEID echelle spectroscopy (R $\approx70$,000) of the supernova (SN) 2023ixf in M101, obtained 1.51 to 18.51 days after explosion over nine epochs. Daily monitoring for the first four days after explosion shows narrow emission features ($\leq200$ km s$^{-1}$), exhibiting predominantly blueshifted velocities, that rapidly weaken, broaden, and vanish in a manner consistent with radiative acceleration and the SN shock eventually overrunning or enveloping the full extent of dense circumstellar medium (CSM). The most rapid evolution is in the He I emission, which is visible on day 1.51 but disappears by day 2.62. We measure the maximum pre-SN speed of He I to be 25 $^{+0}_{-5} \pm2$ km s$^{-1}$, where the error is attributable to the uncertainty in how much the He I had already been radiatively accelerated, and to measurement of the emission line profile. The radiative acceleration of material is likely driven by the shock-CSM interaction, and the CSM is accelerated to $\geq200$ km s$^{-1}$ before being completely swept up by the SN shock to $\sim 2000$ km s$^{-1}$. We compare the observed spectra with spherically-symmetric r16wb HERACLES/CMFGEN model spectra and find the line evolution to generally be consistent with radiative acceleration and optical depth effects. The progenitor of SN2023ixf underwent an enhanced mass loss phase $\gtrsim 4$ year prior to core-collapse, creating a dense, asymmetric CSM region extending out to approximately $r_{CSM} = 3.7 \times 10^{14}$ ($v_\textrm{shock}$/9500 km s$^{-1}$) cm.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate primary beam calibration is essential for precise brightness measurements in radio astronomy. The VLA Low-band Ionosphere and Transient Experiment (VLITE) faces challenges in calibration due to the offset Cassegrain optics used in its commensal observing system. This study aims to develop a novel calibration method to improve accuracy with no impact on the Very Large Array (VLA) primary science observations. We used the apparent brightness of standard candles identified in VLITE's commensal data to develop 1D and 2D primary beam response models. These models accounted for operational changes and asymmetries caused by the subreflector and were validated against holographic methods and compact source light curves. The models achieved calibration accuracy within 3 percent across the field of view, significantly improving the precision of brightness measurements. The results were consistent with holography-derived solutions and performed reliably under different operational conditions. This improved calibration technique expands VLITE's capabilities for studying active galactic nuclei, transients, and pulsars. It offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional holographic methods, facilitating broader use in commensal observing systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection and constraint of the orbits of long-period giant planets is essential for enabling their further study through direct imaging. Recently, Venner et al. (2024) highlighted discrepancies between the solutions presented by Feng et al. (2022) and those from other studies, which primarily use orvara. We address these concerns by reanalyzing the data for HD 28185, GJ 229, HD 211847, GJ 680, HD 111031, and eps Ind A, offering explanations for these discrepancies. Based on a comparison between the methods used by Feng et al. (2022) and orvara, we find the discrepancies are primarily data-related rather than methodology-related. Our re-analysis of HD 28185 highlights many of the data-related issues and particularly the importance of parallax modeling for year-long companions. The case of eps Ind A b is instructive to emphasize the value of an extended RV baseline for accurately determining orbits of long period companions. Our orbital solutions highlight other causes for discrepancies between solutions including the combination of absolute and relative astrometry, clear definitions of conventions, and efficient posterior sampling for the detection of wide-orbit giant planets.

 The Tibet AS$\gamma$ experiment successfully detected sub-PeV $\gamma$-rays from the Crab nebula using a Surface Array and underground muon detector. Considering this, we are building in Bolivia a new experiment to explore the Southern Hemisphere, looking for the origins of cosmic rays in our Galaxy. The name of this project is Andes Large area PArticle detector for Cosmic ray physics and Astronomy (ALPACA). A prototype array called ALPAQUITA, with $1/4$ the total area of the full ALPACA, started observations in September $2022$. In this paper we introduce the status of ALPAQUITA and the plans to extend the array. We also report the results of the observation of the moon shadow in cosmic rays.

 - **Abstract**
 The observation of the kilonova AT2017gfo and investigations of its light curves and spectra confirmed that neutron star mergers are sites of r-process nucleosynthesis. However, the identification of elements responsible for the spectral features is still challenging, particularly at the near-infrared wavelengths. In this study, we systematically searched for all possible near-infrared transitions of heavy elements using experimentally calibrated energy levels. Our analysis reveals that most candidate elements with strong absorption lines are lanthanides (Z=57-71) and actinides (Z=89-103). This is due to their complex structures leading to many low-lying energy levels, which results in strong transitions in the near-infrared range. Domoto et al. (2022) have shown that La III and Ce III can explain the absorption features at $\lambda\sim$ 12,000 - 15,000 A. While our results confirm that these two elements show strong infrared features, we additionally identify Gd III as the next most promising species. Due to its unique atomic structure involving the half-filled 4f and the outer 5d orbitals, Gd III has one of the lowest-lying energy levels, between which relatively strong transitions occur. We also find absorption lines caused by Gd III in the near-infrared spectrum of a chemically peculiar star HR 465, which supports their emergence in kilonova spectra. By performing radiative transfer simulations, we confirm that Gd III lines affect the feature at $\sim$ 12,000 A previously attributed to La III. Future space-based time-series observations of kilonova spectra will allow the identification of Gd III lines.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmological principle asserting the large-scale uniformity of the Universe is a testable assumption of the standard cosmological model. We explore the constraints on anisotropic expansion provided by measuring directional variation in the Hubble constant, $H_0$, derived from differential zeropoint measurements of the Tully-Fisher distance estimator. We fit various models for directional variation in $H_0$ using the Tully-Fisher dataset from the all-sky Cosmicflows-4 catalog. The best-fit dipole variation has an amplitude of 0.063 $\pm$ 0.016 mag in the direction ($\ell,b$) = (142 $\pm$ 30$^{\circ}$, 52 $\pm$ 10$^{\circ}$). If this were due to anisotropic expansion it would imply a 3% variation in $H_0$, corresponding to $\Delta H_0$ = 2.10 $\pm$ 0.53 km/s/Mpc if $H_0$ = 70 km/s/Mpc, with a significance of 3.9$\sigma$. A model that includes this $H_0$ dipole is only weakly favored relative to a model with a constant $H_0$ and a bulk motion of the volume sampled by Cosmicflows-4 that is consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. However, we show that with the expected Tully-Fisher data from the WALLABY and DESI surveys it should be possible to detect a 1% $H_0$ dipole anisotropy at 5.8$\sigma$ confidence and to distinguish it from the typical bulk flow predicted by $\Lambda$CDM over the volume of these surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop an analytic method of inverting the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) relations to high accuracy. This method is developed from the strong correlations that are shown to exist between the neutron star mass-radius curve and the equation of state (EOS) or pressure-energy density relation. Selecting points that have masses equal to fixed fractions of the maximum mass, we find a semi-universal power-law relation between the central energy densities, pressures, sound speeds, chemical potentials and number densities of those stars, with the maximum mass and the radii of one or more fractional maximum mass points. Root-mean-square fitting accuracies, for EOSs without large first-order phase transitions, are typically 0.5\% for all quantities at all mass points. The method also works well, although less accurately, in reconstructing the EOS of hybrid stars with first-order phase transitions. These results permit, in effect, an analytic method of inverting an arbitrary mass-radius curve to yield its underlying EOS. We discuss applications of this inversion technique to the inference of the dense matter EOS from measurements of neutron star masses and radii as a possible alternative to traditional Bayesian approaches.

 - **Abstract**
 Weak lensing surveys, along with most other late-Universe probes, have consistently measured a lower amplitude of the matter fluctuation spectrum, denoted by the parameter $S_8$, compared to predictions from early-Universe measurements in cosmic microwave background data. Improper modelling of nonlinear scales may partially explain these discrepancies in lensing surveys. This study investigates whether the conventional approach to addressing small-scale biases remains optimal for Stage-IV lensing surveys. We demonstrate that conventional weak lensing estimators are affected by scale leakage from theoretical biases at nonlinear scales, which influence all observed scales. Using the BNT transform, we propose an $\ell$-cut methodology that effectively controls this leakage. The BNT transform reorganizes weak lensing data in $\ell$ space, aligning it with $k$ space, thereby reducing the mixing of nonlinear scales and providing a more accurate interpretation of the data. We evaluate the BNT approach by comparing HMcode, Halofit, Baryon Correction Model and AxionHMcode mass power spectrum models using Euclid-like survey configurations. Additionally, we introduce a new estimator to quantify scale leakage in both the BNT and noBNT approaches. Our findings show that BNT outperforms traditional methods, preserving cosmological constraints while significantly mitigating theoretical biases.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the structure of the Galactic disk is crucial for understanding the formation and evolutionary history of the Milky Way. This study examines the structure of the Galactic disk by analyzing a sample of 138,667 primary red clump (RC) stars from the LAMOST and Gaia datasets. We have categorized these RC stars into mono-age populations and investigated their spatial distributions within the R - Z plane, estimating scale heights and lengths through the fitting of their vertical and radial density profiles. Our analysis indicates that the vertical profiles of these mono-age populations fit a dual-component disk model, where both components exhibit significant flaring, particularly in the outer disk regions. Within a constant Galactocentric radius R, the scale heights of the first component, representing the morphologically thin disk, rise with age. In contrast, the scale heights of the second component, corresponding to the morphologically thick disk, remain comparatively stable across different age groups. Additionally, the radial density profiles of both disk components predominantly peak within a radial range of 7.5-8.5 kpc. These findings underscore the importance of age as a crucial factor in shaping the spatial distribution and structural evolution of the Galactic disk, offering valuable insights into its complex dynamics and history.

 - **Abstract**
 Conventional calibration of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data relies on estimation of the sound horizon at drag epoch $r_d$ from early universe observations by assuming a cosmological model. We present a recalibration of two independent BAO datasets, SDSS and DESI, by employing deep learning techniques for model-independent estimation of $r_d$, and explore the impacts on $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters. Significant reductions in both Hubble ($H_0$) and clustering ($S_8$) tensions are observed for both the recalibrated datasets. Moderate shifts in some other parameters hint towards further exploration of such data-driven approaches.

 - **Abstract**
 We search for an excess of electrons and positrons in the interplanetary space from the decays of heavy neutrinos produced in nuclear reactions in the Sun. Using measurements of the electron spectra in the MeV range from the Ulysses and SOHO satellites, we report the strongest direct upper bound to date on the mixing between heavy neutral leptons with MeV masses and electron neutrinos, reaching $U_e^2\simeq 10^{-6}$ at $M_N=10$ MeV. Our sensitivity is predominantly constrained by the uncertainties in the propagation of electrons and positrons, particularly the diffusion coefficient in the inner Solar System, as well as the uncertainties in the astrophysical background. Enhancing our understanding of either of these factors could lead to a significant improvement in sensitivity.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio frequency interference (RFI) is a persistent contaminant in terrestrial radio astronomy. While new radio interferometers are becoming operational, novel sources of RFI are also emerging. In order to strengthen the mitigation of RFI in modern radio interferometers, we propose an on-line RFI mitigation scheme that can be run in the correlator of such interferometers. We combine statistics based on the energy as well as the polarization alignment of the correlated signal to develop an on-line RFI mitigation scheme that can be applied to a data stream produced by the correlator in real-time, especially targeted at low duty-cycle or transient RFI detection. In order to improve the computational efficiency, we explore the use of both single precision and half precision floating point operations in implementing the RFI mitigation algorithm. This ideally suits its deployment in accelerator computing devices such as graphics processing units (GPUs) as used by the LOFAR correlator. We provide results based on real data to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

 - **Abstract**
 Observational and/or astrophysical systematics modulating the observed number of luminous tracers can constitute a major limitation in the cosmological exploitation of surveys of the large scale structure of the universe. Part of this limitation arises on top of our ignorance on how such systematics actually impact the observed galaxy/quasar fields. In this work we develop a generic, hybrid model for an arbitrary number of systematics that may modulate observations in both an additive and a multiplicative way. This model allows us devising a novel algorithm that addresses the identification and correction for either additive and/or multiplicative contaminants. We test this model on galaxy mocks and systematics templates inspired from data of the third data release of the {\it Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey} (J-PLUS). We find that our method clearly outperforms standard methods that assume either an additive or multiplicative character for all contaminants in scenarios where both characters are actually acting on the observed data. In simpler scenarios where only an additive or multiplicative imprint on observations is considered, our hybrid method does not lie far behind the corresponding simplified, additive/multiplicative methods. Nonetheless, in scenarios of mild/low impact of systematics, we find that our hybrid approach converges towards the standard method that assumes additive contamination, as predicted by our model describing systematics. Our methodology also allows for the estimation of biases induced by systematics residuals on different angular scales and under different observational configurations, although these predictions necessarily restrict to the subset of {\em known/identified} potential systematics, and say nothing about ``unknown unknowns" possibly impacting the data.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensors have been demonstrated to have significant potential in X-ray astronomy, where long-term reliability is crucial for space X-ray telescopes. This study examines the long-term stability of a scientific CMOS sensor, focusing on its bias, dark current, readout noise, and X-ray spectral performance. The sensor was initially tested at -30 $^\circ$C for 16 months, followed by accelerated aging at 20 $^\circ$C. After a total aging period of 610 days, the bias map, dark current, readout noise, gain, and energy resolution exhibited no observable degradation. There are less than 50 pixels within the 4 k $\times$ 4 k array which show a decrease of the bias under 50 ms integration time by over 10 digital numbers (DNs). First-order kinetic fitting of the gain evolution predicts a gain degeneration of 0.73% over 3 years and 2.41% over 10 years. These results underscore the long-term reliability of CMOS sensors for application in space missions.

          Formation of supermassive stars and dense star clusters in metal-poor clouds exposed to strong FUV radiation

 - **Abstract**
 The direct collapse scenario, which predicts the formation of supermassive stars (SMSs) as precursors to supermassive black holes (SMBHs), has been explored primarily under the assumption of metal-free conditions. However, environments exposed to strong far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation, which is another requirement for the direct collapse, are often chemically enriched to varying degrees. In this study, we perform radiation hydrodynamic simulations of star-cluster formation in clouds with finite metallicities, $Z=10^{-6}$ to $10^{-2} Z_{\odot}$, incorporating detailed thermal and chemical processes and radiative feedback from forming stars. Extending the simulations to approximately two million years, we demonstrate that SMSs with masses exceeding $10^4~M_\odot$ can form even in metal-enriched clouds with $Z \lesssim 10^{-3} Z_{\odot}$. The accretion process in these cases, driven by "super-competitive accretion," preferentially channels gas into central massive stars in spite of small (sub-pc) scale fragmentation. At $Z \simeq 10^{-2} Z_{\odot}$, however, enhanced cooling leads to intense fragmentation on larger scales, resulting in the formation of dense star clusters dominated by very massive stars with $10^3 M_{\odot}$ rather than SMSs. These clusters resemble young massive or globular clusters observed in the distant and local universe, exhibiting compact morphologies and high stellar surface densities. Our findings suggest that SMS formation is viable below a metallicity threshold of approximately $10^{-3} Z_{\odot}$, significantly increasing the number density of massive seed black holes to levels sufficient to account for the ubiquitous SMBHs observed in the local universe. Moreover, above this metallicity, this scenario naturally explains the transition from SMS formation to dense stellar cluster formation.

          Shedding light on the origin of the broken misaligned circumtriple disk around GW Ori

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the origin of the observed misaligned rings in the circumtriple disk around GW Ori. Previous studies appeared to disagree on whether disk breaking is caused by the differential precession driven in the disk by the triple star system. In this letter, we show that the previous studies are in agreement with each other when using the same set of parameters. But for observationally motivated parameters of a typical protoplanetary disk, the disk is unlikely to break due to interactions with the triple star system. We run 3-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a circumtriple disk around GW Ori with different disk aspect ratios. For a disk aspect ratio typical of protoplanetary disks, $H/r \gtrsim 0.05$, the disk does not break. An alternative scenario for the gap's origin consistent with the expected disk aspect ratio involves the presence of giant circumtriple planets orbiting GW Ori.

          Linear response of rotating and flattened stellar clusters: the oblate Kuzmin-Kutuzov St\"ackel family

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the linear response of a series of spheroidal stellar clusters, the Kuzmin-Kutuzov Stäckel family, which exhibit a continuous range of flattening and rotation, extending from an isochrone sphere to a Toomre disk. The method successfully replicates the growing modes previously identified in published $N$-body simulations. It relies on the efficiency of the matrix method to quantify systematically the effects of rotation and flattening on the eigenmodes of the galaxy. We identify two types of bi-symmetric instabilities for the flatter models - the so-called bending and bar-growing modes - the latter of which persists even for very round models. As anticipated, in its least unstable configurations, the system becomes flatter as its rotational speed increases. More realistic equilibria will be required to achieve a better match to the main sequence of fast-slow rotators. The corresponding code is made public.

          Constraining the potential of the Milky Way using stellar streams and the Inverse Time Integration method

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a method for constraining the potential of the Milky Way using stellar streams with a known progenitor. The method expresses the stream in angle-action coordinates and integrates the orbits of the stars backwards in time to obtain the stripping point positions of the stream stars relative to the cluster. In the potential that generated the stream, the stars return approximately to the cluster centre. In a different potential, they are redirected to different locations. The free parameters of the model are estimated by maximising the degree of clustering of the stripping point distribution. We test this method with the stellar stream of the globular cluster M68 (NGC 4590). We use an N-body code to simulate the stream and generate a realistic star sample using a model of the Gaia selection function. We also simulate the expected observational uncertainties, and estimate the heliocentric distances and radial velocities of the stream stars from the cluster orbit. Using this sample of stars, we recover the values of four free parameters characterising the potential of the disc and the dark halo to an accuracy of about 10 per cent of the correct values. We show that this accuracy is improved up to about 2 per cent using the expected end-of-mission Gaia data. In addition, we obtain a strong correlation between the mass of the disc and the dark halo axis ratio, which is explained by the fact that the stream flows close and parallel to the disc plane.

 - **Abstract**
 The field of air shower physics, dedicated to understanding the development of cosmic-ray interactions with the Earth's atmosphere, faces a significant challenge regarding the muon content of air showers observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory, and numerous other observatories. Thorough comparisons between extensive air shower (EAS) measurements and simulations are imperative for determining the primary energy and mass of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Current simulations employing state-of-the-art hadronic interaction models reveal a muon deficit compared to experimental measurements, commonly known as the "Muon Puzzle". The primary cause of this deficit lies in the uncertainties surrounding high-energy hadronic interactions. In this contribution, we discuss the integration of a new hadronic interaction model, Pythia 8, into the effort to resolve the Muon Puzzle. While the Pythia 8 model is well-tailored in the context of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments, its application in air shower studies remained limited until now. However, recent advancements, particularly in the Angantyr model of Pythia 8, offer promising enhancements in describing hadron-nucleus interactions, thereby motivating its potential application in air shower simulations. We present results from EAS simulations conducted using CORSIKA 8, wherein Pythia is employed to model hadronic interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 The glitch signatures in $r_{010}$ for F-type stars (higher amplitude and period of the oscillatory component) are very different from those of G-type stars. The aim of this work is to analyse the signatures of these glitches and understand the origin of the differences in these signatures between G-type and F-type stars. We fit the glitch signatures in the frequencies, second differences, and $r_{010}$ ratios while assuming either a sinusoidal variation or a more complex expression. The fit provides the acoustic depth, and hence the position, of the bottom of the convective envelope for nine \textit{Kepler} stars and the Sun. We find that for F-type stars, the most commonly used fitting expressions for the glitch of the bottom of the convective envelope provide different measurements of the position of the bottom of the convective envelope for the three seismic indicators, while it is not the case for G-type stars. When adding an additional term in the fitting expression with twice the acoustic depth of the standard term (a contribution that accounts for the highly non-sinusoidal shape of the signature in the $r_{010}$ ratios), we find better agreement between the three seismic indicators and with the prediction of stellar evolution models. While the origin of this additional term is not yet understood, this may be an indication that the transition between the convective envelope and the underlying radiative zone is different for G- and F-type stars. This outcome brings new insight into the physics in these regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Model misspecification analysis strategies, such as anomaly detection, model validation, and model comparison are a key component of scientific model development. Over the last few years, there has been a rapid rise in the use of simulation-based inference (SBI) techniques for Bayesian parameter estimation, applied to increasingly complex forward models. To move towards fully simulation-based analysis pipelines, however, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive simulation-based framework for model misspecification analysis. In this work, we provide a solid and flexible foundation for a wide range of model discrepancy analysis tasks, using distortion-driven model misspecification tests. From a theoretical perspective, we introduce the statistical framework built around performing many hypothesis tests for distortions of the simulation model. We also make explicit analytic connections to classical techniques: anomaly detection, model validation, and goodness-of-fit residual analysis. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient self-calibrating training algorithm that is useful for practitioners. We demonstrate the performance of the framework in multiple scenarios, making the connection to classical results where they are valid. Finally, we show how to conduct such a distortion-driven model misspecification test for real gravitational wave data, specifically on the event GW150914.

          Composite Dark Energy and the Cosmological Tensions

 - **Abstract**
 The standard cosmological model currently in force, aka $\Lambda$CDM, has been plagued with a variety of tensions in the last decade or so, which puts it against the wall. At the core of the $\Lambda$CDM we have a rigid cosmological term, $\Lambda$, for the entire cosmic history. Recently, the results from the DESI collaboration suggested the possibility that dark energy (DE) should be dynamical rather than just a cosmological constant. Using a generic $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, DESI favors quintessence behavior at $\sim 3\sigma$ c.l. However, to alleviate the tensions the DE needs more features. In the proposed $w$XCDM model of [43] the DE is actually a composite cosmic fluid with two components $(X,Y)$ acting sequentially: first $X$ (above a transition redshift $z_t$) and second $Y$ (below $z_t$). Fitting the model to the data, we find that the late component $Y$ behaves as quintessence, like DESI. However, to cure the $H_0$ and growth tensions, $X$ must behave as `phantom matter' (PM), which in contrast to phantom DE provides positive pressure at the expense of negative energy density. Using the SNIa (considering separately Pantheon$+$ and DESY5), cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO, LSS data, and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that both tensions can be completely cut down. We also compare the $w$XCDM with our own results using the standard $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM parameterizations of the DE. In all cases, model $w$XCDM performs much better. Finally, we have repeated our analysis with BAO 3D data (replacing BAO 2D), and we still find that the dynamical DE models (including composite ones) provide a much better fit quality compared to $\Lambda$CDM. The growth tension is alleviated again, but in contrast, the $H_0$-tension remains significant, which is most likely reminiscent of the internal conflict in the BAO sector.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new, cosmologically model-independent, statistical analysis of the Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae spectroscopic dataset, improving a standard methodology adopted by Lane et al. We use the Tripp equation for supernova standardisation alone, thereby avoiding any potential correlation in the stretch and colour distributions. We compare the standard homogeneous cosmological model, i.e., $\Lambda$CDM, and the timescape cosmology which invokes backreaction of inhomogeneities. Timescape, while statistically homogeneous and isotropic, departs from average Friedmann-Lema\^ıtre-Robertson-Walker evolution, and replaces dark energy by kinetic gravitational energy and its gradients, in explaining independent cosmological observations. When considering the entire Pantheon+ sample, we find very strong evidence ($\ln B> 5$) in favour of timescape over $\Lambda$CDM. Furthermore, even restricting the sample to redshifts beyond any conventional scale of statistical homogeneity, $z > 0.075$, timescape is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM with $\ln B> 1$. These results provide evidence for a need to revisit the foundations of theoretical and observational cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial gravitational waves propagate almost unimpeded from the moment they are generated to the present epoch. Nevertheless, they are subject to convolution with a non-trivial transfer function. Within the standard thermal history, shifts in the temperature-redshift relation combine with damping effects by free streaming neutrinos to non-trivially process different wavelengths during radiation domination, with subsequently negligible effects at later times. Presuming a nearly scale invariant primordial spectrum, one obtains a characteristic late time spectrum, deviations from which would indicate departures from the standard thermal history. Given the paucity of probes of the early universe physics before nucleosynthesis, it is useful to classify how deviations from the standard thermal history of the early universe can be constrained from observations of the late time stochastic background. The late time spectral density has a plateau at high frequencies that can in principle be significantly enhanced or suppressed relative to the standard thermal history depending on the equation of state of the epoch intervening reheating and the terminal phase of radiation domination, imprinting additional features from bursts of entropy production, and additional damping at intermediate scales via anisotropic stress production. In this paper, we survey phenomenologically motivated scenarios of early matter domination, kination, and late time decaying particles as representative non-standard thermal histories, elaborate on their late time stochastic background, and discuss constraints on different model scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 We present improvements to the pointing accuracy of the South Pole Telescope (SPT) using machine learning. The ability of the SPT to point accurately at the sky is limited by its structural imperfections, which are impacted by the extreme weather at the South Pole. Pointing accuracy is particularly important during SPT participation in observing campaigns with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), which requires stricter accuracy than typical observations with the SPT. We compile a training dataset of historical observations of astronomical sources made with the SPT-3G and EHT receivers on the SPT. We train two XGBoost models to learn a mapping from current weather conditions to two telescope drive control arguments -- one which corrects for errors in azimuth and the other for errors in elevation. Our trained models achieve root mean squared errors on withheld test data of $2.14''$ in cross-elevation and $3.57''$ in elevation, well below our goal of $5''$ along each axis. We deploy our models on the telescope control system and perform further in situ test observations during the EHT observing campaign in 2024 April. Our models result in significantly improved pointing accuracy: for sources within the range of input variables where the models are best trained, average combined pointing error improved 33%, from $15.9''$ to $10.6''$. These improvements, while significant, fall shy of our ultimate goal, but they serve as a proof of concept for the development of future models. Planned upgrades to the EHT receiver on the SPT will necessitate even stricter pointing accuracy which will be achievable with our methods.
