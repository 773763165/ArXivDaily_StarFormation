 - **Abstract**
 The habitability of a planet is influenced by both its parent star and the properties of its local stellar neighborhood. Potential threats to habitability from the local stellar environment mainly arise from two factors: cataclysmic events such as powerful stellar explosions and orbital perturbations induced by close stellar encounters. Among the 4,500+ exoplanet-hosting stars, about 140+ are known to host planets in their habitable zones. In this study, we use \textit{Gaia DR3} data to investigate the 10~pc stellar neighborhood of the 84 habitable zone systems (HZS) closest to the Sun. We assess the possible risks that local stellar environment of these HZS pose to their habitability. In particular, we find that HD~165155 has a high stellar density around it, making it likely to experience at least one flyby encounter within a span of 5~Gyr. We also identified two high-mass stars ($M \geq 8 M_\odot$) as potential progenitors of supernovae, which could threaten the long-term survivability of habitable zone systems HD~48265 and TOI-1227. Further, to quantify the similarity between habitable zone stars and the Sun, as well as their respective 10~pc stellar environments, we employ various astrophysical parameters to define a Solar Similarity Index (SSI) and a Neighborhood Similarity Index (NSI). Our analysis suggests that HD~40307 exhibits the closest resemblance to the solar system, while HD~165155 shows the least resemblance.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent tension in the value of the cosmological parameter $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_M/0.3)^{1/2}$, which represents the amplitude of the matter density fluctuations of the universe, has not been resolved. In this work, we present constraints on $S_8$ with the X-ray angular power spectra of clusters and groups measured with the half-sky map from the eROSITA All Sky Survey data release 1 (eRASS1). Thanks to the extensive sky coverage of eRASS1, its power spectrum achieves unprecedented precision compared to previous measurements. Using a well-calibrated, physical halo gas model that includes astrophysics of feedback and non-thermal pressure support, we obtain $S_8 = 0.80^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$ with 1$\sigma$ uncertainty that is competitive against other cosmological probes. Our derived $S_8$ value is smaller than the primary CMB measurements from Planck, but still consistent to within $1\sigma$. We also obtain constraints on the astrophysics of feedback, non-thermal pressure, equation of state in cluster cores, and gas boundaries in clusters and groups. We discuss how additional X-ray observations, and cosmological surveys in microwave and optical, will further improve the cosmological constraints with the angular power spectrum. Our work demonstrates that the angular power spectrum of clusters and groups is a promising probe of both cosmology and astrophysics.

          Retrievals on NIRCam transmission and emission spectra of HD 189733b with PLATON 6, a GPU code for the JWST era

 - **Abstract**
 We present the 2.4--5.0 \um JWST/NIRCam emission spectrum of HD 189733b, along with an independent re-reduction of the previously published transmission spectrum at the same wavelengths. We use an upgraded version of PLanetary Atmospheric Tool for Observer Noobs (PLATON) to retrieve atmospheric parameters from both geometries. In transit, we obtain [M/H]=$0.53_{-0.12}^{+0.13}$ and C/O=$0.41_{-0.12}^{+0.13}$, assuming a power-law haze and equilibrium chemistry with methane depletion. In eclipse, we obtain [M/H]=$0.68_{-0.11}^{+0.15}$ and C/O=$0.43_{-0.05}^{+0.06}$, assuming a clear atmosphere and equilibrium chemistry without methane depletion. These results are consistent with each other, and with a re-run of our previously published joint retrieval of HST and Spitzer transmission and emission spectra. Accounting for methane depletion decreases the C/O ratio by 0.14/0.04 (transmission/emission), but changing the limb cloud parameterization does not affect the C/O ratio by more than 0.06. We detect H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, and H$_2$S in both the NIRCam transmission and emission spectra, find that methane is depleted on the terminator, and confirm with VULCAN that photochemistry is a potential cause of this depletion. We also find tentative (1.8$\sigma$) evidence of a dayside thermal inversion at millibar pressures. Finally, we take this opportunity to introduce a new version of PLATON. PLATON 6 supports GPU computation, speeding up the code up to 10x. It also supports free retrievals using both volume mixing ratio and centered-log ratio priors; emission from planetary surfaces of different compositions; updated opacities at improved resolution; and Pareto smoothed importance sampling leave-one-out cross validation (PSIS-LOO).

          Stellar Expansion or Inflation?

 - **Abstract**
 While stellar expansion after core-hydrogen exhaustion related to thermal imbalance has been documented for decades, the physical phenomenon of stellar inflation that occurs close to the Eddington limit has only come to the fore in recent years. We aim to elucidate the differences between these physical mechanisms for stellar radius enlargement, especially as additional terms such as `bloated' and `puffed-up' stars have been introduced in the recent massive star literature. We employ single and binary star MESA structure and evolution models for both constant mass, as well as models allowing for the mass to change, due to winds or binary interaction. We find cases that were previously attributed to stellar inflation in fact to be due to stellar expansion. We also highlight that while the opposite effect of expansion is contraction, the removal of an inflated zone should not be referred to as contraction but {\it deflation} as the star is still in thermal balance.

          Understanding Density Fluctuations in Supersonic, Isothermal Turbulence

 - **Abstract**
 Supersonic turbulence occurs in many environments, particularly in astrophysics. In the crucial case of isothermal turbulence, the probability density function (PDF) of the logarithmic density, $s$, is well measured, but a theoretical understanding of the processes leading to this distribution remains elusive. We investigate these processes using Lagrangian tracer particles to track $s$ and $\frac{ds}{dt}$ in direct numerical simulations, and we show that their evolution can be modeled as a stochastic differential process with time-correlated noise. The temporal correlation functions of $s$ and $\frac{ds}{dt}$ decay exponentially, as predicted by the model, and the decay timescale is $\approx$ 1/6 the eddy turnover time. The behavior of the conditional averages of $\frac{ds}{dt}$ and $\frac{d^2s}{dt^2}$ is also well explained by the model, which shows that the density PDF arises from a balance between stochastic compressions/expansions, which tend to broaden the PDF, and the acceleration/deceleration of shocks by density gradients, which tends to narrow it.

 - **Abstract**
 Early dark energy (EDE) is one of the leading models proposed to resolve the perplexing Hubble tension. Despite extensive scrutiny and testing against various observables, conclusive constraints remain elusive as we await new data. In this paper, we study the impact of EDE on the 21cm signal, a powerful probe of cosmic dawn, and the epoch of reionization. First, we examine the signatures of the shift in cosmological parameters and the new EDE parameters on the evolution of the 21cm signal compared to $\Lambda$CDM. We then focus on the implications of these signatures for upcoming radio interferometer telescopes, such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), and their ability to differentiate between EDE and $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, we forecast HERA's sensitivity to the fractional energy density of EDE, $f_{\rm EDE}$, assuming a fiducial EDE model. We find significant modifications to the 21cm signal due to the presence of EDE. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that HERA, operating in its designed configuration, is poised to differentiate between the models and be sensitive to $f_{\rm EDE}$ within $2\sigma$ after $\mathcal{O}(100)$ days of observation and $5\sigma$ after 2 years.

          RR Lyrae stars trace the Milky Way warp

 - **Abstract**
 The outskirts of the Milky Way disc have been known to be warped since the late 1950s. Although various stellar populations have shown an underlying warped distribution, the relation between the age of the population and the warp they trace remains an open question. Our goal in this work is to detect the presence of the warp in the RR Lyrae (RRL) population of the Galactic disc. We use a compilation of public catalogues of RRL stars, precise photometric distances ($\sim 5\%$) and Gaia DR3 proper motions to kinematically select a sample of thin disc RRL in the Galactic anticentre, where the tangential velocity best approximates the azimuthal velocity to differentiate between disc and halo. For disc-like RRL we analyse their mean vertical height and mean vertical velocity. We show, for the first time, that RRL stars with thin disc-like kinematics trace the warp. In the anticentre direction, the RRL population reaches a minimum in mean vertical height of $\approx 0.4$ kpc, with a trend systematically lower than the one found with Classical Cepheids. The kinematical signal of the RRL warp starts at $R\approx 10$ kpc and, rather than resembling the Cepheid's, shows a similar trend to the Red Clump population from previous works, reaching a maximum value of $\approx 7$ km/s in vertical velocity. We also obtain an estimation of the pattern speed of the RRL warp with a prograde rotation of $\approx 13 \pm 2 $ km/s/kpc, compatible with results obtained from Cepheids. Finally, we obtain a vertical velocity dispersion $\approx 17 $km/s, inconsistent with the kinematics of a canonical old age ($> 10$ Gyr) disc population and, instead, favouring a population dominated by intermediate-age ($3-4$ Gyr). Our results indicate that the thin disc RRL stars are a dynamical intermediate-age tracer of the warp, opening a new window to study the dependency of the warp with stellar age.

          How black hole activity may influence exoplanetary evolution in our Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 An increasing number of exoplanets have been discovered in the Milky Way galaxy, which is also known to harbour a super-massive black hole (Sagittarius A*) at its centre. Here, we investigate how the central black hole (BH) activity may affect the evolution of exoplanets in our Galaxy. Accreting BHs emit high-energy radiation -- extreme ultraviolet and X-rays -- which can lead to XUV photoevaporation of the planetary atmospheres. We evaluate the atmospheric mass-loss using both theoretical estimates of the BH radiative output and observational constraints on the past activity history of Sgr A*. The resulting mass-loss is analysed as a function of the galactocentric distance. For the first time, we compute the exoplanet atmospheric evolution under BH irradiation by explicitly including the temporal evolution of the central luminosity output (i.e. the BH activity history). We obtain that Sgr A* could have a major impact on exoplanets located in the inner region of the Galaxy (e.g. Galactic bulge): a significant fraction of the atmospheric mass can be removed by BH irradiation; and in extreme cases, the initial atmosphere may be completely stripped away. Such mass-loss can have important consequences on the atmospheric chemistry and potential biological evolution. We discuss the physical implications for planetary habitability, and we also briefly consider the case of stellar-mass BHs. Overall, accreting black holes may play a significant role in the evolution of exoplanets in our Galaxy across cosmic time.

          Globular clusters as cosmic clocks: new cosmological hints from their integrated light

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the reliability and robustness in measuring the age, metallicity and mass of a sample of old Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) from their integrated light, setting the stage for using GCs as cosmic clocks at high redshift. We analyse 77 GCs from the WAGGS project, first by measuring Lick indices and spectroscopic breaks with PyLick, then performing full-spectral-fitting (FSF) with BAGPIPES. The analysis of Lick indices offers an estimate of the GCs' age and [Z/H], generally aligning with literature values, but highlights a subset of old GCs for which we estimate younger ages. This discrepancy is attributed to the presence of blue horizontal branches (HB), which are not accounted for in the stellar population models. With FSF we measure the GCs' ages, [Z/H], and masses, also testing the cosmological prior's impact on ages. Compared to isochrone fitting estimates, ages are best recovered when the cosmological prior is removed, with a 20% increase in GCs' ages compatible with literature values (within $\pm$1.5 Gyr). The derived [Z/H] and mass agree with the reference values, regardless of HB morphology or fit setting, with average discrepancies across the entire sample of $\Delta$[Z/H]=-0.02$\pm$0.24 dex and $\Delta log(M/M_{\odot})=0.04\pm 0.28$ dex. Ages are best recovered for metal-rich GCs ([Z/H]$\geq$-0.4) showing a red HB (HBR>0), with 70% of the results compatible with literature values. Using a Gaussian Mixture Model, we identify a tail of 24 old GCs with age=13.4$\pm$1.1 Gyr. Being a natural lower limit to the age of the Universe, we use this value to constrain $H_0$, obtaining $H_0 = 70.5^{+7.7}_{-6.3}$ km/s/Mpc (stat+syst) when a flat $\Lambda$CDM with $\Omega_m =0.30 \pm 0.02$ is assumed. Validating the study of GCs based on integrated light lays the foundation to extend this type of study to high-z, where lensed GCs have begun to appear, thanks to JWST. (abridged)

          Cosmological perturbations in a generalised axion-like dark energy model

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse the cosmological evolution of a generalised axion-like field that drives the late-time acceleration of the Universe. This model can exhibit tracking behaviour which alleviates the coincidence problem. The cosmological perturbations are carried within a multi-fluid approach where the scalar field is described by a non-adiabatic fluid, i.e., whose speed of sound at the rest frame is different from the adiabatic one. The cosmological perturbations are solved since the radiation-dominated epoch and imposing initial adiabatic conditions for matter, radiation and the dark energy component, for modes well outside the Hubble horizon in the past. We analyse the homogeneous curvature perturbation, gravitational potential and dark energy perturbations in this model, as well as the matter power spectrum and f{\sigma}8. We discuss which parameters of the model are more favoured observationally.

 - **Abstract**
 We present frb-voe, a publicly available software package that enables radio observatories to broadcast fast radio burst (FRB) alerts to subscribers through low-latency virtual observatory events (VOEvents). We describe a use-case of frb-voe by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) Collaboration, which has broadcast thousands of FRB alerts to subscribers worldwide. Using this service, observers have daily opportunities to conduct rapid multi-wavelength follow-up observations of new FRB sources. Alerts are distributed as machine-readable reports and as emails containing FRB metadata, and are available to the public within approximately 13 seconds of detection. A sortable database and a downloadable JSON file containing FRB metadata from all broadcast alerts can be found on the CHIME/FRB public webpage. The frb-voe service also provides users with the ability to retrieve FRB names from the Transient Name Server (TNS) through the frb-voe client user interface (CLI). The frb-voe service can act as a foundation on which any observatory that detects FRBs can build its own VOEvent broadcasting service to contribute to the coordinated multi-wavelength follow-up of astrophysical transients.

 - **Abstract**
 The emerging era of big data in radio astronomy demands more efficient and higher-quality processing of observational data. While deep learning methods have been applied to tasks such as automatic radio frequency interference (RFI) detection, these methods often face limitations, including dependence on training data and poor generalization, which are also common issues in other deep learning applications within astronomy. In this study, we investigate the use of the open-source image recognition and segmentation model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), and its optimized version, HQ-SAM, due to their impressive generalization capabilities. We evaluate these models across various tasks, including RFI detection and solar radio burst (SRB) identification. For RFI detection, HQ-SAM (SAM) shows performance that is comparable to or even superior to the SumThreshold method, especially with large-area broadband RFI data. In the search for SRBs, HQ-SAM demonstrates strong recognition abilities for Type II and Type III bursts. Overall, with its impressive generalization capability, SAM (HQ-SAM) can be a promising candidate for further optimization and application in RFI and event detection tasks in radio astronomy.

          The Influence of a Shock on the Nucleosynthesis Developing during the Explosion of a Low-Mass Neutron Star

 - **Abstract**
 The pattern of nucleosynthesis during the explosion of a low-mass neutron star formed in a close binary system in the stripping scenario is considered. In the scenario considered the shock arising during the explosion is shown to strongly heat the expanding neutron star matter. The heavy nuclei produced at the preceding stage of nucleosynthesis are partially destroyed as a result of a sharp increase in the role of photonuclear reactions. It is shown that even short-term heating of the matter by the shock can exert a noticeable influence on the results of the synthesis of elements in the r-process in the inner crust matter, while explosive nucleosynthesis gives rise to new elements in the outer crust matter with mass numbers A from 50 to 130.

          The Dust Extinction Curve: Beyond R(V)

 - **Abstract**
 The dust extinction curve is typically parameterized by a single variable, R(V), in optical and near-infrared wavelengths. R(V) controls the slope of the extinction-vs.-wavelength curve, and is thought to reflect the grain-size distribution and composition of dust. Low-resolution, flux-calibrated BP/RP spectra from Gaia have allowed the determination of the extinction curve along sightlines to 130 million stars in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. We show that these extinction curves contain more than a single degree of freedom - that is, that they are not simply described by R(V). We identify a number of components that are orthogonal to R(V) variation, and show that these components vary across the sky in coherent patterns that resemble interstellar medium structure. These components encode variation in the 770 nm extinction feature, intermediate-scale and very broad structure, and a newly identified feature at 850 nm, and likely trace both dust composition and local conditions in the interstellar medium. Correlations of the 770 nm and 850 nm features with R(V) suggest that their carriers become more abundant as the carrier of the 2175 Angstrom feature is destroyed. Our 24 million extinction-curve decompositions and feature equivalent-width measurements are publicly available at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 The $\delta$-Cancrid meteoroid stream forms four active meteor showers which are observable on the Earth annually during January-February and August-September. The stream's definite parent comet has not been established. We performed a search for near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) associated with this stream. We have followed the backward evolution of the orbital elements of a sample of NEAs and found their orbits at the Earth-crossing positions. Using these orbits, we alculated the theoretical parameters of meteor showers associated with the considered NEAs. We carried out our search for observable active showers that match theoretically predicted ones with published data, and the result turned out that the predicted meteor showers of 13 NEAs were identified with the active showers produced by the $\delta$-Cancrid meteoroid stream. The comet-like orbits of NEAs and established association with active meteor showers indicate their common cometary origin. The NEAs considered are moving within the stream and likely represent the dormant remnants of a parent comet of the $\delta$-Cancrid asteroid-meteoroid complex disintegrated more than 12 thousand years ago.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the discovery of a very prominent mid-infrared (18-25 {\mu}m) excess associated with the trans-Neptunian dwarf planet (136472) Makemake. The excess, detected by the MIRI instrument of the James Webb Space Telescope, along with previous measurements from the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes, indicates the occurrence of temperatures of about 150 K, much higher than what solid surfaces at Makemake's heliocentric distance could reach by solar irradiation. We identify two potential explanations: a continuously visible, currently active region, powered by subsurface upwelling and possibly cryovolcanic activity, covering <1% of Makemake's surface, or an as yet undetected ring containing very small carbonaceous dust grains, which have not been seen before in trans-Neptunian or Centaur rings. Both scenarios point to unprecedented phenomena among trans-Neptunian objects and could greatly impact our understanding of these distant worlds.

 - **Abstract**
 We evaluate the impact of the rotation on the stochastic excitation of acoustic (p) modes in solar-like pulsators. First, we derive the forced wave equation taking rotation into account and we compute the source terms, which inject energy into the oscillations. We make use of the Rotating Mixing Length Theory (R-MLT) to assess how the convective root mean square velocities are modified by the Coriolis acceleration. Finally, we use the stellar structure and evolution code MESA combined with the stellar pulsation code GYRE to show that the resulting modes amplitudes are inhibited by rotation.

 - **Abstract**
 OT 081 is a well-known, luminous blazar that is remarkably variable in many energy bands. We present the first broadband study of the source which includes very-high-energy (VHE, $E>$100\,GeV) $\gamma$-ray data taken by the MAGIC and H.E.S.S. imaging Cherenkov telescopes. The discovery of VHE $\gamma$-ray emission happened during a high state of $\gamma$-ray activity in July 2016, observed by many instruments from radio to VHE $\gamma$-rays. We identify four states of activity of the source, one of which includes VHE $\gamma$-ray emission. Variability in the VHE domain is found on daily timescales. The intrinsic VHE spectrum can be described by a power-law with index $3.27\pm0.44_{\rm stat}\pm0.15_{\rm sys}$ (MAGIC) and $3.39\pm0.58_{\rm stat}\pm0.64_{\rm sys}$ (H.E.S.S.) in the energy range of 55--300\,GeV and 120--500\,GeV, respectively. The broadband emission cannot be sucessfully reproduced by a simple one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model. Instead, an additional external Compton component is required. We test a lepto-hadronic model that reproduces the dataset well and a proton-synchrotron dominated model that requires an extreme proton luminosity. Emission models that are able to successfully represent the data place the emitting region well outside of the Broad Line Region (BLR) to a location at which the radiative environment is dominated by the infrared thermal radiation field of the dusty torus. In the scenario described by this flaring activity, the source appears to be an FSRQ, in contrast with past categorizations. This suggests that the source can be considered to be a transitional blazar, intermediate between BL~Lac and FSRQ objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova shocks into dense molecular cores in IC 443 (clumps B, C, and G) and 3C 391 were observed using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy and complemented by archival data from the Herschel Space Observatory. The pure rotational transitions 0-0 S(1) and S(5) of H2, and the ground-state 110-101 transition of H2O, are all broadened, arising from molecules that survive the passage of the shock front. Theoretical models from the Paris-Durham shock code were analyzed to generate synthetic profiles that approximately match the observations. The observations can be fit with two shock conditions, which approximate the range of densities in the pre-shock molecular cloud. The width and brightness of the S(5) lines require shocks into gas with a density of order 2,000 cm-3, into which the IC 443 blast wave drives shocks with speed 60 km/s. The brightness and narrower width of the S(1) lines requires different shocks, into gas with density of order 10^5 cm-3, with shock speeds of 10 km/s. The H2O velocity distribution is also consistent with these shocks. The existence of shocks into dense gas shows that the bright shocked clumps in IC~443 were prestellar cores. It is unlikely that they will form stars soon after the passage of the shock front, given the input of kinetic and thermal energy from the shocks.

 - **Abstract**
 Maser emission of SiO, H$_2$O and, OH is widespread in Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars with oxygen(O)-rich envelopes. This emission quickly disappear during the post-AGB phase and is extremely rare in planetary nebulae (PN). So far, only eight PNe have been confirmed to show OH and/or H$_2$O maser emission, and none has ever been found to show SiO maser emission. We intend to obtain the first detection of a SiO maser from a PNe. Such a detection would provide us with a useful tool to probe mass-loss in PNe at a scales of a few AU from the central star, much shorter than the scales traced by H$_2$ or OH masers. We compiled two different samples. The first one comprises all known PNe with confirmed OH and/or H$_2$O maser emission, as well as two candidate PNe showing OH masers. For the second sample we compiled single-dish SiO maser detections in the literature, and compared them with catalogs of PNe and radio continuum emission (which could trace photoionized gas in a PNe). We identified five targets (either PN or radio continuum sources) within the beam of the single-dish SiO maser observations. We then carried out interferometric observations of both samples with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, to confirm the spatial association between continuum and SiO maser emission. We found no SiO maser emission associated with any confirmed or candidate PN. In all targets, except IRAS 17390$-$3014, there is no spatial coincidence between SiO masers and radio continuum emission. While in IRAS 17390$-$3014 we cannot completely rule out a possible association, it is unlikely that the radio continuum emission arises from a planetary nebula. The absence of SiO maser emission in PNe showing OH or H$_2$O masers is of special interest, since thermal SiO emission has been reported in at least one of these targets, indicating that SiO molecules can be present in gas phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We report a detailed timing and spectral analysis of the X-ray pulsar 2S~1417-624 using the data from Insight-HXMT during the 2018 outburst. The pulse profiles are highly variable with respect to both unabsorbed flux and energy. A double-peaked pulse profile from the low flux evolved to a multi-peaked shape in the high-flux state. The pulse fraction is negatively correlated to the source flux in the range of $\sim$(1--6)$\ \times \ 10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, consistent with \textit{Rossi} X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) studies during the 2009 giant outburst. The energy-resolved pulse profiles around the peak outburst showed a four-peak shape in the low-energy bands and gradually evolved to triple peaks at higher energies. The continuum spectrum is well described by typical phenomenological models, such as the cut-off power law and the power law with high-energy cut-off models. Notably, we discovered high-energy cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) for the first time, which are around 100 keV with a statistical significance of $\sim$7$\sigma$ near the peak luminosity of the outburst. This CRSF line is significantly detected with different continuum models and provides very robust evidence for its presence. Furthermore, pulse-phase-resolved spectroscopy confirmed the presence of the line, whose energy varied from 97 to 107 keV over the pulse phase and appeared to have a maximum value at the narrow peak phase of the profiles.

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying stars belonging to different classes is vital in order to build up statistical samples of different phases and pathways of stellar evolution. In the era of surveys covering billions of stars, an automated method of identifying these classes becomes necessary. Many classes of stars are identified based on their emitted spectra. In this paper, we use a combination of the multi-class multi-label Machine Learning (ML) method XGBoost and the PySSED spectral-energy-distribution fitting algorithm to classify stars into nine different classes, based on their photometric data. The classifier is trained on subsets of the SIMBAD database. Particular challenges are the very high sparsity (large fraction of missing values) of the underlying data as well as the high class imbalance. We discuss the different variables available, such as photometric measurements on the one hand, and indirect predictors such as Galactic position on the other hand. We show the difference in performance when excluding certain variables, and discuss in which contexts which of the variables should be used. Finally, we show that increasing the number of samples of a particular type of star significantly increases the performance of the model for that particular type, while having little to no impact on other types. The accuracy of the main classifier is ~0.7 with a macro F1 score of 0.61. While the current accuracy of the classifier is not high enough to be reliably used in stellar classification, this work is an initial proof of feasibility for using ML to classify stars based on photometry.

          Approximate model for the coupling of far-field wavefront errors and jitter in space-based gravitational wave laser interferometry

 - **Abstract**
 Space-based gravitational wave observatories, such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, employ long-baseline laser interferometry, necessitating displacement measurement sensitivity at 1 pm/$\sqrt{Hz}$ level. A significant challenge in achieving this precision is the coupling noise arising from far-field wavefront errors (WFE) and laser pointing jitter. This paper presents a comprehensive noise model that incorporates three critical factors: transmitted WFE, static pointing angle, and laser beam jitter. Utilizing the Nijboer-Zernike diffraction theory, we derive an approximate expression for far-field WFE, ensuring minimal error and efficient computational performance. The approximate expression has convincing physical interpretability and reveals how various Zernike aberrations and their coupling impact far-field WFE. Furthermore, the study identifies that correcting optical axis deviations induced by $Z_3^{\pm1}$ through beam tilt exacerbates far-field WFE, underscoring the necessity for active suppression of $Z_3^{\pm1}$. The proposed model facilitates detailed system simulations of the laser link, evaluates Tilt-to-Length (TTL) noise, and offers theoretical insights for system optimization.

          Broad-band, high-gain, low-frequency Antennas for Radio Detection of Earth-skimming Tau Neutrinos

 - **Abstract**
 A promising approach to detect high-energy tau neutrinos is through the measurement of impulsive radio emission from horizontal air showers initiated in the Earth's atmosphere. Observations at frequencies between 30 and 80 MHz seem particularly promising -- if high-gain antennas focused at the horizon and blocking out as much as possible of the noisy sky are employed. Due to the large wavelengths, however, designing an antenna with the required properties is highly non-trivial at such low frequencies. In this article, we explore suitable antenna designs that provide the desired high gain, possess a smooth beam, are insensitive to ground conditions, are easily impedance-matched over the wide band, and are mechanically simple for deployment in large numbers in inaccessible terrain. In particular, we consider the "rhombus" antenna design for both horizontally and vertically polarized radiation a very attractive option for tau neutrino detection efforts in the atmosphere with the radio technique.

          Very-high-energy gamma rays from cosmic rays escaping from Galactic black hole binaries

 - **Abstract**
 We solve the cosmic-ray diffusion around a Galactic black hole binary (microquasars) by considering the finite size of the escape region and the continuous cosmic-ray injection. We find that the energy spectrum of escaping cosmic rays in the gamma-ray emission region is described by a broken power law spectrum with one or two spectral breaks even though the total spectrum of escaping cosmic rays is a single power law spectrum. Using the solution for the diffusion equation, we construct a unified picture that explains spatially extended very-high-energy gamma rays from five microquasars observed by HAWC and LHAASO. In the unified picture, all five microquasars have the same energy spectrum of the escaping CRs, $dN/dE \propto E^{-2}$, the same diffusion coefficient, and the same emission region. The hard energy spectrum without the high-energy cutoff supports the idea that the origin of Galactic CRs beyond PeV energies is Galactic black hole binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 MU Cas is a detached eclipsing binary containing two B5 V stars in an orbit of period 9.653 d and eccentricity 0.192, which has been observed in seven sectors using the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We use these new light curves together with published spectroscopic results to measure the physical properties of the component stars, finding masses of 4.67 +/- 0.09 Msun and 4.59 +/- 0.08 Msun, and radii of 4.12 +/- 0.04 Rsun and 3.65 +/- 0.05 Rsun. These values agree with previous results save for a change in which of the two stars is designated the primary component. The measured distance to the system, 1814 +/- 37 pc, is 1.8$\sigma$ shorter than the distance from the Gaia DR3 parallax. A detailed spectroscopic analysis of the system is needed to obtain improved temperature and radial velocity measurements for the component stars; a precise spectroscopic light ratio is also required for better measurement of the stellar radii. MU Cas matches the predictions of theoretical stellar evolutionary models for a solar chemical composition and an age of 87 +/- 5 Myr. No evidence for pulsations was found in the light curves.

 - **Abstract**
 Current models of chemical evolution during star and planetary formation rely on the presence of dust grains to act as a third body. However, they generally ignore the reactivity of the dust grains themselves. Dust grains present in the protoplanetary phase will evolve as the solar system forms and, after protoplanets have appeared, they will be constantly delivered to their surfaces in the form of large aggregates or meteorites. Chondritic meteorites are mostly unaltered samples of the dust present in the first stages of the Solar System formation, that still arrive nowadays to the surface of Earth and allow us to study the properties of the materials forming the early Solar System. These materials contain, amongst others, transition metals that can potentially act as catalysts, as well as other phases that can potentially react in different astrophysical conditions, such as FeS. In this work, we present the reactivity of chondritic meteorites under \hydrogen-rich atmospheres, particularly towards the reduction of FeS for the formation of H2S and metallic Fe during the early phases of the planetary formation. We present the obtained results on the reaction rates and the percentage of FeS available to react in the materials. Additionally, we include a computational study of the reaction mechanism and the energetics. Finally, we discuss the implications of an early formation of H2S in planetary surfaces.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrometry is one of the oldest branches of astronomy which measures the position, the proper motion and parallax of celestial objects. Following the Hipparcos and Gaia missions that have measured several billions of them using global astrometry, we propose to increase astrometry precision on pointed objects using differential astrometry in a large field in order to unravel rocky planets in habitable zones of stars in the Sun vicinity and investigate the nature of dark matter in galactic environments as recommended by the ESA Senior Committee in the Voyager 2050 prospective. Substantial technology developments in a number of critical areas is needed in order to reach the highest required precision of sub-micro-arcsecond. One of them is CMOS image sensors using the stitching technique to merge the multiple design structures on the wafer and produce array with very large number of pixels. Another one is to calibrate the pixel positions using projecting modulating interferometric laser fringes on the array. Finally, the distortion of the optical system can be monitored and compensated using reference stars as metrology sources. The final precision depends on the diameter and the field of view of the telescope that is used as well as the time spent on each target. We present here the science goals that can be achieved with such missions either within the framework of an ESA Medium-class mission or even in the NASA most challenging Habitable Worlds Observatory, a large space telescope recommended by the American Astronomy and Astrophysics prospective for the 2020s and designed specifically to search for signs of life on planets orbiting other stars.

          Evidence for a Sharp CO Snowline Transition in a Protoplanetary Disk and Implications for Millimeter-wave Observations of CO Isotopologues

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of CO isotopologue emission from protoplanetary disks at millimeter wavelengths are a powerful tool for probing the CO snowline, an important marker for disk chemistry, and also for estimating total disk gas mass, a key quantity for planet formation. We use simple models to demonstrate that the vertical thickness of an isothermal layer around the disk midplane has important effects on the CO column density radial profile, with a thick layer producing a sharp CO snowline transition. We simulate ngVLA and ALMA images to show that this sharp change in CO column density can be detected in the derivative of the radial profile of emission from optically thin CO isotopologue lines. We apply this method to archival ALMA observations of the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 in the C$^{17}$O and C$^{18}$O J=1-0 and J=2-1 lines to identify a sharp CO snowline transition near 80 au (0.8 arcsec at 101 pc), and show the CO column density decreases by more than a factor of 20. This finding is consistent with previous inferences from the steep rise of N$_2$H$^+$ emission, which marks the location where CO depletes. We also demonstrate that the disk's thermal structure introduces a significant systematic uncertainty to estimates of total disk gas mass derived from these lines. The substantial improvement in sensitivity envisioned for the ngVLA over ALMA for observations of ground state lines of CO isotopologues has the potential to extend this approach to a much larger population of disks.

          No evidence for a metallicity-dependent enhancement of distant giant companions to close-in small planets in the California Legacy Survey

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the relationship between close-in small planets (CS) and distant giants (DG) is central to understanding the formation of planetary systems like our own. Most studies of this connection have found evidence for a positive correlation, though significant statistical and systematic uncertainties remain due to differences in sample size, target selection bias, and even the definitions of `close-in small' and `distant giant' planets. Recently, Bryan & Lee (2024) conducted a study of 184 stars hosting super-Earths ($M \sin i = 1-20 \, M_{E}$ or $R = 1-4 \, R_{E}$) to determine the effect of stellar metallicity on the prevalence of distant giant companions ($M \sin i = 0.5-20 \, M_{Jup}$, $a = 1-10$ AU). They found that such giants are twice as common in the presence of inner planets, but \textit{only} in metal-rich systems: P(DG|CS, [Fe/H]>0) = $28^{+4.9}_{-4.6}\%$ vs. P(DG|[Fe/H]>0) = $14.3 ^{+2.0}_{-1.8}\%$. Further, they found that this correlation disappears for metal-poor stars: P(DG|CS, [Fe/H]$\leq$0) = $4.5^{+2.6}_{-1.9}\%$ vs. P(DG|[Fe/H]$\leq$0) = $5.0^{+1.6}_{-1.3}\%$. We conducted an analogous study to test whether this effect was present in the California Legacy Survey sample. Using the same planet definitions, we did not find evidence for an enhancement in metal-rich systems: P(DG|CS, [Fe/H]>0) = $14^{+12}_{-8}\%$ vs. P(DG|[Fe/H]>0) = $16.4^{+2.5}_{-2.4}\%$. We also found a $2\sigma$ tension between our conditional rate and a 2x enhancement. The discrepancy between our findings and theirs may arise from a variety of sources, underscoring the need for large exoplanet surveys to overcome both small number statistics and sample inhomogeneities.

 - **Abstract**
 In Adil et al. 2023, we reported an increasing trend in $S_8$ with effective redshift $z_{\textrm{eff}}$ based on $f \sigma_8(z)$ constraints over the redshift range $0 \lesssim z \lesssim 2$, and predicted that this trend would be observable in independent datasets. Recently, the studies by Artis et al. and the ACT+DESI collaboration appeared, presenting data that aligns with the expected trends. In this letter, we quantify the statistical significance of the increasing $S_8$ trends in recent studies by fitting a linear model to estimate the slope $\Delta\,S_8/\Delta\, z_{\textrm{eff}}$, and comparing the results to mock simulations. We find probabilities of $p = 0.0163$ and $p = 0.01893$, corresponding to approximately $2.1\sigma$ for each dataset. Using Fisher's method to combine the independent probabilities, we obtained $p=0.0027$ ($2.8 \sigma$). When we incorporate our earlier findings, the combined statistical significance reaches between $3\sigma$ and $3.7\sigma$. This letter continues a series of studies initiated in 2020 that explore redshift-dependent $\Lambda$CDM parameters as an indication of a breakdown in the standard cosmological model.

 - **Abstract**
 We study a flaring activity of the HSP Mrk421 that was characterized from radio to very-high-energy (VHE; E $>0.1$TeV) gamma rays with MAGIC, Fermi-LAT, Swift, XMM-Newton and several optical and radio telescopes. These observations included, for the first time for a gamma-ray flare of a blazar, simultaneous X-ray polarization measurements with IXPE. We find substantial variability in both X-rays and VHE gamma rays throughout the campaign, with the highest VHE flux above 0.2 TeV occurring during the IXPE observing window, and exceeding twice the flux of the Crab Nebula. However, the VHE and X-ray spectra are on average softer, and the correlation between these two bands weaker that those reported in previous flares of Mrk421. IXPE reveals an X-ray polarization degree significantly higher than that at radio and optical frequencies. The X-ray polarization angle varies by $\sim$100$^\circ$ on timescales of days, and the polarization degree changes by more than a factor 4. The highest X-ray polarization degree reaches 26%, around which a X-ray counter-clockwise hysteresis loop is measured with XMM-Newton. It suggests that the X-ray emission comes from particles close to the high-energy cutoff, hence possibly probing an extreme case of the Turbulent Extreme Multi-Zone model. We model the broadband emission with a simplified stratified jet model throughout the flare. The polarization measurements imply an electron distribution in the X-ray emitting region with a very high minimum Lorentz factor, which is expected in electron-ion plasma, as well as a variation of the emitting region size up to a factor of three during the flaring activity. We find no correlation between the fluxes and the evolution of the model parameters, which indicates a stochastic nature of the underlying physical mechanism. Such behaviour would be expected in a highly turbulent electron-ion plasma crossing a shock front.

 The first all-sky, high-resolution, 3D map of the optical extinction curve of the Milky Way (Zhang & Green 2024) revealed an unexpected steepening of the extinction curve in the moderate-density, "translucent" interstellar medium (ISM). We argue that this trend is driven by growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) through gas-phase accretion. We find a strong anti-correlation between the slope of the optical extinction curve -- parameterized by $R(V)$ -- and maps of PAH abundance -- parameterized by $q_{\rm PAH}$ -- derived from infrared emission. The range of observed $q_{\rm PAH}$ indicates PAH growth by a factor of $\sim$2 between $A_V \simeq 1$ and 3. This implies a factor-of-two stronger 2175 Angstrom feature, which is sufficient to lower $R(V)$ by the observed amount. This level of PAH growth is possible given rapid accretion timescales and the depletion of carbon in the translucent ISM. Spectral observations by JWST would provide a definitive test of this proposed explanation of $R(V)$ variation.

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of next-generation radio interferometers like the Square Kilometer Array promises to revolutionise our radio astronomy observational capabilities. The unprecedented volume of data these devices generate requires fast and accurate image reconstruction algorithms to solve the ill-posed radio interferometric imaging problem. Most state-of-the-art reconstruction methods lack trustworthy and scalable uncertainty quantification, which is critical for the rigorous scientific interpretation of radio observations. We propose an unsupervised technique based on a conformalized version of a radio-augmented equivariant bootstrapping method, which allows us to quantify uncertainties for fast reconstruction methods. Noticeably, we rely on reconstructions from ultra-fast unrolled algorithms. The proposed method brings more reliable uncertainty estimations to our problem than existing alternatives.

 - **Abstract**
 Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) is a prominent mechanism for energizing charged particles up to very large rigidities at astrophysical collisionless shocks. In addition to ions and electrons, it has been proposed that interstellar dust grains could also be accelerated through diffusive shock acceleration, for instance, at supernova remnants (SNRs). Considering interstellar dust grains of various size and composition, we investigate the possibility of grain acceleration at young SNR shocks (throughout the free expansion and Sedov-Taylor phases) and the maximum energies reached by the accelerated grains. We investigate the potential implications on the abundance of refractory species relative to volatile elements in the cosmic-ray composition. We rely on semi-analytical descriptions of particle acceleration at strong shocks, and on self-similar solutions for the dynamics of SNR shock waves. For simplicity, type Ia thermonuclear SNRs expanding in uniform interstellar medium are considered. We find that the acceleration of dust grains at relativistic speed is possible, up to Lorentz factor of $\sim 10^{2}$, kinetic energy $E_{\rm k}/\text{nuc}\sim 10^2$ GeV/nuc for the smaller grains of size $a\sim 5 \times 10^{-7}$ cm. We find that the subsequent sputtering of grains can produce nuclei with a rigidity sufficient to be injected in the process of diffusive shock acceleration. Such scenario can help naturally account for the overabundance of refractory elements in the Galactic cosmic-ray composition, provided that a fraction $\eta \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ of dust grains swept up by a SNR are energized through DSA.

 - **Abstract**
 The majority of massive stars are located in binary or multiple star systems. This poses additional challenges to quantitative analyses that use model atmospheres because little information is currently available on the chemical composition of such systems. The members of the quadruple star system HD 37061, which excites the H II region Messier 43 in Orion, are fully characterised. Accurate and precise abundances for all elements with lines traceable in the optical spectrum are derived for the first time. A hybrid non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) approach, using line-blanketed hydrostatic model atmospheres computed with the ATLAS12 code in combination with non-LTE line-formation calculations with DETAIL and SURFACE, was employed. A high-resolution composite spectrum was analysed for the atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances of the individual stars. Fundamental stellar parameters were derived based on stellar evolution tracks, and the interstellar reddening was characterised. We determined the fundamental parameters and chemical abundances for three stars in the HD 37061 system. The fourth and faintest star in the system shows no distinct spectral features, as a result of its fast rotation. However, this star has noticeable effects on the continuum. The derived element abundances and determined ages of the individual stars are consistent with each other, and the abundances coincide with the cosmic abundance standard. We find an excellent agreement between our spectroscopic distance and the Gaia Data Release 3 parallax distance.

 - **Abstract**
 Knowledge of the composition of material that will form planets is crucial to understand planetary diversity and the occurrence of potentially habitable planets. Ultimately, it is the chemistry in circumstellar disks that determines the global make up of planetary systems, as the dust in these disks grows into giant planet cores and rocky planets, the gas becomes incorporated in giant planet atmospheres, and the ices can be delivered to rocky planets by comets and meteorites. With the advent of ALMA a decade ago and the recent launch of JWST, the composition of the disk gas and ice can now be studied in great detail. This review will provide an overview of our current knowledge of the disk chemical structure, focusing on the six elements essential to life on Earth: carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S).

 - **Abstract**
 The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will feature a prominent anisotropic astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave signal, arising from the tens of millions of unresolved mHz white dwarf binaries in the Milky Way: the Galactic foreground. While proper characterization of the Galactic foreground as a noise source will be crucial for every LISA science goal, it is extremely scientifically interesting in its own right, comprising -- along with $\sim10^4$ resolvable white dwarf binaries -- a complete sample of every mHz white dwarf binary in our Galaxy. We present a novel Bayesian analysis of the LISA Galactic foreground that directly treats its anisotropy via astrophysically-motivated templates, allowing for a direct connection between the observed time-modulation of the foreground amplitude and the underlying spatial distribution of the Milky Way. We validate the efficacy of this approach via simulated data and show that it is able to accurately recover the foreground spectrum in the presence of LISA instrumental noise.
