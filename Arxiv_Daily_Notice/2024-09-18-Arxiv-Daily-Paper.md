 - **Abstract**
 The star cluster surrounding the supermassive black hole in the center of Milky Way is probed using the data on the S2 star. The value of precession found at the physics-informed neural networks (PINN) analysis of the S2 data is used to consider the role of the scattering of S2 star on stars of the cluster, described by a random force given by the Holtsmark distribution. The critical value for the star density of the core cluster for which the observed precession value by PINN lies inside 70\% confidence interval (between 15\% and 85\% quantiles) around the median of precession due to scattering, is obtained as n_crit \approx 8.3 10^6 pc^-3, that is at higher star densities the perturbation of the orbit of S2 would exceed the observed one.

 - **Abstract**
 Type IIn supernovae (SNeIIn) are a highly heterogeneous subclass of core-collapse supernovae, spectroscopically characterized by signatures of interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). Here we systematically model the light curves of 142 archival SNeIIn using MOSFiT (the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients). We find that the observed and inferred properties of SNIIn are diverse, but there are some trends. The typical SN CSM is dense ($\sim$10$^{-12}$gcm$^{-3}$) with highly diverse CSM geometry, with a median CSM mass of $\sim$1M$_\odot$. The ejecta are typically massive ($\gtrsim10$M$_\odot$), suggesting massive progenitor systems. We find positive correlations between the CSM mass and the rise and fall times of SNeIIn. Furthermore there are positive correlations between the rise time and fall times and the $r$-band luminosity. We estimate the mass-loss rates of our sample (where spectroscopy is available) and find a high median mass-loss rate of $\sim$10$^{-2}$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$, with a range between 10$^{-4}$--1M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. These mass-loss rates are most similar to the mass loss from great eruptions of luminous blue variables, consistent with the direct progenitor detections in the literature. We also discuss the role that binary interactions may play, concluding that at least some of our SNeIIn may be from massive binary systems. Finally, we estimate a detection rate of 1.6$\times$10$^5$yr$^{-1}$ in the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.
#### Title:
          Effects of secular growth and mergers on the evolution of metallicity gradients and azimuthal variations in a Milky Way-like galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the evolution of the radial profiles and the azimuthal variations of the stellar metallicities from the Vintergatan simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy. We find that negative gradients exist as soon as the disk settles at high redshift, and are maintained throughout the long term evolution of the galaxy, including during major merger events. The inside-out growth of the disk and an overall outward radial migration tend to flatten these gradients in time. Major merger events only have a moderate and short-lived imprint on the [Fe/H] distributions with almost no radial dependence. The reason lies in the timescale for enrichment in Fe being significantly longer than the duration of the starbursts episodes, themselves slower than dynamical mixing during typical interactions. It results that signatures of major mergers become undetectable in [Fe/H] only a few Myr after pericenter passages. We note that considering other tracers like the warm interstellar medium, or monitoring the evolution of the metallicity gradient as a single value instead of a radial full profile could lead to different interpretations, and warn against an oversimplification of this complex problem.

          From coasting to energy-conserving: new self-similar solutions to the interaction phase of strong explosions

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical explosions that contain dense and ram-pressure-dominated ejecta evolve through an interaction phase, during which a forward shock (FS), contact discontinuity (CD), and reverse shock (RS) form and expand with time. We describe new self-similar solutions that apply to this phase and are most accurate in the limit that the ejecta density is large compared to the ambient density. These solutions predict that the FS, CD, and RS expand at different rates in time and not as single temporal power-laws, are valid for explosions driven by steady winds and homologously expanding ejecta, and exist when the ambient density profile is a power-law with power-law index shallower than $\sim 3$ (specifically when the FS does not accelerate). We find excellent agreement between the predictions of these solutions and hydrodynamical simulations, both for the temporal behavior of the discontinuities and for the variation of the fluid quantities. The self-similar solutions are applicable to a wide range of astrophysical phenomena and -- although the details are described in future work -- can be generalized to incorporate relativistic speeds with arbitrary Lorentz factors. We suggest that these solutions accurately interpolate between the initial ``coasting'' phase of the explosion and the later, energy-conserving phase (or, if the ejecta is homologous and the density profile is sufficiently steep, the self-similar phase described in Chevalier 1982),

          Hunting Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter in Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest

 - **Abstract**
 A very pressing question in contemporary physics is the identity of Dark Matter (DM), and one that has not been answered affirmatively to any degree so far. Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are one of the most well-motivated DM candidates. Light enough PBHs have been constrained by either the non-detection of their Hawking radiation itself, or by the non-observation of any measurable effects of this radiation on astrophysical and cosmological observables. We constrain the PBH density by their Hawking radiation effect on the intergalactic medium (IGM) temperature evolution. We use the latest deductions of IGM temperature from Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations. We put constraints on the fraction of PBH DM with masses $5 \times 10^{15}$ g - $10^{17}$ g separately for spinning and non-spinning BHs. We derive constraints by dealing with the heating effects of the astrophysical reionization of the IGM in two ways. In one way, we completely neglect this heating due to astrophysical sources, thus giving us weaker constraints, but completely robust to the reionization history of the universe. In the second way, we utilise some modelling of the ionization and temperature history, and use it to derive more stringent constraints. We find that for non-spinning PBHs of mass $10^{16}$ g, the current measurements can constrain the PBH-density to be $\lesssim$ 0.1% of the total DM. We find that these constraints from the latest Lyman-$\alpha$ forest temperature measurements are competitive, and hence provide a new observable to probe the nature of PBH DM. The systematics affecting Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements are different from other constraining observations, and thus this is a complementary probe.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Computational astronomy has reached the stage where running a gravitational N-body simulation of a stellar system, such as a Milky Way star cluster, is computationally feasible, but a major limiting factor that remains is the ability to set up physically realistic initial conditions. Aims. We aim to obtain realistic initial conditions for N-body simulations by taking advantage of machine learning, with emphasis on reproducing small-scale interstellar distance distributions. Methods. The computational bottleneck for obtaining such distance distributions is the hydrodynamics of star formation, which ultimately determine the features of the stars, including positions, velocities, and masses. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a new method for sampling physically realistic initial conditions from a limited set of simulations using Gaussian processes. Results. We evaluated the resulting sets of initial conditions based on whether they meet tests for physical realism. We find that direct sampling based on the learned distribution of the star features fails to reproduce binary systems. Consequently, we show that physics-informed sampling algorithms solve this issue, as they are capable of generating realisations closer to reality.

          The Sun's Birth Environment: Context for Meteoritics

 - **Abstract**
 Meteorites trace planet formation in the Sun's protoplanetary disk, but they also record the influence of the Sun's birth environment. Whether the Sun formed in a region like Taurus-Auriga with ~10^2 stars, or a region like the Carina Nebula with ~10^6 stars, matters for how large the Sun's disk was, for how long and from how far away it accreted gas from the molecular cloud, and how it acquired radionuclides like 26Al. To provide context for the interpretation of meteoritic data, we review what is known about the Sun's birth environment. Based on an inferred gas disk outer radius ~50-90 AU, radial transport in the disk, and the abundances of noble gases in Jupiter's atmosphere, the Sun's molecular cloud and protoplanetary disk were exposed to an ultraviolet flux G0 ~30-3000 during its birth and first ~10 Myr of evolution. Based on the orbits of Kuiper Belt objects, the Solar System was subsequently exposed to a stellar density ~100 Msol/pc^3 for ~100 Myr, strongly implying formation in a bound cluster. These facts suggest formation in a region like the outskirts of the Orion Nebula, perhaps 2 pc from the center. The protoplanetary disk might have accreted gas for many Myr, but a few x10^5 yr seems more likely. It probably inherited radionuclides from its molecular cloud, enriched by inputs from supernovae and especially Wolf-Rayet star winds, and acquired a typical amount of 26Al.

          SPORES-HWO. II. Limits on Planetary Companions of Future High-contrast Imaging Targets from $>$20 Years of HIRES and HARPS Radial Velocities

 - **Abstract**
 Future large, space-based observatories with starlight suppression technology, e.g., the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), will directly image and characterize nearby Earth-like exoplanets. Prior limits on planet masses and system architectures from radial velocity (RV) measurements of potential exo-Earth hosts are critical to the success of HWO's science goals. Here, we present a uniform analysis of archival RVs from HIRES/Keck and HARPS/ESO of the most promising targets for the HWO exo-Earth survey. We analyze RVs and stellar activity indicators of 90 stars in the NASA ExEP Mission Star List and SPORES-HWO Catalog, finding 33 Keplerian signals associated with known planets and 12 signals associated with stellar activity. We also identify 5 new RV signals that we classify as either planet candidates or sources requiring confirmation, noting that the RV observations are biased toward cooler and less active stars. Assessing the sensitivity of the HIRES and HARPS data, we calculate RV limits ranging from $K_{\rm RV} = 0.6 \,{\rm m\,s}^{-1}$ (HD 10700) to $371 \,{\rm m\,s}^{-1}$ (HD 17925) in the middle of the conservative habitable zone (HZ), corresponding to projected planet masses of $5.4 \,{\rm M_\oplus}$ and $10.6 \,{\rm M_{Jup}}$ for those stars. The median HZ sensitivity limit of our sample is $M_{\rm p} \sin i \simeq 66 \,{\rm M_\oplus}$. This work demonstrates the need for future extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) monitoring of high-priority targets for the next generation of DI missions that will search for habitable extrasolar systems. We advocate for the use of these results in developing future EPRV strategies.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper introduces a novel method for creating spectral time series, which can be used for generating synthetic light curves for photometric classification but also for applications like K-corrections and bolometric corrections. This approach is particularly valuable in the era of large astronomical surveys, where it can significantly enhance the analysis and understanding of an increasing number of SNe, even in the absence of extensive spectroscopic data. methods: By employing interpolations based on optimal transport theory, starting from a spectroscopic sequence, we derive weighted average spectra with high cadence. The weights incorporate an uncertainty factor, for penalizing interpolations between spectra with significant epoch differences and with poor match between the synthetic and observed photometry. results: Our analysis reveals that even with phase difference of up to 40 days between pairs of spectra, optical transport can generate interpolated spectral time series that closely resemble the original ones. Synthetic photometry extracted from these spectral time series aligns well with observed photometry. The best results are achieved in the V band, with relative residuals less than 10% for 87% and 84% of the data for type Ia and II, respectively. For the B, g, R and r bands the relative residuals are between 65% and 87% within the previously mentioned 10% threshold for both classes. The worse results correspond to the i and I bands where, in the case, of SN~Ia the values drop to 53% and 42%, respectively. conclusions: We introduce a new method to construct spectral time series for individual SN starting from a sparse spectroscopic sequence, demonstrating its capability to produce reliable light curves that can be used for photometric classification.

 - **Abstract**
 Approximately one billion years (Gyr) in the future, as the Sun brightens, Earth's carbonate-silicate cycle is expected to drive CO$_2$ below the minimum level required by vascular land plants, eliminating most macroscopic land life. Here, we couple global-mean models of temperature- and CO$_2$-dependent plant productivity for C$_3$ and C$_4$ plants, silicate weathering, and climate to re-examine the time remaining for terrestrial plants. If weathering is weakly temperature-dependent (as recent data suggest) and/or strongly CO$_2$-dependent, we find that the interplay between climate, productivity, and weathering causes the future luminosity-driven CO$_2$ decrease to slow and temporarily reverse, averting plant CO$_2$ starvation. This dramatically lengthens plant survival from 1 Gyr up to $\sim$1.6-1.86 Gyr, until extreme temperatures halt photosynthesis, suggesting a revised kill mechanism for land plants and potential doubling of the future lifespan of Earth's land macrobiota. An increased future lifespan for the complex biosphere may imply that Earth life had to achieve a smaller number of ``hard steps'' (unlikely evolutionary transitions) to produce intelligent life than previously estimated. These results also suggest that complex photosynthetic land life on Earth and exoplanets may be able to persist until the onset of the moist greenhouse transition.

 - **Abstract**
 The way pulsars spin down is not understood in detail, but a number of possible physical mechanisms produce a spin-down rate that scales as a power of the rotation rate ($\dot\nu\propto-\nu^n$), with the power-law index $n$ called the braking index. PSR B0540-69 is a pulsar that in 2011, after 16 years of spinning down with a constant braking index of 2.1, experienced a giant spin-down change and a reduction of its braking index to nearly zero. Here, we show that following this episode the braking index monotonically increased during a period of at least four years and stabilised at ~1.1. We also present an alternative interpretation of a more modest rotational irregularity that occurred in 2023, which was modelled as an anomalous negative step of the rotation rate. Our analysis shows that the 2023 observations can be equally well described as a transient swing of the spin-down rate (lasting ~65 days), and the Bayesian evidence indicates that this model is strongly preferred.

          Short-Lived Gravitational Instability in Isolated Irradiated Discs

 - **Abstract**
 Irradiation from the central star controls the temperature structure in protoplanetary discs. Yet simulations of gravitational instability typically use models of stellar irradiation with varying complexity, or ignore it altogether, assuming heat generated by spiral shocks is balanced by cooling, leading to a self-regulated state. In this paper, we perform simulations of irradiated, gravitationally unstable protoplanetary discs using 3D hydrodynamics coupled with live Monte-Carlo radiative transfer. We find that the resulting temperature profile is approximately constant in time, since the thermal effects of the star dominate. Hence, the disc cannot regulate gravitational instabilities by adjusting the temperatures in the disc. In a 0.1 Solar mass disc, the disc instead adjusts by angular momentum transport induced by the spiral arms, leading to steadily decreasing surface density, and hence quenching of the instability. Thus, strong spiral arms caused by self-gravity would not persist for longer than ten thousand years in the absence of fresh infall, although weak spiral structures remain present over longer timescales. Using synthetic images at 1.3mm, we find that spirals formed in irradiated discs are challenging to detect. In higher mass discs, we find that fragmentation is likely because the dominant stellar irradiation overwhelms the stabilising influence of PdV work and shock heating in the spiral arms.

          Impact of current uncertainties in the 12C+12C nuclear reaction rate on intermediate-mass stars and massive white dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 Recent determinations of the total rate of the 12C+12C nuclear reaction show non-negligible differences with the reference reaction rate commonly used in previous stellar simulations. In addition, the current uncertainties in determining each exit channel constitute one of the main uncertainties in shaping the inner structure of super asymptotic giant branch stars that could have a measurable impact on the properties of pulsating ultra-massive white dwarfs (WDs). We explore how new determinations of the nuclear reaction rate and its branching ratios affect the evolution of WD progenitors. We show that the current uncertainties in the branching ratios constitute the main uncertainty factor in determining the inner composition of ultra-massive WDs and their progenitors. We found that the use of extreme branching ratios leads to differences in the central abundances of 20Ne of at most 17%, which are translated into differences of at most 1.3 and 0.8% in the cooling times and size of the crystallized core. However, the impact on the pulsation properties is small, less than 1 s for the asymptotic period spacing. We found that the carbon burns partially in the interior of ultra-massive WD progenitors within a particular range of masses, leaving a hybrid CONe-core composition in their cores. The evolution of these new kinds of predicted objects differs substantially from the evolution of objects with pure CO cores. Differences in the size of the crystallized core and cooling times of up to 15 and 6%, respectively leading to distinct patterns in the period spacing distribution.

          Alpha-Proton Differential Flow of A Coronal Mass Ejection at 15 Solar Radii

 - **Abstract**
 Alpha-proton differential flow ($V_{\alpha p}$) of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar wind from the Sun to 1 au and beyond could influence the instantaneous correspondence of absolute abundances of alpha particles (He$^{2+}$/H$^{+}$) between solar corona and interplanetary space as the abundance of a coronal source can vary with time. Previous studies based on Ulysses and Helios showed that $V_{\alpha p}$ is negligible within CMEs from 5 to 0.3 au, similar to slow solar wind ($<$ 400 km s$^{-1}$). However, recent new observations using Parker Solar Probe (PSP) revealed that the $V_{\alpha p}$ of slow wind increases to $\sim$60 km s$^{-1}$ inside 0.1 au. It is significant to answer whether the $V_{\alpha p}$ of CMEs exhibits the similar behavior near the Sun. In this Letter, we report the $V_{\alpha p}$ of a CME measured by PSP at $\sim$15 $R_\odot$ for the first time, which demonstrates that the $V_{\alpha p}$ of CMEs is obvious and complex inside 0.1 au while keeps lower than the local Alfvén speed. A very interesting point is that the same one CME duration can be divided into A and B intervals clearly with Coulomb number below and beyond 0.5, respectively. The means of $V_{\alpha p}$ and alpha-to-proton temperature ratios of interval A (B) is 96.52 (21.96) km s$^{-1}$ and 7.65 (2.23), respectively. This directly illustrates that Coulomb collisions play an important role in reducing the non-equilibrium features of CMEs. Our study indicates that the absolute elemental abundances of CMEs also might vary during their propagation.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations show that globular clusters might be among the best places to find millisecond pulsars. However, the globular cluster Terzan 6 seems to be an exception without any pulsar discovered, although its high stellar encounter rate suggests that it harbors dozens of them. We report the discovery of the first radio pulsar, PSR J1751-3116A, likely associated with Terzan 6 in a search of C-band (4-8 GHz) data from the Green Bank Telescope with a spin period of 5.33 ms and dispersion measure, DM$\simeq$383 ${\rm pc~cm^{-3}}$. The mean flux density of this pulsar is approximately 3 ${\rm \mu Jy}$. The DM agrees well with predictions from the Galactic free electron density model, assuming a distance of 6.7 kpc for Terzan 6. PSR J1751-3116A is likely an isolated millisecond pulsar, potentially formed through dynamical interactions, considering the core-collapsed classification and the exceptionally high stellar encounter rate of Terzan 6. This is the highest radio frequency observation that has led to the discovery of a pulsar in a globular cluster to date. While L-band (1-2 GHz) observations of this cluster are unlikely to yield significant returns due to propagation effects, we predict that further pulsar discoveries in Terzan 6 will be made by existing radio telescopes at higher frequencies.

 In this article a new method is proposed for estimating the mass composition of cosmic rays in individual events with energies above $1.25 \times 10^{19}$ eV. It is based on a joint analysis of experimental data and simulation results obtained using the QGSJet-II.04 model for muons with threshold energy $E_{\mu} = 1.0 \times \cos\theta$ GeV in air showers with zenith angles up to 60 degrees. The data from ground-based and underground scintillation detectors of the Yakutsk EAS array were used. Separate groups of nuclei and other primary particles were found.

 - **Abstract**
 We address the critical need for accurate Rosseland mean gas opacities in high-pressure environments, spanning temperatures from 100 K to 32000 K. Current opacity tables from Wichita State University and AESOPUS 2.0 are limited to $\log(R) \le 1$, where $R=\rho\, T_6^{-3}$ in units of $\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}(10^6\mathrm{K})^{-3}$. This is insufficient for modeling very low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and planets with atmospheres exhibiting higher densities and pressures ($\log(R) > 1$). Leveraging extensive databases such as ExoMol, ExoMolOP, MoLLIST, and HITEMP, we focus on expanding the AESOPUS opacity calculations to cover a broad range of pressure and density conditions ($-8 \leq \log(R) \leq +6$). We incorporate the thermal Doppler mechanism and micro-turbulence velocity. Pressure broadening effects on molecular transitions, leading to Lorentzian or Voigt profiles, are explored in the context of atmospheric profiles for exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stars. We also delve into the impact of electron degeneracy and non-ideal effects such as ionization potential depression under high-density conditions, emphasizing its notable influence on Rosseland mean opacities at temperatures exceeding $10,000$ K. As a result, this study expands AESOPUS public web interface for customized gas chemical mixtures, promoting flexibility in opacity calculations based on specific research needs. Additionally, pre-computed opacity tables, inclusive of condensates, are provided. We present a preliminary application to evolutionary models for very low-mass stars.

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we extend the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by incorporating causal viscous dark matter (vDM) modelled using Maxwell-Cattaneo theory and obtain a novel Hubble parameter solution for the model, which can even be extended to incorporate both radiation and baryonic matter components. A detailed and comprehensive analysis of the model is carried out by deriving theoretical constraints on model parameters, comparing the model with the latest observational data sets and validating the behaviour of the model under different thermodynamic laws. Such an in-depth analysis of the model yielded several intriguing results, like the presence of sign-switching bulk viscous pressure which aids both, the decelerated expansion in the early universe and the accelerated expansion in the late universe, possibility of having negative specific entropy rate in the early Universe while still satisfying the covariant second law of thermodynamics, and a correlation between relaxation time parameter and sign-switching redshift. Finally, we propose a unified dark matter (UDM) interpretation for the dark sector in this model and hence showed that, under the said UDM interpretation, this model can satisfy the much-required near equilibrium condition associated with the background dissipative theory both in the early and late phase of the Universe. Based on the NEC trend showcased by the model, we conjuncture that the late-accelerating behaviour of Universe can be viewed as a means for the UDM fluid to attain a global equilibrium state.

 We present here results of numerical simulations of the formation and early evolution of rocky planets through pebble accretion, with an with an emphasis on hydrogen envelope longevity and the composition of the outgassed atmosphere. We model planets with a range in mass from 0.1 to 5 Earth masses that orbit between 0.7 and 1.7 AU. The composition of the outgassed atmosphere is calculated with the partial pressure of free oxygen fit to geophysical models of magma ocean self-oxidation. XUV radiation powered photoevaporation is considered as the main driver of atmospheric escape. We model planets that remain below the pebble isolation mass and hence accrete tenuous envelopes only. We consider slow, medium or fast initial stellar rotation for the temporal evolution of the XUV flux. The loss of the envelope is a key event that allows the magma ocean to crystallise and outgas its bulk volatiles. The atmospheric composition of the majority of our simulated planets is dominated by CO$_2$. Our planets accrete a total of 11.6 Earth oceans of water, the majority of which enters the core. The hydrospheres of planets lighter than the Earth reach several times the mass of the Earth's modern oceans, while the hydrospheres of planets ranging from 1 to 3.5 Earth masses are comparable to those of our planet. However, planets of 4-5 Earth masses have smaller hydrospheres due to trapping of volatiles in their massive mantles. Overall, our simulations demonstrate that hydrogen envelopes are easily lost from rocky planets and that this envelope loss triggers the most primordial partitioning of volatiles between the solid mantle and the atmosphere.

 Context. Stellar activity consists of different phenomena, mainly spots and faculae, and it is one of the main sources of noise in exoplanetary observations because it affects both spectroscopic and photometric observations. If we want to study young active planetary systems we need to model the activity of the host stars in order to remove astrophysical noise from our observational data. Aims. We modelled the contribution of stellar spots in photometric observations. Through the use of multiband photometry, we aim to extract the geometric properties of the spots and constrain their temperature. Methods. We analyzed multiband photometric observations acquired with the 80 cm Marcon telescope of the Osservatorio Polifunzionale del Chianti of V1298 Tau, assuming that the photometric modulation observed in different bands should be due to cold spots. Results. We constrained the effective temperature of the active regions present on the surface of V1298 Tau, which is composed by the contemporary presence of spots and faculae. We tested our hypothesis on solar data, verifying that we measure the size of the dominant active region and its averaged effective temperature.

 - **Abstract**
 The Roman Space Telescope will be a critical mission to demonstrate high-contrast imaging technologies allowing for the characterisation of exoplanets in reflected light. It will demonstrate $10^{-7}$ contrast limits or better at 3--9 $\lambda / D$ separations with active wavefront control for the first time in space. The detection limits for the Coronagraph Instrument are expected to be set by wavefront variations between the science target and the reference star observations. We are investigating methods to use the deformablel mirrors to methodically probe the impact of such variations on the coronagraphic PSF, generating a PSF library during observations of the reference star to optimise the starlight subtraction at post-processing. We are collaborating with STScI to test and validate these methods in lab using the HiCAT tested, a high-contrast imaging lab platform dedicated to system-level developments for future space missions. In this paper, we will present the first applications of these methods on HiCAT.

 - **Abstract**
 Rocky planets may acquire a primordial atmosphere by outgassing of volatiles from their magma ocean. The distribution of O between H$_2$O, CO and CO$_2$ in chemical equilibrium subsequently changes significantly with decreasing temperature. We explore here two chemical models: one where CH$_4$ and NH$_3$ are assumed to be irrevocably destroyed by photolysis, and one where these molecules persist. In the first case, we show that CO cannot co-exist with H$_2$O, since CO oxidizes at low temperatures to form CO$_2$ and H$_2$. In both cases, H escapes from the thermosphere within a few ten million years by absorption of stellar XUV radiation. This escape drives an atmospheric self-oxidation process whereby rocky planet atmospheres become dominated by CO$_2$ and H$_2$O, regardless of their initial oxidation state at outgassing. HCN is considered a potential precursor of prebiotic compounds and RNA. Our oxidizing atmospheres are inefficient at producing HCN by lightning. Instead, we demonstrate that lightning-produced NO, which dissolves as nitrate in the oceans, and interplanetary dust particles may be the main sources of fixed nitrogen to emerging biospheres. Our results highlight the need for origin-of-life scenarios where the first metabolism fixes its C from CO$_2$, rather than from HCN and CO.

 - **Abstract**
 The exoplanet sub-Neptune population currently poses a conundrum. Are small-size planets volatile-rich cores without atmosphere, or are they rocky cores surrounded by H-He envelope? To test the different hypotheses from an observational point of view, a large sample of small-size planets with precise mass and radius measurements is the first necessary step. On top of that, much more information will likely be needed, including atmospheric characterisation and a demographic perspective on their bulk properties. We present the concept and strategy of THIRSTEE, a project which aims at shedding light on the composition of the sub-Neptune population across stellar types by increasing their number and improving the accuracy of bulk density measurements, as well as investigating their atmospheres and performing statistical, demographic analysis. We report the first results of the program, characterising a 2-planet system around the M dwarf TOI-406. We analyse TESS and ground-based photometry, together with ESPRESSO and NIRPS/HARPS RVs to derive the orbital parameters and investigate the internal composition of the 2 planets orbiting TOI-406, which have radii and masses of $R_b = 1.32 \pm 0.12 R_{\oplus}$, $M_b = 2.08_{-0.22}^{+0.23} M_{\oplus}$ and $R_c = 2.08_{-0.15}^{+0.16} R_{\oplus}$, $M_c = 6.57_{-0.90}^{+1.00} M_{\oplus}$, and periods of $3.3$ and $13.2$ days, respectively. Planet b is consistent with an Earth-like composition, while planet c is compatible with multiple internal composition models, including volatile-rich planets without H/He atmospheres. The 2 planets are located in 2 distinct regions in the mass-density diagram, supporting the existence of a density gap among small exoplanets around M dwarfs. With an equilibrium temperature of only 368 K, TOI-406 c stands up as a particularly interesting target for atmospheric characterisation with JWST in the low-temperature regime.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent discovery of gravitational waves (GWs) has opened a new avenue for investigating the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter in compact stars, which is an outstanding problem in astronomy and nuclear physics. In the future, next-generation (XG) GW detectors will be constructed, deemed to provide a large number of high-precision observations. We investigate the potential of constraining the EOS of quark stars (QSs) with high-precision measurements of mass $m$ and tidal deformability $\Lambda$ from the XG GW observatories. We adopt the widely-used bag model for QSs, consisting of four microscopic parameters: the effective bag constant $B_{\rm eff}$, the perturbative quantum chromodynamics correction parameter $a_4$, the strange quark mass $m_s$, and the pairing energy gap $\Delta$. With the help of hierarchical Bayesian inference, for the first time we are able to infer the EOS of QSs combining multiple GW observations. Using the top 25 loudest GW events in our simulation, we find that, the constraints on $B_{\rm eff}$ and $\Delta$ are tightened by several times, while $a_4$ and $m_s$ are still poorly constrained. We also study a simplified 2-dimensional (2-d) EOS model which was recently proposed in literature. The 2-d model is found to exhibit significant parameter-estimation biases as more GW events are analyzed, while the predicted $m$-$\Lambda$ relation remains consistent with the full model.

 - **Abstract**
 The Be/X-ray binary pulsar RX J0440.9+4431 went through a giant outburst in December 2022 with a peak flux of $\sim$2.3 Crab in 15--50 keV. We studied the broad-band timing and spectral properties of RX J0440.9+4431 using four $AstroSat$ observations, where the source transited between subcritical and supercritical accretion regimes. Pulsations were detected significantly above 100 keV. The pulse profiles were found to be highly luminosity- and energy-dependent. A significant evolution in the pulse profile shape near the peak of the outburst indicates a possible change in the accretion mode and beaming patterns of RX J0440.9+4431. The rms pulsed fraction was luminosity- and energy-dependent, with a concave-like feature around 20--30 keV. The depth of this feature varied with luminosity, indicating changes in the accretion column height and proportion of reflected photons. The broad-band continuum spectra were best fitted with a two-component Comptonization model with a blackbody component or a two-blackbody component model with a thermal Comptonization component. A quasi-periodic oscillation at 60 mHz was detected at a luminosity of $2.6 \times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which evolved into 42 mHz at $1.5 \times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The QPO rms were found to be energy dependent with an overall increasing trend with energy. For the first time, we found the QPO frequency varying with photon energy in an X-ray pulsar, which poses a challenge in explaining the QPO with current models such as the Keplarian and beat frequency model. Hence, more physically motivated models are required to understand the physical mechanism behind the mHz QPOs.

          The Impact of Icy Cometary 'Impacts' on Exoplanetary Atmospheres I: Tidally-Locked Terrestrial Exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 Impacts by rocky and icy bodies are thought to have played a key role in shaping the composition of solar system objects, including the Earth's habitability. Hence, it is likely that they play a similar role in exoplanetary systems. We investigate how an icy cometary impact affects the atmospheric chemistry, climate, and composition of an Earth-like, tidally-locked, terrestrial exoplanet, a prime target in the search for a habitable exoplanet beyond our solar system. We couple a cometary impact model which includes thermal ablation and pressure driven breakup with the 3D Earth System Model WACCM6/CESM2, and use this model to investigate the effects of the water and thermal energy delivery associated with an $R=2.5$ km pure water ice cometary impact on an Earth-like atmosphere. We find that water is the primary driver of longer timescale changes to the atmospheric chemistry and composition by acting as a source of opacity, cloud ice, and atmospheric hydrogen/oxygen. The water opacity drives heating at $\sim5\times10^{-4}$ bar, and cooling below, due to a decreased flux reaching the surface. The increase in atmospheric hydrogen and oxygen also drives an increase in the abundance of hydrogen/oxygen rich molecules, with the exception of ozone, whose column density decreases by $\sim10\%$. These atmospheric changes are potentially observable for $\sim$ 1-2 years post-impact, particularly those associated with cloud ice scattering. They also persist, albeit at a much reduced level, to our quasi-steady-state, suggesting that sustained bombardment or multiple large impacts have the potential to shape the composition and habitability of terrestrial exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the potential for improving constraints on gravity by leveraging correlations in the dispersion measure derived from Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) in combination with cosmic shear. Specifically, we focus on Horndeski gravity, inferring the kinetic braiding and Planck mass run rate from a stage-4 cosmic shear mock survey alongside a survey comprising $10^4$ FRBs. For the inference pipeline, we utilise hi_class to predict the linear matter power spectrum in modified gravity scenarios, while non-linear corrections are modelled with HMcode, including feedback mechanisms. Our findings indicate that FRBs can disentangle degeneracies between baryonic feedback and cosmological parameters, as well as the mass of massive neutrinos. Since these parameters are also degenerate with modified gravity parameters, the inclusion of FRBs can enhance constraints on Horndeski parameters by up to $40$ percent, despite being a less significant measurement. Additionally, we apply our model to current FRB data and use the uncertainty in the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation to impose limits on gravity. However, due to the limited sample size of current data, constraints are predominantly influenced by theoretical priors. Despite this, our study demonstrates that FRBs will significantly augment the limited set of cosmological probes available, playing a critical role in providing alternative tests of feedback, cosmology, and gravity. All codes used in this work are made publically available.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic high-energy events with unknown origins, which are observationally divided into two categories, i.e., repeaters and non-repeaters. However, there are potentially a number of non-repeaters that may be misclassified, as repeating bursts are missed due to the limited sensitivity and observation periods, thus misleading the investigation of their physical properties. In this work, we propose a repeater identification method based on the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm and apply the classification to the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) catalog. We find that the spectral morphology parameters, specifically spectral running ($r$), represent the key features for identifying repeaters from the non-repeaters. Also, the results suggest that repeaters are more biased towards narrowband emission, whereas non-repeaters are inclined toward broadband emission. We provide a list of 163 repeater candidates, with $5$ of which are confirmed with an updated repeater catalog from CHIME/FRB. Our findings help to the understanding of the various properties underlying repeaters and non-repeaters, as well as guidelines for future FRB detection and categorization.

 - **Abstract**
 Vision foundation models, which have demonstrated significant potential in many multimedia applications, are often underutilized in the natural sciences. This is primarily due to mismatches between the nature of domain-specific scientific data and the typical training data used for foundation models, leading to distribution shifts. Scientific data often differ substantially in structure and characteristics; researchers frequently face the challenge of optimizing model performance with limited labeled data of only a few hundred or thousand images. To adapt foundation models effectively requires customized approaches in preprocessing, data augmentation, and training techniques. Additionally, each vision foundation model exhibits unique strengths and limitations, influenced by differences in architecture, training procedures, and the datasets used for training. In this work, we evaluate the application of various vision foundation models to astrophysics data, specifically images from optical and radio astronomy. Our results show that using features extracted by specific foundation models improves the classification accuracy of optical galaxy images compared to conventional supervised training. Similarly, these models achieve equivalent or better performance in object detection tasks with radio images. However, their performance in classifying radio galaxy images is generally poor and often inferior to traditional supervised training results. These findings suggest that selecting suitable vision foundation models for astrophysics applications requires careful consideration of the model characteristics and alignment with the specific requirements of the downstream tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 The removal of angular momentum from protostellar systems drives accretion onto the central star and may drive the dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Winds and jets can contribute to removing angular momentum from the disk, though the dominant process remain unclear. To date, observational studies of resolved disk winds have mostly targeted highly inclined disks. We report the detection of extended H2 and [Ne II] emission toward the young stellar object SY Cha with the JWST Mid-InfraRed Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI-MRS). This is one of the first polychromatic detections of extended H2 toward a moderately inclined, i=51.1 degrees, Class II source. We measure the semi-opening angle of the H2 emission as well as build a rotation diagram to determine the H2 excitation temperature and abundance. We find a wide semi-opening angle, high temperature, and low column density for the H2 emission, all of which are characteristic of a disk wind. These observations demonstrate MIRI-MRS's utility in expanding studies of resolved disk winds beyond edge-on sources.

 Despite having different astronomical characteristics, the studies of mira variables and ultra-cool dwarfs frequently show similar red colors, which could cause leading to photometric misclassification. This study uses photometric data from the WISE, 2MASS, and Pan-STARRS surveys to construct color-based selection criteria for red dwarfs, brown dwarfs, and Mira variables. On analyzing the color indices, we developed empirical rules that separate these objects with an overall classification accuracy of approximately 91%-92%. While the differentiation between red dwarfs and both Mira variables and brown dwarfs is effective, challenges remain in distinguishing Mira variables from brown dwarfs due to overlapping color indices. The robustness of our classification technique was validated by a bootstrap analysis, highlighting the significance of color indices in large photometric surveys for stellar classification.

 The SST-1M is a Small-Sized Telescope (SST) designed to provide a cost-effective and high-performance solution for gamma-ray astrophysics, particularly for energies beyond a few TeV. The goal is to integrate this telescope into an array of similar instruments, leveraging its lightweight design, earthquake resistance, and established Davies-Cotton configuration. Additionally, its optical system is designed to function without a protective dome, allowing it to withstand the harsh atmospheric conditions typical of mountain environments above 2000 m. The SST-1M utilizes a fully digitizing camera system based on silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). This camera is capable of digitizing all signals from the UV-optical light detectors, allowing for the implementation of various triggers and data analysis methods. We detail the process of designing, prototyping, and validating this system, ensuring that it meets the stringent requirements for gamma-ray detection and performance. An SST-1M stereo system is currently operational and collecting data at the Ondřejov observatory in the Czech Republic, situated at 500 m. Preliminary results from this system are promising. A forthcoming paper will provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance of the telescopes in detecting gamma rays and operating under real-world conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-light primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $M_{\rm PBH}<5\times 10^8\mathrm{g}$ can dominate transiently the energy budget of the Universe and reheat the Universe through their evaporation taking place before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The isocurvature energy density fluctuations associated to the inhomogeneous distribution of a population of such PBHs can induce an abundant production of GWs due to second-order gravitational effects. In this work, we discuss the effect of primordial non-Gaussianity on the clustering properties of PBHs and study the effect of a clustered PBH population on the spectral shape of the aforementioned induced GW signal. In particular, focusing on local-type non-Gaussianity we find a double-peaked GW signal with the amplitude of the low-frequency peak being proportional to the square of the non-Gaussian parameter $\tau_\mathrm{NL}$. Remarkably, depending on the PBH mass $M_{\rm PBH}$ and the initial abundance of PBHs at formation time, i.e. $\Omega_\mathrm{PBH,f}$, this double-peaked GW signal can lie well within the frequency bands of forthcoming GW detectors, namely LISA, ET, SKA and BBO, hence rendering this signal falsifiable by GW experiments and promoting it as a novel portal probing the primordial non-Gaussianity.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit a quiet 14-day period of solar minimum during January 2008 and track sub-streamer propagating disturbances (PDs) from low heights in STEREO/EUVI to the extended corona through STEREO/COR1 and into STEREO/COR2 along nonradial paths that trace the structure of the underlying streamers. Using our recently developed method for generating nonradial Height-Time profiles of outward PDs (OPDs) and inward PDs (IPDs), we obtained their velocities along the radial and position angle directions. Our analysis of 417 unique OPDs revealed two classes: slow and fast OPDs. Slow OPDs form preferentially at $\approx$1.6 $R_\odot$ closer to the streamer boundaries, with asymmetric occurrence rates, and show speeds of $16.4_{-8.4}^{+26.6}km/s$ at 1.5 $R_\odot$ and accelerate up to $200.1_{-57.9}^{+71.1}km/s$ at 7.5 $R_\odot$. Fast OPDs form preferentially at $\approx$ 1.6 $R_\odot$ and at $\approx$3.0 $R_\odot$ both at the streamer boundaries and slightly more often within them. They show speeds of $87.8_{-24.8}^{+59.1}km/s$ at 1.5 $R_\odot$ up to $197.8_{-46.7}^{+61.8}km/s$ at 7.5 $R_\odot$. IPDs are observed forming at $\approx$1.8 $R_\odot$ with speeds of tens of $km/s$, mostly concentrated in the aftermath of a CME eruption. We present an example in which we show that periodic brightness variations related to OPDs remained in the range of 98 to 128 min, down to $\approx$2.0 $R_\odot$, well within the field of view of COR1. The velocity profiles of slow OPDs for heliocentric height below 3.0 $R_\odot$ show good agreement with speeds more closely related to the bulk solar wind obtained via interplanetary scintillation.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent mid-infrared observations with JWST/MIRI have resulted in the first direct detections of absorption features from silicate clouds in the transmission spectra of two transiting exoplanets, WASP-17 b and WASP-107 b. In this paper, we measure the mid-infrared ($5-12$ $\mu$m) dayside emission spectrum of the benchmark hot Jupiter HD 189733 b with MIRI LRS by combining data from two secondary eclipse observations. We confirm the previous detection of H$_2$O absorption at 6.5 $\mu$m from Spitzer/IRS and additionally detect H$_2$S as well as an absorption feature at 8.7 $\mu$m in both secondary eclipse observations. The excess absorption at 8.7 $\mu$m can be explained by the presence of small ($\sim$0.01 $\mu$m) grains of SiO$_2$[s] in the uppermost layers of HD 189733 b's dayside atmosphere. This is the first direct detection of silicate clouds in HD 189733 b's atmosphere, and the first detection of a distinct absorption feature from silicate clouds on the day side of any hot Jupiter. We find that models including SiO$_2$[s] are preferred by $6-7\sigma$ over clear models and those with other potential cloud species. The high altitude location of these silicate particles is best explained by formation in the hottest regions of HD 189733 b's dayside atmosphere near the substellar point. We additionally find that HD 189733 b's emission spectrum longward of 9 $\mu$m displays residual features not well captured by our current atmospheric models. When combined with other JWST observations of HD 189733 b's transmission and emission spectrum at shorter wavelengths, these observations will provide us with the most detailed picture to date of the atmospheric composition and cloud properties of this benchmark hot Jupiter.

 Recent reports of cosmological parity violation in the 4PCF raises the question of how such violations could be systematically generated. Here we present a constructive procedure to generate arbitrary violations of vectorial and tensorial types on any scale, which is computationally efficient in the squeezed limit. We directly compute their numerical transfer function, and find strong conservation in the linear regime. This procedure spans all squeezed parity violating observables at the 4PCF, following the quadratic estimator classification.

 We develop a transformer-based conditional generative model for discrete point objects and their properties. We use it to build a model for populating cosmological simulations with gravitationally collapsed structures called dark matter halos. Specifically, we condition our model with dark matter distribution obtained from fast, approximate simulations to recover the correct three-dimensional positions and masses of individual halos. This leads to a first model that can recover the statistical properties of the halos at small scales to better than 3% level using an accelerated dark matter simulation. This trained model can then be applied to simulations with significantly larger volumes which would otherwise be computationally prohibitive with traditional simulations, and also provides a crucial missing link in making end-to-end differentiable cosmological simulations. The code, named GOTHAM (Generative cOnditional Transformer for Halo's Auto-regressive Modeling) is publicly available at \url{this https URL}.
