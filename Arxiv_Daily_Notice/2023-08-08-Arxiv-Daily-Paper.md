#### Revisiting the gas-phase chemical rate coefficients at high temperatures  in CLOUDY
 - **Authors:** Gargi Shaw, Gary Ferland, M. Chatzikos
 - **Subjects:** Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)

 - **Abstract**
 A two-body gas-phase reaction rate coefficient can be given by the usual Arrhenius-type formula which depends on temperature. The UMIST Database for Astrochemistry is a widely used database for reaction rate coefficients. They provide fittings for coefficients valid over a particular range of temperatures. The permissible upper-temperature limits vary over a wide range: from 100 K to 41000K. A wide range of temperatures occurs in nature; thus, it requires evaluating the rate coefficients at temperatures outside the range of validity. As a result, a simple extrapolation of the rate coefficients can lead to unphysically large values at high temperatures. These result in unrealistic predictions. Here we present a solution to prevent the gas-phase reaction coefficients from diverging at a very high temperature. We implement this into the spectral synthesis code CLOUDY which operates over a wide range of temperatures from CMB to 10$^{10}$ K subject to different astrophysical environments.
#### Two Candidate Pulsar TeV Halos Identified from Property-Similarity  Studies

 - **Abstract**
 TeV halos have been suggested as a common phenomenon associated with middle-aged pulsars. Based on our recent work on PSR~J0631+1036, we select 3 candidate TeV halos from the first Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) catalog of gamma-ray sources. The corresponding pulsars, given by the positional coincidences and property similarities, are PSR J1958+2846, PSR J2028+3332, and PSR J1849$-$0001. We analyze the GeV $\gamma$-ray data obtained with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard {\it the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope} for the first two pulsars, as the last is gamma-ray quiet. We remove the pulsed emissions of the pulsars from the source regions from timing analysis, and determine that there are no residual GeV emissions in the regions as any possible counterparts to the TeV sources. Considering the previous observational results for the source regions and comparing the two pulsars to Geminga (and Monogem), the LHAASO-detected TeV sources are likely the pulsars' respective TeV halos. We find that the candidate and identified TeV halos, including that of PSR~J1849$-$0001, have luminosites (at 50\,TeV) approximately proportional to the spin-down energy $\dot{E}$ of the pulsars, and the ratios of the former to the latter are $\sim 6\times 10^{-4}$.
#### Learning from Topology: Cosmological Parameter Estimation from the  Large-scale Structure

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02636
 - **Abstract**
 The topology of the large-scale structure of the universe contains valuable information on the underlying cosmological parameters. While persistent homology can extract this topological information, the optimal method for parameter estimation from the tool remains an open question. To address this, we propose a neural network model to map persistence images to cosmological parameters. Through a parameter recovery test, we demonstrate that our model makes accurate and precise estimates, considerably outperforming conventional Bayesian inference approaches.
#### Reconstructing Lyman-$α$ Fields from Low-Resolution Hydrodynamical  Simulations with Deep Learning
 - **Authors:** Cooper Jacobus, Peter Harrington, Zarija Lukić

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02637
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02637
 - **Abstract**
 Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations are a powerful tool for accurately predicting the properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and for producing mock skies that can be compared against observational data. However, the need to resolve density fluctuation in the IGM puts a stringent requirement on the resolution of such simulations which in turn limits the volumes which can be modelled, even on most powerful supercomputers. In this work, we present a novel modeling method which combines physics-driven simulations with data-driven generative neural networks to produce outputs that are qualitatively and statistically close to the outputs of hydrodynamical simulations employing 8 times higher resolution. We show that the Ly-$\alpha$ flux field, as well as the underlying hydrodynamic fields, have greatly improved statistical fidelity over a low-resolution simulation. Importantly, the design of our neural network allows for sampling multiple realizations from a given input, enabling us to quantify the model uncertainty. Using test data, we demonstrate that this model uncertainty correlates well with the true error of the Ly-$\alpha$ flux prediction. Ultimately, our approach allows for training on small simulation volumes and applying it to much larger ones, opening the door to producing accurate Ly-$\alpha$ mock skies in volumes of Hubble size, as will be probed with DESI and future spectroscopic sky surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cameras for Allsky Meteor Surveillance (CAMS) project, funded by NASA starting in 2010, aims to map our meteor showers by triangulating meteor trajectories detected in low-light video cameras from multiple locations across 16 countries in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Its mission is to validate, discover, and predict the upcoming returns of meteor showers. Our research aimed to streamline the data processing by implementing an automated cloud-based AI-enabled pipeline and improve the data visualization to improve the rate of discoveries by involving the public in monitoring the meteor detections. This article describes the process of automating the data ingestion, processing, and insight generation using an interpretable Active Learning and AI pipeline. This work also describes the development of an interactive web portal (the NASA Meteor Shower portal) to facilitate the visualization of meteor radiant maps. To date, CAMS has discovered over 200 new meteor showers and has validated dozens of previously reported showers.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a search for narrowband radio signals over four observing sessions in 2020-2023 with the L-band receiver (1.15-1.73 GHz) of the 100 m diameter Green Bank Telescope. We pointed the telescope in the directions of 62 TESS Objects of Interest, capturing radio emissions from a total of ~11,860 stars and planetary systems in the ~9 arcminute beam of the telescope. All detections were either automatically rejected or visually inspected and confirmed to be of anthropogenic nature. In this work, we also quantified the end-to-end efficiency of radio SETI pipelines with a signal injection and recovery analysis. The UCLA SETI pipeline recovers 94.0% of the injected signals over the usable frequency range of the receiver and 98.7% of the injections when regions of dense RFI are excluded. In another pipeline that uses incoherent sums of 51 consecutive spectra, the recovery rate is ~15 times smaller at ~6%. The pipeline efficiency affects SETI search volume calculations as well as calculations of upper bounds on the number of transmitting civilizations. We developed an improved Drake Figure of Merit for SETI search volume calculations that includes the pipeline efficiency and frequency drift rate coverage. Based on our observations, we found that there is a high probability (94.0-98.7%) that fewer than ~0.014% of stars earlier than M8 within 100 pc host a transmitter that is detectable in our search (EIRP > 10e12 W). Finally, we showed that the UCLA SETI pipeline natively detects the signals detected with AI techniques by Ma et al., 2023.
#### DISCO: An optical instrument to calibrate neutrino detection in complex  media

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02830
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02830
 - **Abstract**
 We present a conceptual design of a high-performance camera system with applications to neutrino detectors, deep sea exploration, and glaciology. The design combines ultra-sensitive cameras with a number of well-calibrated light sources enclosed in a pressure vessel. The instrument will be capable of withstanding extreme environments such as those encountered in Antarctica or the deep ocean, and be deployable as a standalone system that can be retrieved for deep-sea exploration or glaciology. The camera system is designed to be replicated and deployed in multiple detectors, requiring only modest modifications from one detector to another. The instrument combines a number of capabilities essential for neutrino detector calibrations, including characterization of the scattering and absorption properties of the optical medium, measurement of geometries via photogrammetry, and detector surveillance. The ability to deploy the instrument at different detector sites also offers opportunities for cross-calibration efforts. We present the conceptual design of the instrument and describe plans to produce a prototype.
#### Search for the rare interactions of neutrinos from distant point sources  with IceCube Neutrino Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 The recent discovery and evidence of neutrino signals from distant sources, TXS 0506+056 and NGC 1068 respectively, provide opportunities to search for rare interactions of neutrinos that they might encounter on their paths. One potential scenario of interest is the interaction between neutrinos and dark matter, which is invisible and expected to be abundantly spread over the Universe. Various astrophysical observations have implied the existence of dark matter. When high-energy neutrinos from extragalactic sources interact with dark matter during their propagation, their spectra might show suppressions at specific energy ranges, where such interactions occur. These attenuation signatures from the interaction might be measurable on Earth with large neutrino telescopes such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. This analysis is focused on the search for rare interactions of high-energy neutrinos from the IceCube-identified astrophysical neutrino sources with dark matter in sub-GeV masses and several benchmark mediator cases using the upgoing track-like events. In this poster, sensitivity studies about the interaction of neutrinos and dark matter are presented.
#### Snowflakes in a furnace: formation of CO and dust in a recurrent nova  eruption

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of carbon monoxide (CO) and dust, formed under hostile conditions, in recurrent nova V745 Sco about 8.7 days after its 2014 outburst. The formation of molecules or dust has not been recorded previously in the ejecta of a recurrent nova. The mass and temperature of the CO and dust are estimated to be T(CO) = 2250 +/- 250 K, M(CO) = (1 to 5) E-8 solar masses, and T(dust) = 1000 +/- 50 K, M(dust) approximately E-8 to E-9 solar masses respectively. At the time of their detection, the shocked gas was at a high temperature of approximately E+7 K as evidenced by the presence of coronal lines. The ejecta were simultaneously irradiated by a large flux of soft X-ray radiation from the central white dwarf. Molecules and dust are not expected to form and survive in such harsh conditions; they are like snowflakes in a furnace. However, it has been posited in other studies that, as the nova ejecta plow through the red giant's wind, a region exists between the forward and reverse shocks that is cool, dense and clumpy where the dust and CO could likely form. We speculate that this site may also be a region of particle acceleration, thereby contributing to the generation of gamma-rays.
#### Search for dark matter annihilations in the center of the Earth with  IceCube

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of Dark Matter remains one of the most important unresolved questions of fundamental physics. Many models, including the Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), assume Dark Matter to be a particle and predict a weak coupling with Standard Model matter. If Dark Matter particles can scatter off nuclei in the vicinity of a massive object, such as a star or a planet, they may lose kinetic energy and become gravitationally trapped in the center of such objects, including Earth. As Dark Matter accumulates in the center of the Earth, self-annihilation of WIMPs into Standard Model particles can result in an excess of neutrinos coming from the center of the Earth and detectable at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, situated at the geographic South Pole. A search for excess neutrinos from these annihilations has been performed on 10 years of IceCube data, and results have been interpreted in the context of a number of WIMP annihilation channels ($\chi\chi\rightarrow\tau^+\tau^-/W^+W^-/b\bar{b}$) and masses ranging from 10 GeV to 10 TeV. We present the results from this analysis and compare the outcome with previous searches by other experiments. This analysis yields competitive and world-leading results for masses $m_\chi$ > 100 GeV.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02971
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02971
 - **Abstract**
 We review the non-linear statistics of Primordial Black Holes that form from the collapse of over-densities in a radiation dominated Universe. We focus on the scenario in which large over-densities are generated by rare and Gaussian curvature perturbations during inflation. As new results, we show that the mass spectrum follows a power law determined by the critical exponent of the self-similar collapse up to a power spectrum dependent cut-off and, that the abundance related to very narrow power spectrums is exponentially suppressed. Related to this, we discuss and explicitly show that the Press-Schechter approximation, as well as the statistics of mean profiles, lead to wrong conclusions for the abundance and mass spectrum. Finally, we clarify that the transfer function in the statistics of initial conditions for primordial black holes formation (the abundance) does not play a significant role.
#### On the Posch ratio for irradiance in coastal waters and the high seas

 - **Abstract**
 The horizontal irradiance at the sea surface is an informative light pollution indicator to study Artificial Light at Night (ALAN) effects on marine biodiversity (e.g.: zooplankton diel vertical migration). The Posch ratio (PR) for the horizontal irradiance (that is, the ratio of the horizontal irradiance to the zenith radiance) is a useful tool for estimating the irradiance from easily available measurements of the zenith night sky brightness. The PR definition has already been generalized for any pair of linear radiance indicators in any pair of arbitrarily chosen photometric bands, and can also be applied to estimate e.g. the average sky radiance or the radiance at some elevation above the horizon as a function of the radiance in any other direction of the sky. The PR for a single light source depends on the distance from the source, its angular and spectral emission pattern, and the state of the atmosphere. The PR for any set of sources is a linear combination of the individual PRs that each one would produce separately, with weights that can be easily derived from the relative contribution of each source to the zenith radiance. Whereas in populated lands the ALAN PR varies relatively fast from one location to another, due to the particular spatial distribution of lights, in coastal waters and the high seas the light pollution PR is a smooth function of the distance to the shoreline, due to the progressive lack of neighboring sources and the absence of obstacles. In this work we present the fundamental equations of the model and an example of application for the waters surrounding the Iberian Peninsula, North Africa and the West Mediterranean islands.
#### The Surface Array of IceCube-Gen2

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02990
 - **Abstract**
 The science goals of IceCube-Gen2 include multi-messenger astronomy, astroparticle and particle physics. To this end, the observatory will include several detection methods, including a surface array and in-ice optical sensors. The array will have an approximately 8 km$^2$ surface coverage consisting of elevated scintillator panels and radio antennas to detect air showers in the energy range of several 100 TeV to a few EeV. The observatory's design is unique in that the measurements using the surface array can be combined with the observations of $\geq$300 GeV muons, produced in the hadronic cascades, using the optical detectors in the ice. This allows for an enhanced ability to study cosmic-ray and hadronic physics as well as to boost the sensitivity for astrophysical neutrinos from the southern sky by reducing the primary background, atmospheric muons. We will present the baseline design of the surface array and highlight the expected scientific capabilities.
#### Understanding the predication mechanism of deep learning through error  propagation among parameters in strong lensing case

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03032
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03032
 - **Abstract**
 The error propagation among estimated parameters reflects the correlation among the parameters. We study the capability of machine learning of "learning" the correlation of estimated parameters. We show that machine learning can recover the relation between the uncertainties of different parameters, especially, as predicted by the error propagation formula. Gravitational lensing can be used to probe both astrophysics and cosmology. As a practical application, we show that the machine learning is able to intelligently find the error propagation among the gravitational lens parameters (effective lens mass $M_{L}$ and Einstein radius $\theta_{E}$) in accordance with the theoretical formula for the singular isothermal ellipse (SIE) lens model. The relation of errors of lens mass and Einstein radius, (e.g. the ratio of standard deviations $\mathcal{F}=\sigma_{\hat{ M_{L}}}/ \sigma_{\hat{\theta_{E}}}$) predicted by the deep convolution neural network are consistent with the error propagation formula of SIE lens model. As a proof-of-principle test, a toy model of linear relation with Gaussian noise is presented. We found that the predictions obtained by machine learning indeed indicate the information about the law of error propagation and the distribution of noise. Error propagation plays a crucial role in identifying the physical relation among parameters, rather than a coincidence relation, therefore we anticipate our case study on the error propagation of machine learning predictions could extend to other physical systems on searching the correlation among parameters.
#### Machine learning methods for the search for L&T brown dwarfs in the data  of modern sky surveys

 - **Abstract**
 According to various estimates, brown dwarfs (BD) should account for up to 25 percent of all objects in the Galaxy. However, few of them are discovered and well-studied, both individually and as a population. Homogeneous and complete samples of brown dwarfs are needed for these kinds of studies. Due to their weakness, spectral studies of brown dwarfs are rather laborious. For this reason, creating a significant reliable sample of brown dwarfs, confirmed by spectroscopic observations, seems unattainable at the moment. Numerous attempts have been made to search for and create a set of brown dwarfs using their colours as a decision rule applied to a vast amount of survey data. In this work, we use machine learning methods such as Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost, SVM Classifier and TabNet on PanStarrs DR1, 2MASS and WISE data to distinguish L and T brown dwarfs from objects of other spectral and luminosity classes. The explanation of the models is discussed. We also compare our models with classical decision rules, proving their efficiency and relevance.
#### An Updated Reference Frame for the Galactic Inner Parsec

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared observations of stellar orbits about Sgr A* probe the mass distribution in the inner parsec of the Galaxy and provide definitive evidence for the existence of a massive black hole. However, the infrared astrometry is relative and is tied to the radio emission from Sgr A* using stellar SiO masers that coincide with infrared-bright stars. To support and improve this two-step astrometry, we present new astrometric observations of 15 stellar SiO masers within 2 pc of Sgr A*. Combined with legacy observations spanning 25.8 years, we re-analyze the relative offsets of these masers from Sgr A* and measure positions and proper motions that are significantly improved compared to the previously published reference frame. Maser positions are corrected for epoch-specific differential aberration, precession, nutation, and solar gravitational deflection. Omitting the supergiant IRS 7, the mean position uncertainties are 0.46 mas and 0.84 mas in RA and Dec., and the mean proper motion uncertainties are 0.07 mas yr$^{-1}$ and 0.12 mas yr$^{-1}$, respectively. At a distance of 8.2 kpc, these correspond to position uncertainties of 3.7 AU and 6.9 AU and proper motion uncertainties of 2.7 km s$^{-1}$ and 4.6 km s$^{-1}$. The reference frame stability, the uncertainty in the variance-weighted mean proper motion of the maser ensemble, is 8 $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$ (0.30 km s$^{-1}$) in RA and 11 $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$ (0.44 km s$^{-1}$) in Dec., which represents a 2.3-fold improvement over previous work and a new benchmark for the maser-based reference frame.

 - **Abstract**
 We report non-destructive 3-dimensional imaging and analysis techniques for material returned by the Stardust cometary collector. Our technique utilizes 3-dimensional laser scanning confocal microscopy (3D LSCM) to image whole Stardust tracks, in situ, with attainable resolutions <90 nm/pixel edge. LSCM images illustrate track morphology and fragmentation history; image segmentation techniques provide quantifiable volumetric and dynamic measurements. We present a method for multipart image acquisition and registration in 3-D. Additionally, we present a 3D deconvolution method for aerogel, using a theoretically calculated point spread function for first-order corrections of optical aberrations induced by light diffraction and refractive index mismatches. LSCM is a benchtop technique and is an excellent alternative to synchrotron x-ray computed microtomography for optically transparent media. Our technique, developed over the past 2 years, is a non-invasive, rapid technique for fine-scale imaging of high value returned samples from the Stardust mission, as well as various other samples from the geosciences.

 - **Abstract**
 Djerfisherite is an important carrier of potassium in highly reduced enstatite chondrites, where it occurs in sub-round metal-sulfide nodules. These nodules were once free-floating objects in the protoplanetary nebula. Here, we analyze existing and new data to derive an equation of state (EOS) for djerfisherites of K_{6}(Cu,Fe,Ni)^{B} (Fe,Ni,Cu)^{C}_{24} S_{26}Cl structural formula. We use this EOS to calculate the thermal stability of djerfisherite coexisting in equilibrium with a cooling vapor of solar composition enriched in a dust analogous to anhydrous, chondritic interplanetary dust (C-IDP). We find that condensed mineral assemblages closely match those found in enstatite chondrites, with djerfisherite condensing above 1000 K in C-IDP dust enriched systems. Results may have implications for the volatile budgets of terrestrial planets, and the incorporation of K into early-formed, highly reduced, planetary cores. Previous work links enstatite chondrites to the planet Mercury, where the surface has a terrestrial K/Th ratio, high S/Si ratio, and very low FeO content. Mercury's accretion history may yield insights into Earth's.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the history of planetary exploration, atmospheric entry vehicles have been used to deliver probes and landers to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Titan. While the entry vehicles are tools for furthering scientific exploration, by delivering probes and landers which perform in-situ exploration, the entry vehicle and trajectory design in itself is of significant interest. Entering an atmosphere subjects the vehicle to deceleration and aerodynamic heating loads which the vehicle must withstand to deliver the probe or the lander inside the atmosphere. The conditions encountered depend on the destination, the atmosphere-relative entry speed, the vehicle type, ballistic coefficient, the vehicle geometry, and the entry-flight path angle. The driving constraints are the peak aerodynamic deceleration, peak heat rate, and the total heat load encountered during the critical phase of the entry. Jupiter presents the most extreme entry conditions, while Titan presents the most benign entry environment. This study presents a survey of the design trade space for atmospheric entry missions across the Solar System using carpet plots, along with benchmarks from historical missions, which can serve as a useful reference for designing future missions.

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia DR3 mission has provided orbital parameter estimations for about 440,000 binary systems, offering a valuable resource for searching binaries including a compact component. By combining the Gaia DR3 data with radial velocities (RVs) from the LAMOST spectroscopic survey, we identify three wide binaries containing white dwarf or neutron star. For each binary system, we estimate the stellar parameters of the visible companion (either a main-sequence star or a giant) and orbital parameters, and calculate the binary mass function and the minimum mass of the unseen object. Notably, all these unseen objects have a minimum mass in excess of 1.4 solarmass when using the Gaia DR3 orbital solutions. There is no obvious excess observed in the blue/red band of the Gaia DR3 XP spectra, and the LAMOST medium-resolution spectra do not exhibit any prominent double-lined feature. The absence of an additional component in the results of spectral disentangling further suggests the presence of compact objects within these systems.

 RAFGL2591 is a massive star-forming complex in the Cygnus-X region comprising of a cluster of embedded protostars and young stellar objects located at a distance of 3.33 kpc. We investigate low-frequency radio emission from the protostellar jet associated with RAFGL2591 using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 325, 610 and 1280 MHz. For the first time, we have detected radio jet lobes in the E-W direction, labelled as GMRT-1 and GMRT-2. While GMRT-1 displays a flat radio spectral index of $\alpha$ = -0.10 , GMRT-2 shows a steeply negative value $\alpha$ = -0.62 suggestive of non-thermal emission. H$_2$ emission maps show the presence of numerous knots, arcs and extended emission towards the East-West jet, excited by the protostar VLA 3. In addition, we report a few H$_2$ knots in the North-East and South-West for the first time. The radio lobes (GMRT-1, GMRT-2) and H$_2$ emission towards this region are understood in the context of the prominent East-West jet as well as its lesser-known sibling jet in the North-East and South-West direction. To model the radio emission from the lobes, we have employed a numerical model including both thermal and non-thermal emission and found number densities towards these lobes in the range 100 - 1000 cm$^{-3}$ . The misalignment of the East-West jet lobes exhibits a reflection symmetry with a bending of $\sim$ 20$\circ$ . We attempt to understand this misalignment through precession caused by a binary partner and/or a supersonic side wind from source(s) in the vicinity.

 - **Abstract**
 The forecast on a time scale of 1 or 2 hours is crucial for all kind of new generation facilities (ELTs) instrumentation supported by the adaptive optics that will be mainly operated in Service Mode. In a recent study (Masciadri et al. 2020) we have showed that we can forecast the seeing and atmospheric parameters at such short time scales using an autoregressive method achieving unprecedented model accuracies with a substantial gain with respect to forecasts performed the day before (i.e. on longer time scales) obtained with an atmospheric mesoscale model. Equally we showed a gain with respect to the method by persistence using simply real-time measurements in situ on the same short time scale (1-2 hours). The auto-regressive method makes use of the forecasts done with mesoscale atmospheric models and real-time measurements and since 2019 has been implemented in the operational forecast system ALTA Center supporting LBT observations. In this contribution we apply the same approach to the VLT site extending the method to all the main astroclimatic parameters i.e. the seeing, the wavefront coherence time, the isoplanatic angle and the ground layer fraction. We prove that such a method offers unprecedented forecast accuracies for all the astroclimatic parameters with clear gains with respect to the prediction by persistence. Preliminary calculations indicate also better accuracies than those obtained with the machine learning based approach using in situ measurements. We will apply soon such a method in an operational forecast system that we conceived for the VLT.

 - **Abstract**
 Mitigation of the impact of foreground contributions to measurements of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization is a crucial step in modern CMB data analysis and is of particular importance for a detection of large-scale CMB $B$ modes. A large variety of techniques, based on different assumptions and aiming at either a full component separation or merely cleaning the foreground signals from the CMB maps, have been described in the literature. In this work, we consider this problem within a unified framework based on the maximum likelihood principle, under the assumption that the signal at each frequency can be represented as a linear mixture of sky templates. We discuss the impact of various additional assumptions on the final outcome of the procedure. We find that the component separation problem can be fully solved in two specific situations: when we either know the frequency scaling of all the components or can correctly model them with a limited number of unknown parameters, as is the case in the parametric component separation techniques; or when we either know the statistical properties of all the components, the foregrounds and CMB, or can correctly model them with a limited number of parameters, as for instance in SMICA-like approaches. However, we also show that much less stringent assumptions are sufficient if we only aim at recovering the cleaned CMB signal. In particular, we discuss a ``minimally informed'' non-parametric method based on maximum likelihood. The method only assumes that the component properties are independent on the sky direction, at least over some region of the sky, and that the CMB covariance is known up to some limited number of parameters. We apply this method to recover the CMB $B$ modes polarization signal in the context of forthcoming CMB experiments and compare its performance with that of the standard parametric... (abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are prime candidates for gravitational-wave detectors. The analysis of their complex waveforms can potentially provide information on the physical processes operating during the collapse of the iron cores of massive stars. In this work we analyze the early-bounce rapidly rotating CCSN signals reported in the waveform catalog of Richers et al 2017, which comprises over 1800 axisymmetric simulations extending up to about $10$~ms of post-bounce evolution. It was previously established that for a large range of progenitors, the amplitude of the bounce signal, $\Delta h$, is proportional to the ratio of rotational-kinetic energy to potential energy, T/|W|, and the peak frequency, $f_{\rm peak}$, is proportional to the square root of the central rest-mass density. In this work, we exploit these relations to suggest that it could be possible to use such waveforms to infer protoneutron star properties from a future gravitational wave observation, if the distance and inclination are well known. Our approach relies on the ability to describe a subset of the waveforms in the early post-bounce phase in a simple template form depending only on two parameters, $\Delta h$ and $f_{\rm peak}$. We use this template to perform a Bayesian inference analysis of waveform injections in Gaussian colored noise for a network of three gravitational wave detectors formed by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. We show that it is possible to recover the injected parameters, peak frequency and amplitude, with an accuracy better than 10% for more than 50% of the detectable signals (given known distance and inclination angle). However, inference on waveforms from outside the Richers catalog is not reliable, indicating a need for carefully verified waveforms of the first 10 ms after bounce of rapidly rotating supernovae of different progenitors with agreement between different codes.

 - **Abstract**
 We could accurately predict the shadow path and successfully observe an occultation of a bright star by Chiron on 2022 December 15. The Kottamia Astronomical Observatory in Egypt did not detect the occultation by the solid body, but we detected three extinction features in the light curve that had symmetrical counterparts with respect to the central time of the occultation. One of the features is broad and shallow, whereas the other two features are sharper with a maximum extinction of $\sim$25$\%$ at the achieved spatial resolution of 19 km per data point. From the Wise observatory in Israel, we detected the occultation caused by the main body and several extinction features surrounding the body. When all the secondary features are plotted in the sky plane we find that they can be caused by a broad $\sim$580 km disk with concentrations at radii of 325 \pm 16 km and 423 \pm 11 km surrounding Chiron. At least one of these structures appears to be outside the Roche limit. The ecliptic coordinates of the pole of the disk are $\lambda$ = 151$^\circ~\pm$ 8$^\circ$ and $\beta$ = 18$^\circ~\pm$ 11$^\circ$, in agreement with previous results. We also show our long-term photometry indicating that Chiron had suffered a brightness outburst of at least 0.6 mag between March and September 2021 and that Chiron was still somewhat brighter at the occultation date than at its nominal pre-outburst phase. The outermost extinction features might be consistent with a bound or temporarily bound structure associated with the brightness increase. However, the nature of the brightness outburst is unclear, and it is also unclear whether the dust or ice released in the outburst could be feeding a putative ring structure or if it emanated from it.

 - **Abstract**
 In this Letter, we give a new geometrical interpretation of HI intensity mapping foreground filters in harmonic space, for both single-dish and interferometer mode surveys. We derive the foreground-filtered HI auto power spectrum and then extend this to the cross-power spectrum of HI with CMB lensing. Foreground filtering leads to a loss of isotropy in Fourier space, resulting in harmonic space non-diagonal correlations, which we show are small compared to the diagonal ones. On large scales, foreground filters lead to a major loss of power in the HI$\,\times\,$CMB lensing correlations.
#### ALMA 300 pc resolution imaging of a z=6.79 quasar: no evidence for  supermassive black hole influence on the [C II] kinematics

 - **Abstract**
 We present ALMA [C II] 158 $\mu \rm{m}$ and dust continuum observations of the $z=6.79$ quasar J0109--3047 at a resolution of $0."045$ ($\sim$300 pc). The dust and [C II] emission are enclosed within a $\sim 500\, \rm{pc}$ radius, with the central beam ($r<144\ \rm{pc}$) accounting for $\sim$25\% (8\%) of the total continuum ([C II]) emission. The far--infrared luminosity density increases radially from $\sim$5 $\times 10^{11} L_\odot\ \rm{kpc}^{-2}$ to a central value of $\sim$70 $\times 10^{11} L_\odot\ \rm{kpc}^{-2}$ (SFRD $\sim$50-700 $M_\odot\ \rm{yr}^{-1}\ \rm{kpc}^{-2}$). The [C II] kinematics are dispersion-dominated with a constant velocity dispersion of $137 \pm 6 \,\rm{km\ s}^{-1}$. The constant dispersion implies that the underlying mass distribution is not centrally peaked, consistent with the expectations of a flat gas mass profile. The lack of an upturn in velocity dispersion within the central beam is inconsistent with a black hole mass greater than $M_{\rm{BH}}<6.5\times 10^{8}\ M_\odot\ (2\sigma$ level), unless highly fine-tuned changes in the ISM properties conspire to produce a decrease of the gas mass in the central beam comparable to the black hole mass. Our observations therefore imply either that a) the black hole is less massive than previously measured or b) the central peak of the far-infrared and [C II] emission are not tracing the location of the black hole, as suggested by the tentative offset between the near-infrared position of the quasar and the ALMA continuum emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We universally search for evidence of kinematic and spatial correlation of supernova remnant (SNR) and molecular cloud (MC) associations for nearly all SNRs in the coverage of the MWISP CO survey, i.e. 149 SNRs, 170 SNR candidates, and 18 pure pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) in 1 deg < l < 230 deg and -5.5 deg < b < 5.5 deg. Based on high quality and unbiased 12CO/13CO/C18O (J = 1--0) survey data, we apply automatic algorithms to identify broad lines and spatial correlations for molecular gas in each SNR region. The 91 percent of SNR-MC associations detected previously are identified in this paper by CO line emission. Overall, there could be as high as 80 percent of SNRs associated with MCs. The proportion of SNRs associated with MCs is high within the Galactic longitude less than ~50 deg. Kinematic distances of all SNRs that are associated with MCs are estimated based on systemic velocities of associated MCs. The radius of SNRs associated with MCs follows a lognormal distribution, which peaks at ~8.1 pc. The progenitor initial mass of these SNRs follows a power-law distribution with an index of ~-2.3 that is consistent with the Salpeter index of -2.35. We find that SNR-MC associations are mainly distributed in a thin disk along the Galactic plane, while a small amount distributed in a thick disk. With the height of these SNRs from the Galactic plane below ~45 pc, the distribution of the average radius relative to the height of them is roughly flat, and the average radius increases with the height when above ~45 pc.

 - **Abstract**
 Rare, energetic (long) thermonuclear (Type I) X-ray bursts are classified either as intermediate-duration or superbursts, based on their duration. Intermediate-duration bursts lasting a few to tens of minutes are thought to arise from the thermonuclear runaway of a relatively thick (10^10 g/cm2) helium layer, while superbursts lasting hours are attributed to the detonation of an underlying carbon layer. We present a catalogue of 84 long thermonuclear bursts from 40 low-mass X-ray binaries, and defined from a new set of criteria distinguishing them from the more frequent short bursts. The three criteria are: (1) a total energy release larger than 10^40 erg, (2) a photospheric radius expansion phase longer than 10 s, and (3) a burst time-scale longer than 70 s. This work is based on a comprehensive systematic analysis of 70 bursts found with INTEGRAL, RXTE, Swift, BeppoSAX, MAXI, and NICER, as well as 14 long bursts from the literature that were detected with earlier generations of X-ray instruments. For each burst, we measure its peak flux and fluence, which eventually allows us to confirm the distinction between intermediate-duration bursts and superbursts. Additionally, we list 18 bursts that only partially meet the above inclusion criteria, possibly bridging the gap between normal and intermediate-duration bursts. With this catalogue, we significantly increase the number of long-duration bursts included in the MINBAR and thereby provide a substantial sample of these rare X-ray bursts for further study.

 - **Abstract**
 In circumstellar disks around T Tauri stars, visible and near-infrared stellar irradiation is intercepted by dust at the disk's optical surface and reprocessed into thermal infrared; this subsequently undergoes radiative diffusion through the optically thick bulk of the disk. The gas component -- overwhelmingly dominant by mass, but contributing little to the opacity -- is heated primarily by gas-grain collisions. In hydrodynamical simulations, however, typical models for this heating process (local isothermality, $\beta$-cooling, two-temperature radiation hydrodynamics) incorporate simplifying assumptions that limit their ranges of validity. To build on these methods, we develop a ``three-temperature" numerical scheme, which self-consistently models energy exchange between gas, dust, and radiation, as a part of the PLUTO radiation-hydrodynamics code. With a range of test problems in 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and make the case for its applicability to a wide range of problems in disk physics, including hydrodynamic instabilities and disk-planet interaction.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the low-frequency spectral emission from a network of superconducting cosmic string loops in hopes of explaining the observed radio synchrotron background. After considering constraints from a variety of astrophysical and cosmological measurements, we identify a best-fit solution with string tension $G\mu \simeq 6.5 \times 10^{-12}$ and current $\mathcal{I} \simeq 2.5 \times 10^6$ GeV. This model yields a convincing fit to the data and may be testable in the near future by spectral distortion (TMS, BISOU) and 21 cm experiments (HERA, SKA, REACH). We also find that soft photon heating protects us against current constraints from global $21$ cm experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are becoming popular in cosmology for extracting valuable information from cosmological data. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on matter density snapshots to distinguish clustering Dark Energy (DE) from the cosmological constant scenario and to detect the speed of sound ($c_s$) associated with clustering DE. We compare the CNN results with those from a Random Forest (RF) algorithm trained on power spectra. Varying the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_{\rm{DE}}$ within the range of -0.7 to -0.99, while keeping $c_s^2 = 1$, we find that the CNN approach results in a significant improvement in accuracy over the RF algorithm. The improvement in classification accuracy can be as high as $40\%$ depending on the physical scales involved. We also investigate the ML algorithms' ability to detect the impact of the speed of sound by choosing $c_s^2$ from the set $\{1, 10^{-2}, 10^{-4}, 10^{-7}\}$ while maintaining a constant $w_{\rm DE}$ for three different cases: $w_{\rm DE} \in \{-0.7, -0.8, -0.9\}$. Our results suggest that distinguishing between various values of $c_s^2$ and the case where $c_s^2=1$ is challenging, particularly at small scales and when $w_{\rm{DE}}\approx -1$. However, as we consider larger scales, the accuracy of $c_s^2$ detection improves. Notably, the CNN algorithm consistently outperforms the RF algorithm, leading to an approximate $20\%$ enhancement in $c_s^2$ detection accuracy in some cases.

 - **Abstract**
 Transverse oscillations that do not show significant damping in solar coronal loops are found to be ubiquitous. Recently, the discovery of high-frequency transverse oscillations in small-scale loops has been accelerated by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager onboard Solar Orbiter. We perform a meta-analysis by considering the oscillation parameters reported in the literature. Motivated by the power law of the velocity power spectrum of propagating transverse waves detected with CoMP, we consider the distribution of energy fluxes as a function of oscillation frequencies and the distribution of the number of oscillations as a function of energy fluxes and energies. These distributions are described as a power law. We propose that the power law slope ($\delta=-1.40$) of energy fluxes depending on frequencies could be used for determining whether high-frequency oscillations dominate the total heating ($\delta < 1$) or not ($\delta > 1$). In addition, we found that the oscillation number distribution depending on energy fluxes has a power law slope of $\alpha=1.00$, being less than 2, which means that oscillations with high energy fluxes provide the dominant contribution to the total heating. It is shown that, on average, higher energy fluxes are generated from higher frequency oscillations. The total energy generated by transverse oscillations ranges from about $10^{20}$ to $10^{25}$ erg, corresponding to the energies for nanoflare ($10^{24}-10^{27}$ erg), picoflare ($10^{21}-10^{24}$ erg), and femtoflare ($10^{18}-10^{21}$ erg). The respective slope results imply that high-frequency oscillations could provide the dominant contribution to total coronal heating generated by decayless transverse oscillations.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The advent of wide-band receiver systems on interferometer arrays enables one to undertake high-sensitivity and high-resolution radio continuum surveys of the Galactic plane in a reasonable amount of telescope time. However, to date, there are only a few such studies of the first quadrant of the Milky Way that have been carried out at frequencies below 1 GHz. The Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) has recently upgraded its receivers with wide-band capabilities (now called the uGMRT) and provides a good opportunity to conduct high resolution surveys, while also being sensitive to the extended structures. Aims. We wish to assess the feasibility of conducting a large-scale snapshot survey, the Metrewave Galactic Plane with the uGMRT Survey (MeGaPluG), to simultaneously map extended sources and compact objects at an angular resolution lower than $10''$ and a point source sensitivity of 0.15 mJy/beam. Methods. We performed an unbiased survey of a small portion of the Galactic plane, covering the W43/W44 regions ($l=29^\circ-35^\circ$ and $|b|<1^\circ$) in two frequency bands: 300$-$500 MHz and 550$-$750 MHz. The 200 MHz wide-band receivers on the uGMRT are employed to observe the target field in several pointings, spending nearly 14 minutes on each pointing in two separate scans. We developed an automated pipeline for the calibration, and a semi-automated self-calibration procedure is used to image each pointing using multi-scale CLEAN and outlier fields. Results. We produced continuum mosaics of the surveyed region at a final common resolution of $25''$ in the two bands that have central frequencies of 400 MHz and 650 MHz, with a point source sensitivity better than 5 mJy/beam. We plan to cover a larger footprint of the Galactic plane in the near future based on the lessons learnt from this study. (Abridged)
#### Rearrangement of Granular Surfaces on Asteroids due to Thermal Cycling

 - **Abstract**
 In granular systems, thermal cycling causes compaction, creep, penetration of dense objects, and ratcheting of grains against each other. On asteroid surfaces, thermal cycling is high amplitude and can happen billions of times in a few million years. We use a 1-dimensional thermophysical conductivity model to estimate the relative displacement of grains in proximity to one another, caused by variations in thermal conductivity or shadows. We find that grains would experience relative displacements of order a few microns during each thermal cycle. If thermal cycling causes diffusive transport, then the asteroid's few centimeters deep thermal skin depth could flow a few centimeters in a million years. Thermal cycling could cause long-distance flows on sloped surfaces, allowing fine materials to collect in depressions.
