 - **Abstract**
 Deep learning-based methods have been widely researched in the areas of language and vision, demonstrating their capacity to understand long sequences of data and their usefulness in numerous helio-physics applications. Foundation models (FMs), which are pre-trained on a large-scale datasets, form the basis for a variety of downstream tasks. These models, especially those based on transformers in vision and language, show exceptional potential for adapting to a wide range of downstream applications. In this paper, we provide our perspective on the criteria for designing an FM for heliophysics and associated challenges and applications using the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) dataset. We believe that this is the first study to design an FM in the domain of heliophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 With a temperature of $\sim 285$ K WISE0855 is the coldest brown dwarf observed so far. Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) we obtained observations that allow us to characterize WISE0855s atmosphere focusing on vertical variation in the water steam abundance, measuring trace gas abundances and receiving bulk parameters for this cold object. We observed the ultra cool dwarf WISE0855 using the Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS) onboard JWST at a spectral resolution of up to 3750. We combined the observation with published data from the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) G395M and PRISM modes yielding a spectrum ranging from 0.8 to 22 um. We apply atmospheric retrievals using petitRADTRANS to measure atmospheric abundances, the pressure-temperature structure, radius and gravity of the brown dwarf. We also employ publicly available clear and cloudy self-consistent grid models to estimate bulk properties of the atmosphere such as the effective temperature, radius, gravity and metallicity. Atmospheric retrievals constrain a variable water abundance profile in the atmosphere, as predicted by equilibrium chemistry. We detect the 15NH3 isotopologue and infer a ratio of mass fraction of 14NH3/15NH3 = 332+63-43 for the clear retrieval. We measure the bolometric luminosity by integrating the presented spectrum and obtain a value of log(L/L$_{\odot}$) = -7.291+/-0.008. The detected water depletion indicates that water condenses out in the upper atmosphere due to the very low effective temperature of WISE0855. The height in the atmosphere where this occurs is covered by the MIRI/MRS data, and thus demonstrates the potential of MIRI to characterize cold gas giants atmospheres. Comparing the data to retrievals and self-consistent grid models, we do not detect signs for water ice clouds, although their spectral features have been predicted in previous studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Located 10.888 pc from Earth, COCONUTS-2b is a planetary-mass companion to a young (150--800 Myr) M3 star, with a wide orbital separation (6471 au) and a low companion-to-host mass ratio ($0.021\pm0.005$). We have studied the atmospheric properties of COCONUTS-2b using newly acquired 1.0--2.5~$\mu$m spectroscopy from Gemini/Flamingos-2. The spectral type of COCONUTS-2b is refined to T$9.5 \pm 0.5$ based on comparisons with T/Y dwarf spectral templates. We have conducted an extensive forward-modeling analysis, comparing the near-infrared spectrum and mid-infrared broadband photometry with sixteen state-of-the-art atmospheric model grids developed for brown dwarfs and self-luminous exoplanets near the T/Y transition. The \texttt{PH$_{3}$-free ATMO2020++}, \texttt{ATMO2020++}, and \texttt{Exo-REM} models best match the specific observations of COCONUTS-2b, regardless of variations in the input spectrophotometry. This analysis suggests the presence of disequilibrium chemistry, along with a diabatic thermal structure and/or clouds, in the atmosphere of COCONUTS-2b. All models predict fainter $Y$-band fluxes than observed, highlighting uncertainties in the alkali chemistry models and opacities. We determine a bolometric luminosity of $\log{(L_{\rm bol}/L_{\odot})}=-6.18$ dex, with a 0.5 dex-wide range of $[-6.43,-5.93]$ dex that accounts for various assumptions of models. Using thermal evolution models, we derive an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}=483^{+44}_{-53}$ K, a surface gravity of $\log{(g)}=4.19^{+0.18}_{-0.13}$ dex, a radius of $R=1.11^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ R$_{\rm Jup}$, and a mass of $M=8 \pm 2$ M$_{\rm Jup}$. Various atmospheric model grids consistently indicate that COCONUTS-2b's atmosphere has sub- or near-solar metallicity and C/O. These findings provide valuable insights into COCONUTS-2b's formation history and the potential outward migration to its current wide orbit.

          Expansion properties of the young supernova type Iax remnant Pa 30 revealed

 - **Abstract**
 The recently discovered Pa 30 nebula, the putative type Iax supernova remnant associated with the historical supernova of 1181 AD, shows puzzling characteristics that make it unique among known supernova remnants. In particular, Pa 30 exhibits a complex morphology, with a unique radial and filamentary structure, and it hosts a hot stellar remnant at its center, which displays oxygen-dominated, ultra-fast winds. Because of the surviving stellar remnant and the lack of hydrogen and helium in its filaments, it has been suggested that Pa 30 is the product of a failed thermonuclear explosion in a near- or super-Chandrasekhar white dwarf, which created a sub-luminous transient, a rare sub-type of the Ia class of supernovae called type Iax. We here present a detailed study of the 3D structure and velocities of a full radial section of the remnant. The Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations, obtained with the new red channel of the Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectrograph, reveal that the ejecta are consistent with being ballistic, with velocities close to the free-expansion velocity. Additionally, we detect a large cavity inside the supernova remnant and a sharp inner edge to the filamentary structure, which coincides with the outer edge of a bright ring detected in infrared images. Finally, we detect a strong asymmetry in the amount of ejecta along the line of sight, which might hint to an asymmetric explosion. Our analysis provides strong confirmation that the explosion originated from SN 1181.

          Revisiting the Chemical Composition of WD 1145+017: Impact of Circumstellar Disks Contamination on Photospheric Abundances

 - **Abstract**
 We performed a chemical analysis of the asteroid-bearing white dwarf WD 1145+017 using optical and ultraviolet spectroscopic data from 25 epochs between 2015 and 2023. We present an updated gas disk model with improved opacity calculations and temperature profiles to properly account for all circumstellar absorption features. Incorporating these changes into our models, we identified at least 10 elements in the disk, including a detection of circumstellar Na. We detected 16 elements in the photosphere, including new detections of P, Co and Cu. At 16 elements, WD 1145+017 ties GD 362 as one of the most polluted white dwarfs in terms of the number of elements detected. We find that both the disk and photosphere compositions align, to first order, with CI Chondrite. Our study underscores the importance of accounting for circumstellar absorption, as neglecting them leads to significant abundance errors. Additionally, the analysis of the disk's opacity highlighted a ultraviolet flux reduction due to a pseudo-continuum due to a optically thick component. This result may affect previous analyses of other polluted white dwarfs, suggesting a need for revisiting some studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic-ray flux of positrons is measured with high precision by the space-borne particle spectrometer AMS-02. The hypothesis that pulsars and their nebulae can significantly contribute to the excess of the AMS-02 positron flux has been consolidated after the observation of a $\gamma$-ray emission at GeV and TeV energies of a few degree size around a few sources, that provide indirect evidence that electron and positron pairs are accelerated to very high energies from these sources. By modeling the emission from pulsars in the ATNF catalog, we find that combinations of positron emission from cataloged pulsars and secondary production can fit the observed AMS-02 data. Our results show that a small number of nearby, middle-aged pulsars, particularly B1055-52, Geminga (J0633+1746), and Monogem (B0656+14), dominate the positron emission, contributing up to 80\% of the flux at energies above 100 GeV. From the fit to the data, we obtain a list of the most important sources for which we recommend multi-wavelength follow-up observations, particularly in the $\gamma$-ray and X-ray bands, to further constrain the injection and diffusion properties of positrons.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate classification of transients obtained from spectroscopic data are important to understand their nature and discover new classes of astronomical objects. For supernovae (SNe), SNID, NGSF (a Python version of SuperFit), and DASH are widely used in the community. Each tool provides its own metric to help determine classification, such as rlap of SNID, chi2/dof of NGSF, and Probability of DASH. However, we do not know how accurate these tools are, and they have not been tested with a large homogeneous dataset. Thus, in this work, we study the accuracy of these spectral classification tools using 4,646 SEDMachine spectra, which have accurate classifications obtained from the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey (BTS). Comparing our classifications with those from BTS, we have tested the classification accuracy in various ways. We find that NGSF has the best performance (overall Accuracy 87.6% when samples are split into SNe Ia and Non-Ia types), while SNID and DASH have similar performance with overall Accuracy of 79.3% and 76.2%, respectively. Specifically for SNe Ia, SNID can accurately classify them when rlap > 15 without contamination from other types, such as Ibc, II, SLSN, and other objects that are not SNe (Purity > 98%). For other types, determining their classification is often uncertain. We conclude that it is difficult to obtain an accurate classification from these tools alone. This results in additional human visual inspection effort being required in order to confirm the classification. To reduce this human visual inspection and to support the classification process for future large-scale surveys, this work provides supporting information, such as the accuracy of each tool as a function of its metric.

 - **Abstract**
 Observational constraints on the configuration of the black hole (BH)-accretion disk-jet system are crucial for addressing key questions in black hole growth, accretion disk physics, and jet formation. The recently reported jet precession in M87 provides a novel avenue to explore these long-standing issues. This precession, attributed to the accretion disk's response to the frame-dragging effect of a spinning supermassive black hole (SMBH), indicates a non-zero spin. The relatively short precession period ($\sim$11 years) implies a compact accretion disk. In contrast to the traditional view of a strictly collimated shape, the M87 jet is inferred to curve at the innermost regions connecting to the spinning BH, which explains the unexpectedly wide innermost projected jet width.

          Streaming instabilities in accreting protoplanetary disks: A parameter study

 - **Abstract**
 The streaming instability (SI) is currently the leading candidate for triggering planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks. Recently, a novel variation, the `azimuthal-drift' streaming instability (AdSI), was discovered in disks exhibiting laminar gas accretion. Unlike the classical SI, the AdSI does not require pressure gradients and can concentrate dust even at low abundances. We extend previous simulations of the AdSI to explore the impact of dust abundance, accretion flow strength, pressure gradients, and grain size. For a dimensionless accretion flow strength $\alpha_{\mathrm{M}}=0.1$ and particle Stokes number $\operatorname{St}=0.1$, we find the AdSI produces dust filaments for initial dust-to-gas ratios as low as $\epsilon=0.01$. For $\epsilon\gtrsim 1$, maximum dust-to-gas ratios of order 100 are attained, which can be expected to undergo gravitational collapse. Furthermore, even in systems dominated by the classical SI, an accretion flow drives filament formation, without which the disk remains in a state of small-scale turbulence. Our results suggest that an underlying accretion flow facilitates dust concentration and may thus promote planetesimal formation.

          Hic Sunt Dracones: Uncovering Dynamical Perturbers Within the Habitable Zone

 - **Abstract**
 The continuing exploration of neighboring planetary systems is providing deeper insights into the relative prevalence of various system architectures, particularly with respect to the solar system. However, a full assessment of the dynamical feasibility of possible terrestrial planets within the Habitable Zones (HZ) of nearby stars requires detailed knowledge of the masses and orbital solutions of any known planets within these systems. Moreover, the presence of as yet undetected planets in or near the HZ will be crucial for providing a robust target list for future direct imaging surveys. In this work, we quantify the distribution of uncertainties on planetary masses and semi-major axes for 1062 confirmed planets, finding median uncertainties of 11.1% and 2.2%, respectively. We show the dependence of these uncertainties on stellar mass and orbital period, and discuss the effects of these uncertainties on dynamical analyses and the locations of mean motion resonance. We also calculate the expected radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude for a Neptune-mass planet in the middle of the HZ for each of the proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory target stars. We find that for more than half of these stars, the RV semi-amplitude is less than 1.5 m/s, rendering them unlikely to be detected in archival RV data sets and highlighting the need for further observations to understand the dynamical viability of the HZ for these systems. We provide specific recommendations regarding stellar characterization and RV survey strategies that work toward the detection of presently unseen perturbers within the HZ.

          The Thermal Emission Spectrum of the Nearby Rocky Exoplanet LTT 1445A b from JWST MIRI/LRS

 - **Abstract**
 The nearby transiting rocky exoplanet LTT 1445A b presents an ideal target for studying atmospheric retention in terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarfs. It is cooler than many rocky exoplanets yet tested for atmospheres, receiving a bolometric instellation similar to Mercury's. Previous transmission spectroscopy ruled out a light H/He-dominated atmosphere but could not distinguish between a bare-rock, a high-MMW, or a cloudy atmosphere. We present new secondary eclipse observations using JWST's MIRI/LRS, covering the 5-12 $\mu$m range. From these observations, we detect a broadband secondary eclipse depth of 41 $\pm$ 9 ppm and measure a mid-eclipse timing consistent with a circular orbit (at 1.7$\sigma$). From its emission spectrum, the planet's dayside brightness temperature is constrained to 525 $\pm$ 15 K, yielding a temperature ratio relative to the maximum average dayside temperature from instant thermal reradiation by a rocky surface $R$ = $T_{\rm day,obs}/T_{\rm max}$ = 0.952 $\pm$ 0.057, consistent with emission from a dark rocky surface. From an energy balance perspective, such a warm dayside temperature disfavors thick atmospheres, excluding $\sim$100 bar atmospheres with Bond albedo $>$ 0.08 at the 3$\sigma$ level. Furthermore, forward modeling of atmospheric emission spectra disfavor simple 100\% CO$_2$ atmospheres with surface pressures of 1, 10, and 100 bar at 4.2$\sigma$, 6.6$\sigma$, and 6.8$\sigma$ confidence, respectively. These results suggest that LTT 1445A b lacks a very thick CO$_2$ atmosphere, possibly due to atmospheric erosion driven by stellar activity. However, the presence of a moderately thin atmosphere (similar to those on Mars, Titan, or Earth) remains uncertain.

          TESS Giants Transiting Giants. VII. A Hot Saturn Orbiting an Oscillating Red Giant Star

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of TOI-7041 b (TIC 201175570 b), a hot Saturn transiting a red giant star with measurable stellar oscillations. We observe solar-like oscillations in TOI-7041 with a frequency of maximum power of $\nu_{\rm max} = 218.50\pm2.23$ $\mu$Hz and a large frequency separation of $\Delta\nu = 16.5282\pm0.0186$ $\mu$Hz. Our asteroseismic analysis indicates that TOI-7041 has a radius of $4.10 \pm 0.06$(stat) $\pm$ 0.05(sys) $R_\odot$, making it one of the largest stars around which a transiting planet has been discovered with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and the mission's first oscillating red giant with a transiting planet. TOI-7041 b has an orbital period of $9.691 \pm 0.006$ days and a low eccentricity of $e = 0.04 \pm 0.04$. We measure a planet radius of $1.02 \pm 0.03$ $R_J$ with photometry from TESS, and a planet mass of $0.36 \pm 0.16$ $M_J$ ($114 \pm 51$ $M_\oplus$) with ground-based radial velocity measurements. TOI-7041 b appears less inflated than similar systems receiving equivalent incident flux, and its circular orbit indicates that it is not undergoing tidal heating due to circularization. The asteroseismic analysis of the host star provides some of the tightest constraints on stellar properties for a TESS planet host and enables precise characterization of the hot Saturn. This system joins a small number of TESS-discovered exoplanets orbiting stars that exhibit clear stellar oscillations and indicates that extended TESS observations of evolved stars will similarly provide a path to improved exoplanet characterization.

 - **Abstract**
 M dwarf systems offer a unique opportunity to study terrestrial exoplanetary atmospheres due to their smaller size and cooler temperatures. However, due to the extreme conditions these host stars impose, it is unclear whether their small, close-in rocky planets are able to retain any atmosphere at all. The Hot Rocks Survey aims to answer this question by targeting nine different M dwarf rocky planets spanning a range of planetary and stellar properties. LHS 1478 b orbits an M3-type star, has an equilibrium temperature of Teq = 585 K and experiences an instellation 21 times greater than that of Earth. We observe two secondary eclipses using photometric imaging at 15 um using the Mid-Infrared Instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST MIRI) to measure thermal emission from the dayside of the planet. We then compare these values to different atmospheric scenarios to evaluate potential heat transport and CO2 absorption signatures. We find a secondary eclipse depth of 146 +/- 56 ppm based on the first observation, while the second observation results in a non-detection due to significantly larger unexplained systematics. Based on the first observation alone, we can reject the null hypothesis of the dark (zero Bond albedo) no atmosphere bare rock model with a confidence level of 3.4 sigma. For an airless body with a Bond albedo of A=0.2, the significance decreases to 2.9 sigma. The secondary eclipse depth is consistent with the majority of atmospheric scenarios we considered, which all involve atmospheres which include different concentrations of CO2, and surface pressures from 0.1 to 10 bar. However, we stress that the two observations from our program do not yield consistent results, and more observations are needed to verify our findings. The Hot Rocks Survey serves as a relevant primer for future endeavors such as the Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) Rocky Worlds program.

 - **Abstract**
 Which rocky exoplanets have atmospheres, and which do not? This presumably simply question is the first that must be answered in the pathway toward understanding the prevalence of nearby habitable planets. A mere 6.9 pc from Earth, the LTT 1445A system is the closest transiting M-dwarf system, and its largest known planet, at $\rm 1.31\; R_{\oplus}$ and 424 K, is one of the best rocky targets in which to search for an atmosphere. We use HST/WFC3 transmission spectroscopy with the G280 and G141 grisms to study the spectrum of LTT 1445Ab between $\rm 0.2-1.65\;\mu m$. In doing so, we uncover a flare on the neighboring star LTT 1445C, and report one of the first simultaneous near-UV/optical spectra of an M dwarf flare. The planet spectrum is consistent with a flat line, though the infrared portion displays potential features that could be explained by known opacity sources such as HCN. Some atmospheric retrievals weakly favor ($\sim2\sigma$) an atmosphere over a flat line, but it remains challenging to discern between stellar contamination, an atmosphere, and a featureless spectrum at this time. We do, however, confidently rule out $\leq100\times$ solar metallicity atmospheres. Although stellar contamination retrievals cannot fit the infrared features well, the overall spectrum is consistent with stellar contamination from hot spots, cold spots, or both. Based on the UV/optical data, we place limits on the extent of stellar variability expected in the near-infrared ($30-40$ ppm), which will be critical for upcoming JWST observations of this highly optimal target.

 - **Abstract**
 We observed the ultra hot Jupiter WASP-33b with the Spectro-Polarimètre Infra-Rouge on the Canada Fance Hawaii Telescope. Previous observations of the dayside of WASP-33b show evidence of CO and Fe emission indicative of a thermal inversion. We observed its nightside over five Earth-nights to search for spectral signatures of CO in the planet's thermal emission. Our three pre-transit observations and two post-transit observations are sensitive to regions near the morning or evening terminators, respectively. From spectral retrievals, we detect CO molecular absorption in the planet's emission spectrum after transit at $\sim$6.6$\sigma$. This is the strongest ground-based detection of nightside thermal emission from an exoplanet, and only the third ever. CO appearing in absorption suggests that the nightside near the evening terminator does not have a temperature inversion; this makes sense if the dayside inversion is driven by absorption of stellar radiation. On the contrary, we do not detect CO from the morning terminator. This may be consistent with heat advection by an eastward jet. Phase-resolved high-resolution spectroscopy offers an economical alternative to space-based full-orbit spectroscopic phase curves for studying the vertical and horizontal atmospheric temperature profiles of short-period exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon-rich (C-rich) stars can be found at all metallicities and evolutionary stages. They are often the result of mass-transfer from a companion, but some of the most metal-poor C-rich objects are likely carrying the imprint of the metal-free First Stars from birth. In this work, we employ a neural network to predict metallicities and carbon abundances for over 10 million stars with Gaia low-resolution XP spectra, down to [Fe/H] = -3.0 and up to [C/Fe] $\approx$ +2. We identify ~2000 high-confidence bright (G<16) carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars with [Fe/H] < -2.0 and [C/Fe] > +0.7. The majority of our C-rich candidates have [Fe/H] > -2.0 and are expected to be binary mass-transfer products, supported by high barium abundances in GALAH and/or their Gaia RUWE and radial velocity variations. We confirm previous findings of an increase in C-rich stars with decreasing metallicity, adopting a definition of $3\sigma$ outliers from the [C/Fe] distribution, although our frequency appears to flatten for -3.0 < [Fe/H] < -2.0 at a level of 6-7%. We also find that the fraction of C-rich stars is low among globular cluster stars (connected to their lower binary fraction), and that it decreases for field stars more tightly bound to the Milky Way. We interpret these last results as evidence that disrupted globular clusters contribute more in the inner Galaxy, supporting previous work. Homogeneous samples like these are key to understanding the full population properties of C-rich stars, and this is just the beginning.

 - **Abstract**
 Atomic diffusion with radiative levitation is a major transport process to consider to explain abundance anomalies in Am stars. Radiative accelerations vary from one species to another, yielding different abundance anomalies at the stellar surface. Radiative accelerations can be computed using different methods: some evolution codes use an analytical approximation, while others calculate them from monochromatic opacities. We compared the abundance evolutions predicted using these various methods. Our models were computed with the Toulouse-Geneva evolution code, in which both an analytical approximation (the single-valued parameter method) and detailed calculations from Opacity Project (OP) atomic data are implemented for the calculation of radiative accelerations. The time evolutions of the surface abundances were computed using macroscopic transport processes that are able to reproduce observed Am star surface abundances in presence of atomic diffusion, namely an ad hoc turbulent model or a global mass loss. The radiative accelerations obtained with the various methods are globally in agreement for all the models below the helium convective zone, but can be much greater between the bottom of the hydrogen convective zone and that of helium. The time evolutions of the surface abundances mostly agree within the observational error, but the abundance of some elements can exceed this error for the least massive mass-loss model. The gain in computing time from using analytical approximations is significant compared to sequential calculations from monochromatic opacities for the turbulence models and for the least massive wind model; the gain is small otherwise. Test calculations of turbulence models with the tabulated OPAL opacities yield quite similar abundances as OP for most elements but in a much shorter time, so that determining Am star parameters can be done using a two-step method.

 - **Abstract**
 Knowledge about the internal physical structure of stars is crucial to understanding their evolution. The novel binary population synthesis code POSYDON includes a module for interpolating the stellar and binary properties of any system at the end of binary MESA evolution based on a pre-computed set of models. In this work, we present a new emulation method for predicting stellar profiles, i.e., the internal stellar structure along the radial axis, using machine learning techniques. We use principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction and fully-connected feed-forward neural networks for making predictions. We find accuracy to be comparable to that of nearest neighbor approximation, with a strong advantage in terms of memory and storage efficiency. By delivering more information about the evolution of stellar internal structure, these emulators will enable faster simulations of higher physical fidelity with large-scale simulations of binary star population synthesis possible with POSYDON and other population synthesis codes.

          Spectrum of high-frequency gravitational waves from graviton bremsstrahlung by the decay of inflaton: case with polynomial potential

 - **Abstract**
 We study the generation of high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) through graviton bremsstrahlung during the decay of inflaton in the post-inflationary universe, focusing on scenarios with a polynomial inflaton potential. Two main reheating channels are considered: decays into bosons (spin 0) and fermions (spin $\frac{1}{2}$). We compute the resulting GW spectra from three-body decays, where the inflaton decays into a pair of daughter particles and a graviton. We numerically compute the GW spectra for various polynomial exponents by employing two distinct approaches: one treating the inflaton as a collection of rest particles and the other treating it as a coherently oscillating classical field. In the former approach, only gravitons with energies below half the inflaton mass are produced, while the latter allows for the production of gravitons with arbitrarily high energies when the potential exponent is 4 or greater. This difference arises because the inflaton's oscillations are no longer described by a single harmonic mode but instead consist of infinitely many harmonic modes with different frequencies. As a result, the GW spectrum exhibits multiple peaks, with these peaks being less pronounced for higher powers of the potential. We also examine the dependence of the GW spectrum on the coupling constant between the inflaton and daughter particles. Our findings suggest that future GW detectors targeting GWs in the GHz band, such as resonant cavities, may have the capability to detect these signals, offering potential insights into the reheating phase of the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Bipolar or multipolar lobes in pre-planetary nebulae (pPNe) often exhibit intertwined outer whorled patterns, resulting from stellar wind matter accumulation during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. These structures are likely triggered by stellar or substellar companions. We regard that CW Leonis currently stands at a critical transition moment, providing a vivid illustration of the progression from an AGB star in a binary system to a pPN. We have found that CW Leonis has shown significant enhancements in its optical and near-infrared light curves over the past two decades, with the recent Hubble Space Telescope image finally revealing the long-awaited central star. Utilizing an eccentric-orbit binary model, we can reproduce the position-angle dependence of the expansion velocity in the whorled pattern around CW Leonis, suggesting a nearly face-on orbital inclination. Its contradiction to the features in the innermost circumstellar envelope, corresponding to a nearly edge-on inclination, may imply the presence of an additional companion. Our updated theoretical framework explores the complexity of the whorled pattern. Further identifying and monitoring phase-transition candidates at the tip of the AGB will provide valuable insights into the AGB-pPN transition and the role of companions in shaping the morphological evolution of these stellar objects.

          How does the solar chromospheric activity look like under different inclination angles?

 - **Abstract**
 Chromospheric plages are distributed between mid-latitude and the Equator and never close to the Poles. Therefore, we suspect that the inclination angle of the solar rotation axis has an impact on the observable chromospheric emission. We reproduce the solar images from any inclination in order to study the effect of the inclination axis on the solar variability by using direct observations of the Sun in the Ca II K line. More than 2700 days of observations since the beginning of the Ca II K observations with USET, in July 2012, were used in our analysis. For each observation day, we produce synoptic maps to map the entire solar surface during a full solar rotation. Then by choosing a given inclination, we generate solar-disk views, representing the segmented brightest structures of the chromosphere (plages and enhanced network), as seen under this inclination. The area fraction are extracted from the masks for each inclination and we compare the evolution of those time series to quantify the impact of the inclination angle. We find a variation of the area fraction between an Equator-on view and a Pole-on view. Our results show an important impact of the viewing angle on the detection of modulation due to the solar rotation. With the dense temporal sampling of USET data, the solar rotation is detectable up to an inclination of about $|i| = 70^{\circ}$ and the solar-cycle modulation is clearly detected for all inclinations, though with a reduced amplitude in polar views. When applying a sparse temporal sampling typical for time series of solar-like stars, the rotational modulation is no longer detected, whatever the inclination. On the other hand, we find that the activity-cycle modulation remains detectable as long as the sampling contains at least 20 observations per year and the cycle amplitude reaches at least 30\% of the solar-cycle amplitude.

 This report summarizes what has happened in the mini-workshops entitled ''My Earth in 180 minutes'' organized during the lunch break at the SF2A 2024 conference in Marseille. The project showcased an innovative serious game designed to raise awareness of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in astronomical research laboratories. Participants, organized into teams, simulate strategies to reduce their carbon footprints by 50\%, focusing on key astronomical activities such as space instrumentation, data analysis, and laboratory work. The sessions highlight the challenges of achieving significant emissions reductions without disrupting core research activities, such as telescope observations. While the serious game facilitates important discussions on sustainable practices, the results point to the need for broader engagement, adaptation to different cultural contexts, and institutional support. The project highlights the importance of integrating climate action into the academic environment and suggests potential future directions for expanding its impact.

 - **Abstract**
 Missing frequency channels pose a problem for estimating $P(k_\perp,k_\parallel)$ the redshifted 21-cm power spectrum (PS) from radio-interferometric visibility data. This is particularly severe for the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), which has a periodic pattern of missing channels that introduce spikes along $k_\parallel$. The Tracking Tapered Gridded Estimator (TTGE) overcomes this by first correlating the visibilities in the frequency domain to estimate the multi-frequency angular power spectrum (MAPS) $C_\ell(\Delta\nu)$ that has no missing frequency separation $\Delta\nu$. We perform a Fourier transform along $\Delta\nu$ to estimate $P(k_\perp,k_\parallel)$. Considering our earlier work, simulations demonstrate that the TTGE can estimate $P(k_\perp,k_\parallel)$ without any artifacts due to the missing channels. However, the spikes were still found to persist for the actual data, which is foreground-dominated. The current work presents a detailed investigation considering both simulations and actual data. We find that the spikes arise due to a combination of the missing channels and the strong spectral dependence of the foregrounds. Based on this, we propose and demonstrate a technique to mitigate the spikes. Applying this, we find the values of $P(k_\perp,k_\parallel)$ in the region $0.004 \leq k_\perp \leq 0.048\,{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ and $k_\parallel > 0.35 \,{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ to be consistent with zero within the expected statistical fluctuations. We obtain the $2\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta_{\rm UL}^2(k)=(918.17)^2\,{\rm mK^2}$ at $k=0.404\,{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ for the mean squared brightness temperature fluctuations of the $z=8.2$ epoch of reionization (EoR) 21-cm signal. This upper limit is from just $\sim 17$ minutes of observation for a single pointing direction. We expect tighter constraints when we combine all $162$ different pointing directions of the drift scan observation.

 - **Abstract**
 The precise Doppler method for measuring stellar radial velocities (RV) is a fundamental technique in modern astronomy. This method records a star's spectrum and detects periodic Doppler shifts in its spectral features, which indicate the gravitational influences induced by orbiting companions. The Doppler technique has yielded remarkable successes in exoplanet detection, uncovering a diverse array of planetary systems ranging from hot Jupiters to Neptune-mass planets and super-Earths. Having led to the discovery of over 1100 exoplanets, the RV method is the most effective approach for measuring orbital geometries and minimum masses, which are of fundamental importance when accessing planet formation and evolution scenarios. However, exoplanet detection via precise RV measurements poses significant challenges, including managing various sources of interference, such as instrumental errors, and mitigating spurious Doppler shifts induced by phenomena like stellar activity. Key to this technique's advancement is instrumental calibration methods, notably precise calibration methods and ultra-stable spectrographs. This technique holds promise in systematically exploring the domain of Jovian analogs, rocky and icy planets within the habitable zones of their parent stars, and providing crucial follow-up observations for transiting candidates detected by space missions. The synergy between transit and Doppler measurements of exoplanets, when feasible, has provided a comprehensive set of orbital and physical parameters for exoplanets, such as the dynamical mass and mean planet density, which is enhancing our understanding of their internal composition. Additionally, ongoing efforts aim to improve the RV technique further by developing more stable calibration techniques aimed at detecting Earth-like analogs around Solar-type stars that require cm/s RV precision.

 Strong gravity in the immediate vicinity of compact objects (e.g., black holes, neutron stars) necessitates inclusion of general relativistic effects. Traditionally, pseudo-Newtonian potential representation of gravity were favored to simulate the fluid motion in this region since that reduced the calculation complexity. However, with the advent of easily implementable, reliable numerical algorithms and computer hardware, more and more research groups are shifting towards the numerical solutions of general relativistic fluid dynamics equations. In this work, we report our progress on the development of such simulation tool and present results of sub-Keplerian accretion flow onto black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the unplanned detection of a white dwarf companion to the star HD 218261 in mid-infrared (10-16 $\mu$m) observations with JWST/MIRI. This star was observed as a calibrator for coronagraphic observations of the exoplanet host HR 8799. HD 218261 B has only previously been detected by Gaia, and only in visible light. We confidently detect the companion in the mid-infrared, where it is less luminous than the primary by a factor of ~10$^4$. The visible and mid-infrared photometry are consistent with a white dwarf of $T_\text{eff}\approx10000$ K, $M\approx0.8 M_\odot$, though observation of its optical spectrum is required to precisely constrain its physical parameters. These results demonstrate that precise mid-infrared photometry of white dwarf companions to bright stars can be obtained with MIRI, opening up new possibilities for studying white dwarfs in close binaries.

          Spectroscopically resolved partial phase curve of the rapid heating and cooling of the highly-eccentric Hot Jupiter HAT-P-2b with WFC3

 - **Abstract**
 The extreme environments of transiting close-in exoplanets in highly-eccentric orbits are ideal for testing exo-climate physics. Spectroscopically resolved phase curves not only allow for the characterization of their thermal response to irradiation changes but also unveil phase-dependent atmospheric chemistry and dynamics. We observed a partial phase curve of the highly-eccentric close-in giant planet HAT-P-2b ($e=0.51,M=9M_{\rm{Jup}}$) with the Wide Field Camera 3 aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. Using these data, we updated the planet's orbital parameters and radius, and retrieved high-frequency pulsations consistent with the planet-induced pulsations reported in Spitzer data. We found that the peak in planetary flux occurred at $6.7\pm0.6$ hr after periastron, with a heating and cooling timescales of $9.0^{+3.5}_{-2.1}$ hr, and $3.6^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$ hr, respectively. We compare the light-curve to various 1-dimensional and 3-dimensional forward models, varying the planet's chemical composition. The strong contrast in flux increase and decrease timescales before and after periapse indicates an opacity term that emerges during the planet's heating phase, potentially due to more H$^{-}$ than expected from chemical equilibrium models. The phase-resolved spectra are largely featureless, that we interpret as indicative an inhomogeneous dayside. However, we identified an anomalously high flux in the spectroscopic bin coinciding with the hydrogen Paschen $\beta$ line and that is likely connected to the planet's orbit. We interpret this as due to shock heating of the upper atmosphere given the short timescale involved, or evidence for other star-planet interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 To study the dust dynamics in the dust trapping vortices in the protoplanetary disk around MWC~758, we analyzed the 1.3 mm continuum images of the MWC~758 disk obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in 2017 and 2021. We detect proper motions of 22 mas and 24 mas in the two dust clumps at radii of 0\farcs32 and 0\farcs54 in the disk on the plane of the sky, respectively. On the assumption that the dust clumps are located in the disk midplane, the velocities of the observed proper motions along the azimuthal direction of the inner and outer dust clumps are sub- and super-Keplerian, respectively, and both have angular velocities corresponding to the Keplerian angular velocity at a radius of $0\farcs46\pm0\farcs04$. This deviation from the Keplerian motion is not expected in the conventional theory of vortices formed by the Rossby wave instability. The observed non-Keplerian proper motions of the dust clumps are unlikely due to the disk warp and eccentricity, nor be associated with any predicted planets. The two dust clumps are likely spatially coincident with the infrared spirals. In addition, we detect the changes in the intensity profiles of the dust clumps over the four-year span. Therefore, we suggest that the observed proper motions are possibly due to changes in the density distributions in the dust clumps caused by their interaction with the spirals in the disk.

 Recent studies showed that observations of line emission from shocks in YSO jets require a substantial amount of ionization of the pre-shock matter. Photoionization from X-ray emitted close to the central source may be responsible for the initial ionization fraction. The aim of our work is to study the effect of X-ray photoionization, coming from the vicinity of the central star, on the ionization fraction inside the jet that can be advected at large distances. For this purpose we have performed axisymmetric MHD jet launching simulations including photoionization and optically thin losses using PLUTO. For typical X-ray luminosities in classical T-Tauri stars, we see that the photoionization is responsible for ionizing to 10 % -20 % the jet close to the star.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) are gas giant planets orbiting close to their host star, with equilibrium temperatures exceeding 2000 K, and among the most studied planets in terms of their atmospheric composition. Thanks to a new generation of ultra-stable high-resolution spectrographs, it is possible to detect the signal from the individual lines of the species in the exoplanetary atmospheres. We employed two techniques in this study. First, we used transmission spectroscopy, which involved examining the spectra around single lines of FeII. Then we carried out a set of cross-correlation studies for two UHJs: KELT-9b and KELT-20b. Both planets orbit fast-rotating stars, which resulted in the detection of the strong Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect and center-to-limb variations in the transmission spectrum. These effects had to be corrected to ensure a precise analysis. Using the transmission spectroscopy method, we detected 21 single lines of FeII in the atmosphere of KELT-9b. All of the detected lines are blue-shifted, suggesting strong day-to-night side atmospheric winds. The cross-correlation method leads to the detection of the blue-shifted signal with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 13.46. Our results are in agreement with models based on non-local thermodynamical equilibrium (NLTE) effects, with a mean micro-turbulence of nu_mic = 2.73 +/- 1.5 km/s and macro-turbulence of nu_mac = 8.22 +/- 3.85 km/s. In the atmosphere of KELT-20b, we detected 17 single lines of FeII. Considering different measurements of the systemic velocity of the system, we conclude that the existence of winds in the atmosphere of KELT-20b cannot be determined conclusively. The detected signal with the cross-correlation method presents a S/N of 11.51. The results are consistent with NLTE effects, including means of nu_mic = 3.04 +/- 0.35 km/s and nu_mac = 6.76 +/- 1.17 km/s.

 In this work, we investigate the properties of a population of cool clouds in simulated galaxy outflows. Using data from the CGOLS isolated galaxy simulations, we generate catalogues of $\sim 10^5$ clouds. We describe the impact of two different supernova feedback models -- a centrally concentrated starburst and disk-wide distributed star formation -- on the resulting cloud population. In both cases we find that the mass distribution function $dN/dM \propto M^{-2}$, in good agreement with model predictions of turbulent fragmentation. We explore how cloud properties change with distance from the galaxy and find no qualitative distinction between the two feedback modes, although significant quantitative differences exist in attributes such as the total number of clouds, their densities, etc. We further show that both internal cloud velocities and cloud-cloud relative velocities are described well by properties of turbulent motion, despite significant bulk radial velocities. Finally, we investigate the distribution of cloud sizes in the context of recent theoretical arguments about cloud survival in winds. We find that proposed cloud survival criteria are a good predictor of cloud survival, in both the case where clouds are primarily destroyed and the case where cloud growth occurs in the outflow.

 - **Abstract**
 The mechanism responsible for the prompt gamma-ray emission of a gamma-ray burst continues to remain an enigma. The detailed analysis of the spectrum of GRB 131014A observed by the $Fermi$ gamma ray burst monitor and Large Area Telescope has revealed an unconventional spectral shape that significantly deviates from the typical Band function. The spectrum exhibits three distinctive breaks and an extended power law at higher energies. Furthermore, the lower end of the spectrum aligns with power-law indices greater than -0.5, and in the brightest region of the burst, these values approach +1. The lowest spectral break is thereby found to be consistent with a blackbody. These observed spectral characteristics strongly suggest the radiation process to be inverse Compton scattering in an optically thin region. Applying the empirical fit parameters for physical modeling, we find that the kinetic energy of the GRB jet of bulk Lorentz factor, $\Gamma \sim 400$, gets dissipated just above the photosphere, approximately at a radius of $\sim 10^{14}$ cm. The electrons involved in this process are accelerated to a power-law index of $\delta = -1.5$, and the minimum electron Lorentz factor, $\gamma_{min}$, is approximately $3$. In summary, this study provides a comprehensive identification and detailed modeling of optically thin inverse Compton scattering in the prompt emission of GRB 131014A.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, possible hints of parity violation have been observed in the connected galaxy four-point correlation function. Although the true origin of the signal from the analysis has been debated, should they have a physical origin, they might point to primordial non-Gaussianity and would be evidence of new physics. In this work, we examine the single-field slow-roll model of inflation within chiral scalar-tensor theories of modified gravity. These theories extend the Chern-Simons one by including parity-violating operators containing first and second derivatives of the non-minimally coupled scalar (inflaton) field. This model is capable of imprinting parity-violating signatures in late-time observables, such as the galaxy four-point correlation function. We perform an analysis of the graviton-mediated scalar trispectrum of the gauge-invariant curvature perturbation $\zeta(t,\mathbf{x})$. We estimate that for a set of parameters of the theory it is possible to produce a signal-to-noise ratio for the parity-violating part of the trispectrum of order one without introducing modifications to the single-field slow-roll setup. Even if the signal found in the analysis turns out to be spurious or if no parity violation is ever detected in the galaxy four-point correlation function, our analysis can be used to constrain the free parameters of these theories.

 The dynamical properties of the bodies in the outer Solar System hold information regarding the planets' orbital histories. In early Solar System numerical simulations, where chaos is a primary driver, it is difficult to explore parameter space in a systematic way. In such simulations, stable configurations are hard to come by, and often require special fine-tuning. In addition, it is infeasible to run suites of well-resolved, realistic simulations with massive particles to drive planetary evolution where enough particles remain to represent the transneptunian populations to robustly statistically compare with observations. To complement state of the art full N-body simulations, we develop a method to artificially control each planet's orbital elements independently from each other, which when carefully applied, can be used to test a wider suite of models. We modify two widely used publicly available N-body integrators: (1) the C code, REBOUND and (2) the FORTRAN code, Mercury. We show how the application of specific fictitious forces within numerical integrators can be used to tightly control planetary evolution to more easily explore migration and orbital excitation and damping. This tool allows us to replicate the impact a massive planetesimal disk would have on the planets, without actually including the massive planetesimals, thus decreasing the chaos and simulation runtime. We highlight an appropriate application that shows the impact of Neptune's eccentricity damping and radial outward migration on Uranus' eccentricity

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first spatially-resolved infrared images of supernova remnants (SNRs) in M33 with the unprecedented sensitivity and resolution of JWST. We analyze 43 SNRs in four JWST fields: two covering central and southern M33 with separate NIRCam (F335M, F444W) and MIRI (F560W, F2100W) observations, one $\sim$5 kpc-long radial strip observed with MIRI F770W, and one covering the giant HII region NGC 604 with multiple NIRCam and MIRI broad/narrowband filters. Of the 21 SNRs in the MIRI field, we found three clear detections (i.e., identical infrared and \ha morphologies), and six partial-detections, implying a detection fraction of 43\% in these bands. In contrast, only one SNR (out of 16) is detectable in the NIRCam field. One of the SNRs, L10-080, is a potential candidate for having freshly-formed ejecta dust, based on its size and centrally-concentrated 21 \mum emission. Two SNRs near NGC 604 have strong evidence of molecular (H$_2$) emission at 4.7 \mum, making them the farthest known SNRs with visible molecular shocks. Five SNRs have F770W observations, with the smaller younger objects showing tentative signs of emission, while the older, larger ones have voids. Multi-wavelength data indicate that the clearly-detected SNRs are also among the smallest, brightest at other wavelengths (\ha, radio and X-ray), have the broadest line widths (H$\alpha$ FWHM$\sim$250-350 km/s), and the densest environments. No strong correlation with star-formation histories are seen, with the clearly-detected SNRs having both high-mass ($\sim$35 \Msun) and low-mass ($\lesssim$10 \Msun) progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary population synthesis (BPS) is an essential tool for extracting information about massive binary evolution from gravitational-wave (GW) detections of compact object mergers. It has been successfully used to constrain the most likely permutations of evolution models among hundreds of alternatives, while initial condition models, in contrast, have not yet received the same level of attention. Here, we introduce BOSSA, a detailed initial sampling code including a set of 192 initial condition permutations for BPS that capture both "invariant" and "varying" models, the latter accounting for a possible metallicity- and star formation rate (SFR)-dependence of the initial mass function (IMF); as well as correlations between the initial primary mass, orbital period, mass ratio and eccentricity of binaries. We include 24 metallicity-specific cosmic star formation history (cSFH) models and propose two alternate models for the mass-dependent binary fraction. We build a detailed pipeline for time-evolving BPS, such that each binary has well-defined initial conditions, and we are able to distinguish the contributions from populations of different ages. We discuss the meaning of the IMF for binaries and introduce a refined initial sampling procedure for component masses. We also discuss the treatment of higher-order multiple systems when normalizing a binary sample. In particular, we argue for how a consistent interpretation of the IMF implies that this is not the distribution from which any set of component masses should be independently drawn, and show how the individual IMF of primaries and companions is expected to deviate from the full IMF.
