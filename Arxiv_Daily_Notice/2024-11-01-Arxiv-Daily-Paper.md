#### Title:
          Do Neutron Star Ultra-Luminous X-Ray Sources Masquerade as Intermediate Mass Black Holes in Radio and X-Ray?

 - **Abstract**
 Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) were once largely believed to be powered by super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass black holes, although in some rare cases, ULXs also serve as potential candidates for (sub-Eddington) intermediate mass black holes. However, a total of eight ULXs have now been confirmed to be powered by neutron stars, thanks to observed pulsations, and may act as contaminants for radio/X-ray selection of intermediate mass black holes. Here we present the first comprehensive radio study of seven known neutron star ULXs using new and archival data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope Compact Array, combined with the literature. Across this sample there is only one confident radio detection, from the Galactic neutron star ULX Swift J0243.6+6124. The other six objects in our sample are extragalactic, and only one has coincident radio emission, which we conclude is most likely contamination from a background HII region. We conclude that with current facilities, neutron star ULXs do not produce significant enough radio emission to cause them to be misidentified as radio/X-ray selected intermediate mass black hole candidates. Thus, if background star formation has been properly considered, the current study indicates that a ULX with a compact radio counterpart is not likely to be a neutron star.

          Capturing Turbulence with Numerical Dissipation: a Simple Dynamical Model for Unresolved Turbulence in Hydrodynamic Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Modeling unresolved turbulence in astrophysical gasdynamic simulations can improve the modeling of other subgrid processes dependent on the turbulent structure of gas: from flame propagation in the interiors of combusting white dwarfs to star formation and chemical reaction rates in the interstellar medium, and non-thermal pressure support of circum- and intergalactic gas. We present a simple method for modeling unresolved turbulence in hydrodynamic simulations via tracking its sourcing by local numerical dissipation and modeling its decay into heat. This method is physically justified by the generic property of turbulent flows that they dissipate kinetic energy at a rate set by the energy cascade rate from large scales, which is independent of fluid viscosity regardless of its nature, be it physical or numerical. We calibrate and test our model against decaying supersonic turbulence simulations. Despite its simplicity, the model quantitatively reproduces multiple non-trivial features of the high-resolution turbulence run: the temporal evolution of the average small-scale turbulence, its dependence on spatial scale, and the slope and scatter of the local correlation between subgrid turbulent velocities, gas densities, and local compression rates. As an example of practical applications, we use our model in isolated galactic disk simulations to model locally variable star formation efficiency at the subresolution scale. In the supersonic, star-forming gas, the new model performs comparably to a more sophisticated model where the turbulent cascade is described by explicit subgrid terms. Our new model is straightforward to implement in many hydrodynamic codes used in galaxy simulations as it utilizes already existing infrastructure to implicitly track the numerical dissipation in such codes.

          Towards Understanding the Milky Way's Typicality: Assessing the Chemodynamics of M31's Bulge & Bar, Thick & Thin Discs

 - **Abstract**
 We describe a novel framework to model galaxy spectra with two cospatial stellar populations, such as may represent a bulge & bar or thick & thin disc, and apply it to APOGEE spectra in the inner $\sim$2 kpc of M31, as well as to stacked spectra representative of the northern and southern parts of M31's disc ($R\sim4-7$ kpc). We use a custom M31 photometric decomposition and A-LIST spectral templates to derive the radial velocity, velocity dispersion, metallicity, and $\alpha$ abundance for both components in each spectrum. In the bulge, one component exhibits little net rotation, high velocity dispersion ($\sim$170 km s$^{-1}$), near-solar metallicity, and high $\alpha$ abundance ([$\alpha$/M] = 0.28), while the second component shows structured rotation, lower velocity dispersion ($\sim$121 km s$^{-1}$), and slightly higher abundances ([M/H] = 0.09, [$\alpha$/M] = 0.3). We tentatively associate the first component with the classical bulge and the second with the bar. In the north disc we identify two distinct components: the first with hotter kinematics, lower metallicity, and higher $\alpha$ abundance than the second ([M/H] = 0.1 and 0.39, [$\alpha$/M] = 0.29 and 0.07). These discs appear comparable to the Milky Way's ''thick'' and ''thin'' discs, providing the first evidence that M31's inner disc has a similar chemodynamical structure. We do not identify two distinct components in the south, potentially due to effects from recent interactions. Such multi-population analysis is crucial to constrain galaxy evolution models that strive to recreate the complex stellar populations found in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 The Hadean, once thought to be uninhabitable and tumultuous, has more recently been recontextualized as a clement time in which oceans, land, and life likely appeared on Earth. This non-exhaustive chapter follows multiple threads from planet formation to the origin of life. We place significant emphasis on the solar system context for the Earth, the timing and nature of crustal formation and the evolution of the surface and atmosphere. Several scenarios for prebiotic chemistry are also discussed including atmospheric photochemistry, wet-dry and freeze-thaw cycles, and hydrothermal vent systems. We attempt to draw connections between the large-scale, planetary processes and various origin of life pathways to illustrate possible overlaps and correlations. In detail, we conclude with and discuss the "impact of impacts" to show how asteroid and comet impacts during the Hadean may have affected many of these processes and scenarios, from generating land to altering the chemical composition and oxidation state of the early Earth's atmosphere and surface.

          The SRG/eROSITA diffuse soft X-ray background. I. The local hot bubble in the western Galactic hemisphere

 - **Abstract**
 The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Surveys (eRASSs) combine the advantages of complete sky coverage and the energy resolution provided by the charge couple device and offer the most holistic and detailed view of the diffuse soft X-ray background (SXRB) to date. The first eRASS (eRASS1) was completed at solar minimum, when solar wind charge exchange emission was minimal, providing the clearest view of the SXRB. We aim to extract spatial and spectral information from each constituent of the SXRB in the western Galactic hemisphere, focusing on the local hot bubble (LHB). We extracted and analysed eRASS1 spectra from almost all directions in the western Galactic hemisphere by dividing the sky into equal signal-to-noise bins. We fitted all bins with fixed spectral templates of known background constituents. We find the temperature of the LHB exhibits a north-south dichotomy at high latitudes ($|b|>30^{\circ}$), with the south being hotter, with a mean temperature at $kT=121.8\pm0.6\,$eV and the north at $kT=100.8\pm0.5\,$eV. At low latitudes, the LHB temperature increases towards the Galactic plane, especially towards the inner Galaxy. The LHB emission measure (${\rm EM_{LHB}}$) enhances approximately towards the Galactic poles. The ${\rm EM_{LHB}}$ map shows clear anti-correlation with the local dust column density. In particular, we found tunnels of dust cavities filled with hot plasma, potentially forming a wider network of hot interstellar medium. We also constructed a three-dimensional LHB model from ${\rm EM_{LHB}}$, assuming constant density. The average thermal pressure of the LHB is $P_{\rm thermal}/k=10100^{+1200}_{-1500}\,{\rm cm^{-3}\,K}$, a lower value than typical supernova remnants and wind-blown bubbles. This could be an indication of the LHB being open towards high Galactic latitudes.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce new high-resolution galaxy simulations accelerated by a surrogate model that reduces the computation cost by approximately 75 percent. Massive stars with a Zero Age Main Sequence mass of about 8 solar masses and above explode as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), which play a critical role in galaxy formation. The energy released by CCSNe is essential for regulating star formation and driving feedback processes in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the short integration timesteps required for SNe feedback present significant bottlenecks in star-by-star galaxy simulations that aim to capture individual stellar dynamics and the inhomogeneous shell expansion of SNe within the turbulent ISM. Our new framework combines direct numerical simulations and surrogate modeling, including machine learning and Gibbs sampling. The star formation history and the time evolution of outflow rates in the galaxy match those obtained from resolved direct numerical simulations. Our new approach achieves high-resolution fidelity while reducing computational costs, effectively bridging the physical scale gap and enabling multi-scale simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 A B-mode polarization signal in the cosmic microwave background is widely regarded as smoking gun evidence for gravitational waves produced during inflation. Here we demonstrate that tensor perturbations from a cosmological phase transition in the post-inflationary universe can nearly mimic the characteristic shape and power of inflationary predictions across a range of observable angular scales. Although phase transitions arise from subhorizon physics, they nevertheless exhibit a white noise power spectrum on superhorizon scales. Thus, while B-mode power is suppressed on these large scales, it is not necessarily negligible. For viable phase transition parameters, the maximal B-mode amplitude at multipole moments around the recombination peak can be comparable to nearly all single-field inflationary predictions that can be tested with current and future experiments. This approximate degeneracy can be broken if a signal is measured at different angular scales, since the inflationary power spectrum is nearly scale invariant while the phase transition predicts a distinct suppression of power on large scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of the repeating fast radio burst source FRB 20240209A using the CHIME/FRB telescope. We have detected 22 bursts from this repeater between February and July 2024, six of which were also recorded at the Outrigger station KKO. The 66-km long CHIME-KKO baseline can provide single-pulse FRB localizations along one dimension with $2^{\prime\prime}$ accuracy. The high declination of $\sim$86 degrees for this repeater allowed its detection with a rotating range of baseline vectors, enabling the combined localization region size to be constrained to $1^{\prime\prime}\times2^{\prime\prime}$. We present deep Gemini observations that, combined with the FRB localization, enabled a robust association of FRB 20240209A to the outskirts of a luminous galaxy (P(O|x) = 0.99; $L \approx 5.3 \times 10^{10}\,L_{\odot}$). FRB 20240209A has a projected physical offset of $40 \pm 5$ kpc from the center of its host galaxy, making it the FRB with the largest host galaxy offset to date. When normalized by the host galaxy size, the offset of FRB 20240209A is comparable to that of FRB 20200120E, the only FRB source known to originate in a globular cluster. We consider several explanations for the large offset, including a progenitor that was kicked from the host galaxy or in situ formation in a low-luminosity satellite galaxy of the putative host, but find the most plausible scenario to be a globular cluster origin. This, coupled with the quiescent, elliptical nature of the host as demonstrated in our companion paper, provide strong evidence for a delayed formation channel for the progenitor of the FRB source.

          Orthonormal Bases for Reconstructing Pairwise Interpulsar Correlations in Pulsar Timing Arrays

 - **Abstract**
 For pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), the telltale signature of an isotropic stochastic background of gravitational waves is a pattern of pairwise interpulsar timing correlations approximately following the Hellings & Downs (HD) curve. Certain systematic errors and new physics processes also lead to interpulsar correlations with different patterns that can be distinguished from the HD curve to varied degrees. As evidence of HD correlations in PTA data mounts in coming years, it is important to develop principled strategies for flexibly and optimally reconstructing the pattern of interpulsar timing correlations, both to test how well the correlations track the HD pattern and to possibly detect additional effects, systematic or otherwise. To this end, we develop orthonormal basis functions that fully capture HD correlations and eliminate covariances between the HD curve and any additional correlated structure. We do this analytically and in a data-adaptive way informed by "optimal statistic" analysis techniques widely used by PTA groups. These bases are adaptive in that they will vary from PTA to PTA and from data release to data release as new pulsars of varied timing quality and baseline are added to arrays, as instrumentation advances, and as observations accrue. We discuss how the techniques we introduce can be extended to future multi-signal searches by PTAs and to robust assessment of HD detection significance.

          The SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Q-band Follow-up. I. -Carbon-Chain Chemistry of Intermediate-Mass Protostars-

 - **Abstract**
 Evidence for similar chemical characteristics around low- and high-mass protostars has been found: in particular, a variety of carbon-chain species and complex organic molecules (COMs) are formed around them. On the other hand, the chemical compositions around intermediate-mass (IM; $2 M_{\odot} < m_* <8 M_{\odot}$) protostars have not been studied with large samples. In particular, it is unclear the extent to which carbon-chain species are formed around them. We aim to obtain the chemical compositions, particularly focusing on carbon-chain species, towards a sample of IM protostars. We have conducted Q-band (31.5-50 GHz) line survey observations towards eleven mainly intermediate-mass protostars with the Yebes 40 m radio telescope. The target protostars were selected from a sub-sample of the source list of the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation project. Nine carbon-chain species (HC$_3$N, HC$_5$N, C$_3$H, C$_4$H, $linear-$H$_2$CCC, $cyclic-$C$_3$H$_2$, CCS, C$_3$S, and CH$_3$CCH), three COMs (CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CHO, and CH$_3$CN), H$_2$CCO, HNCO, and four simple sulfur (S)-bearing species ($^{13}$CS, C$^{34}$S, HCS$^+$, H$_2$CS) have been detected. The rotational temperatures of HC$_5$N are derived to be $\sim20-30$ K in three IM protostars and they are very similar compared to those around low- and high-mass protostars. These results indicate that carbon-chain molecules are formed in lukewarm ($\sim20-30$ K) gas around the IM protostars by the Warm Carbon-Chain Chemistry (WCCC) process. Carbon-chain formation occurs ubiquitously in the warm gas around protostars across a wide range of stellar masses. Carbon-chain molecules and COMs coexist around most of the target IM protostars, which is similar to the situation in low- and high-mass protostars. The chemical characteristics around protostars are common in the low-, intermediate- and high-mass regimes.

          Diversities and similarities exhibited by multi-planetary systems and their architectures: I. Orbital spacings

 - **Abstract**
 The rich diversity of multi-planetary systems and their architectures is greatly contrasted by the uniformity exhibited within many of these systems. Previous studies have shown that compact Kepler systems tend to exhibit a peas-in-a-pod architecture: Planets in the same system tend to have similar sizes and masses and be regularly spaced in orbits with low eccentricities and mutual inclinations. This work extends on previous research and examines a larger and more diverse sample comprising all the systems with a minimum of three confirmed planets, resulting in 282 systems and 991 planets. We investigated the system architectures, focusing on the orbital spacings between adjacent planets as well as their relationships with the planets' sizes and masses. We also quantified the similarities of the sizes, masses, and spacings of planets within each system, conducting both intra- and inter-system analyses. Our results corroborate previous research showing that planets orbiting the same star tend to be regularly spaced and that pairs of adjacent planets with radii<1 R_Earth predominantly have orbital period ratios (PRs)<2. In contrast to other studies, we identified a significant similarity of adjacent orbital spacings not only at PRs<4 but also at 1.17<PRs<2662. For the systems with transiting planets, we additionally found that the reported correlation between the PRs and the sizes of adjacent planets disappears when planet pairs with R<1 R_Earth are excluded. Furthermore, we examined the data for possible correlations between the intra-system dispersions of orbital spacings and those of the planetary radii and masses. Our findings indicate that these dispersions are uncorrelated for the systems in which all planet pairs have PRs<6, and even for the compact systems where all PRs<2. Notably, planets in the same system can be similarly spaced even if they do not have similar masses or sizes.

          Projections of Earth's Technosphere: Luminosity and Mass as Limits to Growth

 - **Abstract**
 Earth remains the only known example of a planet with technology, and future projections of Earth's trajectory provide a basis and motivation for approaching the search for extraterrestrial technospheres. Conventional approaches toward projecting Earth's technosphere include applications of the Kardashev scale, which suggest the possibility that energy-intensive civilizations may expand to harness the entire energy output available to their planet, host star, or even the entire galaxy. In this study, we argue that the Kardashev scale is better understood as a "luminosity limit" that describes the maximum capacity for a civilization to harvest luminous stellar energy across a given spatial domain, and we note that thermodynamic efficiency will always keep a luminosity-limited technosphere from actually reaching this theoretical limit. We suggest the possibility that an advanced technosphere might evolve beyond this luminosity limit to draw its energy directly from harvesting stellar mass, and we also discuss possible trajectories that could exist between Earth today and such hypothetical "stellivores." We develop a framework to describe trajectories for long-lived technospheres that optimize their growth strategies between exploration and exploitation, unlike Earth today. We note that analyses of compact accreting stars could provide ways to test the stellivore hypothesis, and we more broadly suggest an expansion of technosignature search strategies beyond those that reside exactly at the luminosity limit.

          Imaging of the Vega Debris System using JWST/MIRI

 - **Abstract**
 We present images of the Vega planetary debris disk obtained at 15.5, 23, and 25.5 microns with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on JWST. The debris system is remarkably symmetric and smooth, and centered accurately on the star. There is a broad Kuiper-belt-analog ring at 80 to 170 au that coincides with the planetesimal belt detected with ALMA at 1.34 mm. The interior of the broad belt is filled with warm debris that shines most efficiently at mid-infrared along with a shallow flux dip/gap at 60 au from the star. These qualitative characteristics argue against any Saturn-mass planets orbiting the star outside of about 10 au assuming the unseen planet would be embedded in the very broad planetesimal disk from a few to hundred au. We find that the distribution of dust detected interior to the broad outer belt is consistent with grains being dragged inward by the Poynting-Robertson effect. Tighter constraints can be derived for planets in specific locations, for example any planet shepherding the inner edge of the outer belt is likely to be less than 6 Earth masses. The disk surface brightness profile along with the available infrared photometry suggest a disk inner edge near 3-5 au, disconnected from the sub-au region that gives rise to the hot near-infrared excess. The gap between the hot, sub-au zone and the inner edge of the warm debris might be shepherded by a modest mass, Neptune-size planet.

          Origin of line broadening in fading granule: influence of small-scale turbulence

 - **Abstract**
 In the quiet region of the solar photosphere, turbulent convective motions of the granular flows naturally drive the subgranular-scale flows. However, evaluating such small-scale velocities is challenging because of the limited instrumental resolution. Our previous study, Ishikawa et al. (2020), found line broadening events during fading process of granules; however, their physical mechanism has remained unclear. In the present study, we observed the fading granules with the Hinode-SOT/SP and performed spectral line inversions. Moreover, we investigated broadening events of synthesized spectra in fading granules reproduced by the MURaM simulation. Our results demonstrated that the small-scale turbulent motions are excited in the fading process and such turbulent flows contribute to line broadening. The spectral line widths can be potential tracers of the photospheric turbulent flows.

 - **Abstract**
 The ongoing discovery of exoplanets has sparked significant interest in finding suitable worlds that could potentially support life. Stellar ultraviolet (UV; 100-3000 Å) radiation may play a crucial role in determining the habitability of their planets. In this paper, we conducted a detailed analysis of the UV photometry of over 2700 host stars with confirmed planets, using observational data from the GALEX and Swift UVOT missions. We performed aperture photometry on single-exposure images, and provided photometric catalogs that can be used to explore a wide range of scientific questions, such as stellar UV activity and planet habitability. By calculating the circumstellar habitable zone (CHZ) and UV habitable zone (UHZ), we found that fewer than 100 exoplanets fall within both of these zones, with the majority being gas giants. We also examined stellar activity based on their far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) emissions. We found the FUV$-$NUV color more effectively represents stellar activity compared to the $R^{\prime}_{\rm FUV}$ and $R^{\prime}_{\rm NUV}$ indices. The Sun's low FUV emission and moderate NUV emission highlight its uniqueness among (solar-like) stars.

 - **Abstract**
 In October 2024, The object BL Lac experienced a brightest flaring event in gamma-ray ($>$100 MeV) with a historical $\gamma$-ray flux of $\sim$10$^{-5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Soon after the event was followed across the waveband and in X-ray (0.3-10 keV) it was also found to be flaring with the maximum flux achieved during this event as 8.30$\times$10$^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The high gamma-ray significance enables us to probe the shortest time scale variability possible and for that, we produced the orbital binned light curve, 5 minutes binned light curve, and the 2 minutes binned light curve. A clear variation is seen in the 5-minute light curve and is fitted with the sum of exponentials to derive the rise and decay time scale which ranges between 3 to 12 minutes. The fastest variability time is also estimated to be an order of 1 minute from 2 minute. The estimated size of the emission region is very small (10$^{13}$ cm) compared to the size of the black hole event horizon. The location of the emission region is estimated to be very close to the supermassive black hole (10$^{14}$ cm) and much inside the BLR (0.1 pc). We discussed the possible way to explain this fast-flux variability in BL Lac.

          Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation on the Lattice: Backreaction and Nonlinear Effects

 - **Abstract**
 Violating the slow-roll regime during the final stages of inflation can significantly enhance curvature perturbations, a scenario often invoked in models producing primordial black holes and small-scale scalar induced gravitational waves. When perturbations are enhanced, one approaches the regime in which tree-level computations are insufficient, and nonlinear corrections may become relevant. In this work, we conduct lattice simulations of ultra-slow-roll (USR) dynamics to investigate the significance of nonlinear effects, both in terms of backreaction on the background and in the evolution of perturbations. Our systematic study of various USR potentials reveals that nonlinear corrections are significant when the tree-level curvature power spectrum peaks at $\mathcal{P}^{\rm max}_{\zeta} = {\cal O}(10^{-3})-{\cal O}(10^{-2})$, with 5%$-$10% corrections. Larger enhancements yield even greater differences. We establish a universal relation between simulation and tree-level quantities $\dot\phi = \dot\phi_{\rm tree}\left(1+\sqrt{\mathcal{P}^{\rm max}_{\zeta,\rm tree}}\right)$ at the end of the USR phase, which is valid in all cases we consider. Additionally, we explore how nonlinear interactions during the USR phase affect the clustering and non-Gaussianity of scalar fluctuations, crucial for understanding the phenomenological consequences of USR, such as scalar-induced gravitational waves and primordial black holes. Our findings demonstrate the necessity of going beyond leading order perturbation theory results, through higher-order or non-perturbative computations, to make robust predictions for inflation models exhibiting a USR phase.

 - **Abstract**
 Deneb, the prototype alpha Cygni variable, is a blue-white supergiant that shows irregular variability with quasi-period around 12 days in brightness and radial velocity. Abt et al. (2023) found that larger amplitude 12-day variations appear to resume abruptly and at an arbitrary phase and damp out after several cycles, with an interval of around 70 days between these resumptions. Here we make use of an 8.6-year photometric data set for Deneb from the Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI) to better characterize this behavior. We find that the interval between pulsation resumptions is not exact, with the most common intervals between 100 and 120 days. Sometimes one or more intervals are skipped. We also examine AAVSO and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curves for alpha Cyg variables Rigel, Saiph, and Alnilam in Orion, Aludra in Canis Major, and 6 Cas to compare with the behavior of alpha Cyg. Except for 6 Cas, the time series are too short, or the observations too infrequent to draw any conclusions about similarities between the behavior of these stars and alpha Cyg. We also summarize results of evolution and pulsation modeling for Deneb and alpha Cyg variables from the literature. The alpha Cyg variables may not be a homogenous group with a common mechanism for their variability. It has not been determined whether they are on the first crossing of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram toward the red supergiant phase or are on their second crossing after having been red supergiants. Future plans include examining BRITE Constellation data for Deneb, processing SMEI data for other bright alpha Cyg variables, and comparing 6 Cas light curves from AAVSO and TESS data taken concurrently.

 - **Abstract**
 Interplanetary shocks are fundamental constituents of the heliosphere, where they form as a result of solar activity. We use previously unavailable measurements of interplanetary shocks in the inner heliosphere provided by Solar Orbiter, and present a survey of the first 100 shocks observed in situ at different heliocentric distances during the rising phase of solar cycle 25. The fundamental shock parameters (shock normals, shock normal angles, shock speeds, compression ratios, Mach numbers) have been estimated and studied as a function of heliocentric distance, revealing a rich scenario of configurations. Comparison with large surveys of shocks at 1~au show that shocks in the quasi-parallel regime and with high speed are more commonly observed in the inner heliosphere. The wave environment of the shocks has also been addressed, with about 50\% of the events exhibiting clear shock-induced upstream fluctuations. We characterize energetic particle responses to the passage of IP shocks at different energies, often revealing complex features arising from the interaction between IP shocks and pre-existing fluctuations, including solar wind structures being processed upon shock crossing. Finally, we give details and guidance on the access use of the present survey, available on the EU-project ``solar energetic particle analysis platform for the inner heliosphere'' (SERPENTINE) website. The algorithm used to identify shocks in large datasets, now publicly available, is also described.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a provisory scattered light detection of the Vega debris disk using deep Hubble Space Telescope coronagraphy (PID 16666). At only 7.7 parsecs, Vega is immensely important in debris disk studies both for its prominence and also because it allows the highest physical resolution among all debris systems relative to temperature zones around the star. We employ the STIS coronagraph's widest wedge position and classical Reference Differential Imaging to achieve among the lowest surface brightness sensitivities to date ($\sim 4\,\mu Jy/arcsec^{2}$) at wide separations using 32 orbits in Cycle 29. We detect a halo extending from the inner edge of our effective inner working angle at $10^{\prime\prime}.5$ out to the photon noise floor at $30^{\prime\prime}$ (80 - 230 au). The face-on orientation of the system and the lack of a perfectly color-matched PSF star have provided significant challenges to the reductions, particularly regarding artifacts from the imperfect color matching. However, we find that a halo of small dust grains provides the best explanation for the observed signal. Unlike Fomalhaut (a close twin to Vega in luminosity, distance, and age), there is no clear distinction in scattered light between the parent planetesimal belt observed with ALMA and the extended dust halo. These HST observations complement JWST GTO Cycle 1 observations of the system with NIRCam and MIRI.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed imaging analysis of 260 ks of sub-arcsecond resolution Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS-S) observations of the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 5728. Our study focuses on the bright and diffuse soft X-ray emission within the galaxy's inner ~1 kpc. By comparing the X-ray emission across different energy bands, we identify localized variations in the absorbing column and emission processes. We observe more X-ray absorption in the direction perpendicular to the bicone, which is co-located with an inner warped CO disk in the galaxy. The innermost region, which shows the strongest excess of hard X-ray emission, is spatially coincident with the CO(2-1) emission from ALMA and dusty spirals observed in a Hubble Space Telescope V-H color map. We detect soft extended emission associated with the circumnuclear star-forming ring at ~1 kpc, suggestive of hot gas with kT=0.44 keV. We derive measurements for the hot gas mass, M=7.9x10^5 solar masses, pressure, p=2.0x10^-10 dyne per square cm, and cooling times, t=193.2 Myr. In the vicinity of the star-forming ring, we detect two X-ray point sources with soft X-ray spectra and 0.3-7 keV luminosities L~8x10^38 erg per second. These properties suggest X-ray binaries.

 Despite the first detection of fast radio bursts (FRBs) being as recent as 2007, they have already been proven to be a fantastic tool as a unique cosmological probe. In this chapter, after a brief introduction to FRBs and how they are currently detected, we describe various cosmological questions and how FRB research has both aided previous studies and can continue to do so. Topics include placing constraints on cosmological parameters to understanding the distribution of baryons throughout the Universe. We conclude with some notes on the challenges to be overcome and best enable ongoing and future FRB-based studies of cosmology.

          Measurement of the power spectrum turnover scale from the cross-correlation between CMB lensing and {\sl Quaia}

 - **Abstract**
 We use the projected clustering of quasars in the Gaia-unWISE quasar catalog, Quaia, and its cross-correlation with CMB lensing data from Planck, to measure the large-scale turnover of the matter power spectrum, associated with the size of the horizon at the epoch of matter-radiation equality. The turnover is detected with a significance of between $2.3$ and $3.1\sigma$, depending on the method used to quantify it. From this measurement, the equality scale is determined at the $\sim20\%$ level. Using the turnover scale as a standard ruler alone (discarding information from the large-scale curvature of the power spectrum), in combination with supernova data through an inverse distance ladder approach, we measure the current expansion rate to be $H_0=62.7\pm17.2\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. The addition of information coming from the power spectrum curvature approximately halves the standard ruler uncertainty. Our measurement in combination with calibrated supernovae from Pantheon$+$ and SH0ES constrains the CMB temperature to be $T_{\rm CMB}=3.10^{+0.48}_{-0.36}\,{\rm K}$, independently of CMB data. Alternatively, assuming the value of $T_{\rm CMB}$ from COBE-FIRAS, we can constrain the effective number of relativistic species in the early Universe to be $N_{\rm eff}=3.0^{+5.8}_{-2.9}$.

          Spectral features and variable circular polarisation in the radio emission from the pre-cataclysmic variable QS Vir

 - **Abstract**
 QS Vir is a low-accretion rate cataclysmic variable (CV), or pre-CV, as the M dwarf companion is just filling its Roche lobe. We recently identified radio emission from QS Vir in the Very Large Array Sky Survey, at a flux of ~1 mJy. The origin of radio emission from CVs is not fully understood, with evidence for synchrotron emission from jets and other coherent plasma emission processes, such as electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) or plasma radiation. Our aim is to constrain the radio emission mechanism for QS Vir, through spectroscopic, polarisation, and time variability measurements, all while checking for correlated X-ray variations. We took 3 epochs of new observations with the VLA in S, C, and X bands, with full Stokes polarisation information, complemented by near-simultaneous Swift/XRT X-ray data. Radio spectra are extracted to search for emission features characteristic of coherent plasma emission processes (e.g. high circular polarisation and narrow-band emission). We fit the X-ray spectra with absorbed power-laws, finding no strong X-ray variability. QS Vir showed a nearly flat radio spectrum, with fluxes of 0.4-0.6 mJy in all bands. Swift/XRT showed L_X ~ 5x10^29 erg/s in all observations. We identified strong, variable circular polarisation, ranging from 33+/-3% in S band in the last observation, to <11% in the middle observation in all bands. Linear polarisation was not detected, with upper limits of at most 15%. Intriguingly, the S-band spectra show circularly polarised spectral bumps (width ~0.5 GHz) that rise and decay within <5 minutes. We suggest that the radio emission from QS Vir consists of two components: a relatively constant, low-polarisation flat-spectrum component and a band-limited, rapidly variable, and strongly circularly polarised component. This latter coherent component may be associated with ECME or plasma radiation.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the nature of dark matter in the Universe is an important goal of modern cosmology. A key method for probing this distribution is via weak gravitational lensing mass-mapping - a challenging ill-posed inverse problem where one infers the convergence field from observed shear measurements. Upcoming stage IV surveys, such as those made by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Euclid satellite, will provide a greater quantity and precision of data for lensing analyses, necessitating high-fidelity mass-mapping methods that are computationally efficient and that also provide uncertainties for integration into downstream cosmological analyses. In this work we introduce MMGAN, a novel mass-mapping method based on a regularised conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, which generates approximate posterior samples of the convergence field given shear data. We adopt Wasserstein GANs to improve training stability and apply regularisation techniques to overcome mode collapse, issues that otherwise are particularly acute for conditional GANs. We train and validate our model on a mock COSMOS-style dataset before applying it to true COSMOS survey data. Our approach significantly outperforms the Kaiser-Squires technique and achieves similar reconstruction fidelity as alternative state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. Notably, while alternative approaches for generating samples from a learned posterior are slow (e.g. requiring $\sim$10 GPU minutes per posterior sample), MMGAN can produce a high-quality convergence sample in less than a second.
