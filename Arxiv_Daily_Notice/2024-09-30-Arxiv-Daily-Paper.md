 - **Abstract**
 Direct imaging of exoplanets is particularly challenging due to the high contrast between the planet and the star luminosities, and their small angular separation. In addition to tailored instrumental facilities implementing adaptive optics and coronagraphy, post-processing methods combining several images recorded in pupil tracking mode are needed to attenuate the nuisances corrupting the signals of interest. Most of these post-processing methods build a model of the nuisances from the target observations themselves, resulting in strongly limited detection sensitivity at short angular separations due to the lack of angular diversity. To address this issue, we propose to build the nuisance model from an archive of multiple observations by leveraging supervised deep learning techniques. The proposed approach casts the detection problem as a reconstruction task and captures the structure of the nuisance from two complementary representations of the data. Unlike methods inspired by reference differential imaging, the proposed model is highly non-linear and does not resort to explicit image-to-image similarity measurements and subtractions. The proposed approach also encompasses statistical modeling of learnable spatial features. The latter is beneficial to improve both the detection sensitivity and the robustness against heterogeneous data. We apply the proposed algorithm to several datasets from the VLT/SPHERE instrument, and demonstrate a superior precision-recall trade-off compared to the PACO algorithm. Interestingly, the gain is especially important when the diversity induced by ADI is the most limited, thus supporting the ability of the proposed approach to learn information across multiple observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars and black holes are the after death remnants of massive stars. However, according to the most recent observations, the neutron stars maximum mass is between $2.0-2.5 M_{\odot}$ while black holes of less than 5 $M_{\odot}$ rarely has been observed. The region between the most massive neutron star and the least massive black hole is called the mass gap. If indeed its existence is confirmed by future observations, that indicates a gap in our understanding which seeks for explanation. In addition, the existence of compact objects within the mass gap should also be supported with the help of possible new theoretical scenarios. In this letter, we propose a possible explanation for the existence of compact objects within the mass gap region. Specifically, we propose that the mass gap region could be bridged by the existence of a hybrid compact object, composed of hadronic and self interacting - non annihilating fermionic dark matter, considering that the interaction between these two fluids its only gravitational. Fundamental questions about how these objects form and how they can be detected are also addressed.

          Spatially correlated stellar accretion in the Lupus star forming region: Evidence for ongoing infall from the interstellar medium?

 - **Abstract**
 Growing evidence suggests that protoplanetary discs may be influenced by late stage infall from the interstellar medium (ISM). It remains unclear the degree to which infall shapes disc populations at ages $\gtrsim 1$~Myr. We explore possible spatial correlations between stellar accretion rates in the Lupus star forming region, which would support the hypothesis that infall can regulate stellar accretion. We consider both the `clustered' stars towards the center of Lupus 3, and the `distributed' stars that are more sparsely distributed across the Lupus complex. We take the observed accretion rates in the literature and explore spatial correlations. In particular, we test whether the clustered stars exhibit a radial gradient in normalised accretion rates, and whether the distributed stars have spatially correlated accretion rates. We find statistically significant correlations for both the clustered and distributed samples. The clustered sample exhibits higher accretion rates in the central region, consistent with the expected Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate. Stars that are spatially closer among the distributed population also exhibit more similar accretion rates. These results cannot be explained by the stellar mass distribution for either sample. Age gradients are disfavoured, though not discounted, because normalised disc dust masses are not spatially correlated across the region. Spatially correlated stellar accretion rates within the Lupus star forming region argue in favour of an environmental influence on stellar accretion, possibly combined with internal processes in the inner disc. Refined age measurements and searches for evidence of infalling material is a potential way to further test this finding.

          Disk2Planet: A Robust and Automated Machine Learning Tool for Parameter Inference in Disk-Planet Systems

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce Disk2Planet, a machine learning-based tool to infer key parameters in disk-planet systems from observed protoplanetary disk structures. Disk2Planet takes as input the disk structures in the form of two-dimensional density and velocity maps, and outputs disk and planet properties, that is, the Shakura--Sunyaev viscosity, the disk aspect ratio, the planet--star mass ratio, and the planet's radius and azimuth. We integrate the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA--ES), an evolutionary algorithm tailored for complex optimization problems, and the Protoplanetary Disk Operator Network (PPDONet), a neural network designed to predict solutions of disk--planet interactions. Our tool is fully automated and can retrieve parameters in one system in three minutes on an Nvidia A100 graphics processing unit. We empirically demonstrate that our tool achieves percent-level or higher accuracy, and is able to handle missing data and unknown levels of noise.

          JOYS+ study of solid state $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotope ratios in protostellar envelopes: Observations of CO and CO$_2$ ice with JWST

 - **Abstract**
 The carbon isotope ratio is a powerful tool for studying the evolution of stellar systems. Recent detections of CO isotopologues in disks and exoplanet atmospheres pointed towards significant fractionation in these systems. In order to understand the evolution of this quantity, it is crucial to trace the isotope abundance from stellar nurseries to planetary systems. During the protostellar stage the multiple vibrational modes of CO$_2$ and CO ice provide a unique opportunity to examine the carbon isotope ratio in the solid state. Now with the sensitivity of the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope}, these absorption features have become accessible at high S/N in Solar-mass systems. We quantify the $^{12}$CO$_2$/$^{13}$CO$_2$ and the $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO isotope ratios in 17 class 0/I low mass protostars from the $^{12}$CO$_2$ combination modes (2.70 ${\mu}$m and 2.77 ${\mu}$m), the $^{12}$CO$_2$ stretching mode (4.27 ${\mu}$m), the $^{13}$CO$_2$ stretching mode (4.39 ${\mu}$m), the $^{12}$CO$_2$ bending mode (15.2 ${\mu}$m), the $^{12}$CO stretching mode (4.67 ${\mu}$m) and the $^{13}$CO stretching mode (4.78 ${\mu}$m) using JWST observations. We also report a detection of the $^{12}$CO overtone mode at 2.35 ${\mu}$m. The $^{12}$CO$_2$/$^{13}$CO$_2$ ratios are in agreement and we find mean ratios of 85 $\pm$ 23, 76 $\pm$ 12 and 97 $\pm$ 17 for the 2.70 ${\mu}$m, 4.27 ${\mu}$m and the 15.2 ${\mu}$m bands, respectively. The main source of uncertainty stem from the error on the band strengths. The $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratios derived from the 4.67 ${\mu}$m bands are consistent, albeit elevated with respect to the $^{12}$CO$_2$/$^{13}$CO$_2$ ratios and we find a mean ratio of 165 $\pm$ 52. These findings indicate that ices leave the pre-stellar stage with elevated carbon isotope ratios relative to the interstellar medium and that fractionation becomes significant during the later stages.

          The Magellanic Clouds are very rare in the IllustrisTNG simulations

 - **Abstract**
 The Large and Small Magellanic Cloud (LMC and SMC) form the closest interacting galactic system to the Milky Way, therewith providing a laboratory to test cosmological models in the local Universe. We quantify the likelihood for the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) to be observed within the $\Lambda$CDM model using hydrodynamical simulations of the IllustrisTNG project. The orbits of the MCs are constrained by proper motion measurements taken by the $Hubble~Space~Telescope$ and $Gaia$. The MCs have a mutual separation of $d_{\mathrm{MCs}}~=~24.5\,\mathrm{kpc}$ and a relative velocity of $v_{\mathrm{MCs}}~=~90.8\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, implying a phase-space density of $f_{\mathrm{MCs,obs}}~\equiv~(d_{\mathrm{MCs}} \cdot v_{\mathrm{MCs}})^{-3}~=~9.10\times10^{-11}\,\mathrm{km^{-3}\,s^{3}\,kpc^{-3}}$. We select analogues to the MCs based on their stellar masses and distances in MW-like halos. None of the selected LMC analogues have a higher total mass and lower Galactocentric distance than the LMC, resulting in $>3.75\sigma$ tension. We also find that the $f_{\mathrm{MCs}}$ distribution in the highest resolution TNG50 simulation is in $3.95\sigma$ tension with observations. Thus, a hierarchical clustering of two massive satellites like the MCs in a narrow phase-space volume is unlikely in $\Lambda$CDM, presumably because of short merger timescales due to dynamical friction between the overlapping dark matter halos. We show that group infall led by an LMC analogue cannot populate the Galactic disc of satellites (DoS), implying that the DoS and the MCs formed in physically unrelated ways in $\Lambda$CDM. Since the $20^\circ$ alignment of the LMC and DoS orbital poles has a likelihood of $P=0.030$ ($2.17\sigma$), adding this $\chi^2$ to that of $f_{\mathrm{MCs}}$ gives a combined likelihood of $P = 3.90\times10^{-5}$ ($4.11\sigma$).

 - **Abstract**
 Particle interactions are key elements of many dynamical systems. In the context of systems described by a Boltzmann equation, such interactions may be described by a collision integral, a multidimensional integral over the momentum-phase space of the interaction. This integral is often simplified by assuming isotropic particle distributions; however, such an assumption places constraints on the dynamics of the system. This paper presents computational forms of the collision integral for relativistic, binary interactions at three levels of anisotropy, including a novel form in the isotropic case. All these forms are split into two parts, an absorption and an emission spectrum, which may be pre-calculated via numerical integration for simulation purposes. We demonstrate the use of these forms by comparison with the analytically integrated, isotropic emission spectrum of electron-positron annihilation, which are shown to agree to numerical precision. The emission spectrum is then further extended to axisymmetric particle distributions, where two-dimensional spectral maps can be generated to provide new insight.

 - **Abstract**
 Contact binaries challenge contemporary stellar astrophysics with respect to their incidence, structure and evolution. We explore these issues through a detailed study of two bright examples: S Ant and Eps CrA, that permit high-resolution spectroscopy at a relatively good S/N ratio. The availability of high-quality photometry, including data from the TESS satellite as well as Gaia parallaxes, allows us to apply the Russell paradigm to produce reliable up-to-date information on the physical properties of these binaries. As a result, models of their interactive evolution, such as the thermal relaxation oscillator scenario, can be examined. Mass transfer between the components is clearly evidenced, but the variability of the O'Connell effect over relatively short time scales points to irregularities in the mass transfer or accretion processes. Our findings indicate that S Ant may evolve into an R CMa type Algol, while the low mass ratio of Eps CrA suggests a likely merger of its components in the not-too-distant future.

 - **Abstract**
 Some accreting binary systems containing a white dwarf (such as classical novae or persistent supersoft sources) are seen to emit low energy X-rays with temperatures of ~10^6 K and luminosities exceeding 10^35 erg/s. These X-rays are thought to originate from nuclear burning on the white dwarf surface, either caused by a thermonuclear runaway (classical novae) or a high mass accretion rate that sustains steady nuclear burning (persistent sources). The discovery of transient supersoft X-rays from ASASSN-16oh challenged these ideas, as no signatures of nuclear fusion were detected, and the origin of these X-rays remains controversial. It was unclear whether this star was one of a kind or representative of a larger, as yet undiscovered, group. Here we present the discovery of 29 stars located in the direction of the Magellanic Clouds exhibiting long-duration, symmetrical optical outbursts similar to that seen in ASASSN-16oh. We observed one of these objects during an optical outburst and found it to be emitting transient supersoft X-rays, while no signatures of mass ejection (indicative of a classical nova eruption) were detected. We therefore propose that these objects form a homogeneous group of transient supersoft X-ray sources, which we dub `millinovae' because their optical luminosities are approximately a thousand times fainter than those of ordinary classical novae.

          The Multiple Extended Tidal Tails of NGC 288

 - **Abstract**
 Using photometry and proper motions from Pan-STARRS, DECaLS, and Gaia DR3, we detect a ~35 to 70 degree-long trailing stellar debris stream associated with the globular cluster NGC 288. We also detect a broad, ~40 to 80 degree-long leading tail that appears to be composed of at least two narrower, spatially offset, and kinematically distinct streams. Stream modeling predicts a very similar broad composite of streams and suggests that these narrower components are each made up of one or more generations of tidal tails, each formed during different orbits over the past few gigayears. The trajectory of the trailing tail is not well matched by a model stream evolved in a static Galactic potential, but is reasonably well matched by a stream modeled in a potential that incorporates a massive, infalling Large Magellanic Cloud. Tables of the most highly ranked stream star candidates are provided for ongoing and future spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomy is entering an unprecedented era of data collection. Upcoming large surveys will gather more data than ever before, generated at rates requiring real-time decision making. Looking ahead, it is inevitable that astronomers will need to rely more heavily on automated processes. Indeed, some instances have already arisen wherein the majority of the inspection process is automated. Visual discovery, performed traditionally by humans, is one key area where automation is now being integrated rapidly. Visual discovery comprises two aspects: (1) visual inspection, the skill associated with examining an image to identify areas or objects of interest; and (2) visual interpretation, the knowledge associated with the classification of the objects or features. Both skills and knowledge are vital for humans to perform visual discovery, however, there appears to have been limited investigation into how the skill of visual inspection in astronomy is acquired. We report on a survey of 70 professional observational astronomers, at various career stages and from different geographical regions. We found that between 63% and 73% of the astronomers surveyed had received formal and$/$or informal training in visual inspection of images, although formal training (21%) was less common than informal training (60%). Surprisingly, out of the 37% who did not recall having received training in visual inspection, 29% (20 astronomers) indicated that they provided training to others. This suggests the emergence of `expertise without precedent' where a first expert in the field provides a new way of achieving a task. These results, paired with a set of three pilot interviews, present a touchstone against which the training of future observational astronomers can be compared.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitationally strongly lensed quasars (SL-QSO) offer invaluable insights into cosmological and astrophysical phenomena. With the data from ongoing and next-generation surveys, thousands of SL-QSO systems can be discovered expectedly, leading to unprecedented opportunities. However, the challenge lies in identifying SL-QSO from enormous datasets with high recall and purity in an automated and efficient manner. Hence, we developed a program based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for finding SL-QSO from large-scale surveys and applied it to the Kilo-degree Survey Data Release 5 (KiDS DR5). Our approach involves three key stages: firstly, we pre-selected ten million bright objects (with $r$-band $\tt{MAG\_AUTO} < 22$), excluding stars from the dataset; secondly, we established realistic training and test sets to train and fine-tune the CNN, resulting in the identification of 4195 machine candidates, and the false positive rate (FPR) of $\sim$1/2000 and recall of 0.8125 evaluated by using the real test set containing 16 confirmed lensed quasars; thirdly, human inspections were performed for further selections, and then 272 SL-QSO candidates were eventually found in total, including 16 high-score, 118 median-score, and 138 lower-score candidates, separately. Removing the systems already confirmed or identified in other papers, we end up with 229 SL-QSO candidates, including 7 high-score, 95 median-score, and 127 lower-score candidates, and the corresponding catalog is publicly available online.

          Black hole ring images from PSF structures

 - **Abstract**
 Two critical aspects of radio interferometric imaging analysis are data calibration and deconvolution of the point spread function (PSF) structure. Both of these are particularly important for high-frequency observations using a VLBI network consisting of a small number of stations, such as those conducted by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) has presented images of ring-shaped black holes from observations of M 87 (d = 42 +- 3 muas)(EHTC2019a) and the Galactic Center (d = 51.8 +- 2.3 muas)(EHTC2022a). The ring structures seen in the EHTC images are consistent with the estimated shadow diameter of the black hole based on its mass and distance. However, these black hole ring sizes are also the same with the typical up and down spacings (e.g., the intervals between the main beam and nearby 1st-sidelobes) seen in the point spread function (PSF; dirty beam) for each observation. These facts suggest that the EHTC ring structures are artifacts derived from the shape of the PSFs rather than the intrinsic structure of the SMBHs in M 87 and the Galactic Center. The EHTC utilizes novel imaging techniques in addition to the standard CLEAN algorithm. The CLEAN method was designed for PSF shape deconvolution in mind, yet in practice, it may not always be able to completely remove the PSF shape. In the imaging analysis of data from interferometers with a small number of antennas like the EHT, it is crucial to assess the PSF shape and compare it with the imaging results. The novel imaging methods employed by the EHTC have not yet been fully evaluated for PSF deconvolution performance, and it is highly recommended that their performance in this regard be thoroughly examined. It is also important to investigate the data calibration capability, i.e., the ability to separate error noise from the observed data.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the discovery and spectroscopic confirmation of TOI-2458 b, a transiting mini-Neptune around an F-type star leaving the main-sequence with a mass of $M_\star=1.05 \pm 0.03$ M$_{\odot}$, a radius of $R_\star=1.31 \pm 0.03$ R$_{\odot}$, an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}=6005\pm50$ K, and a metallicity of $-0.10\pm0.05$ dex. By combining TESS photometry with high-resolution spectra acquired with the HARPS spectrograph, we found that the transiting planet has an orbital period of $\sim$3.74 days, a mass of $M_p=13.31\pm0.99$ M$_{\oplus}$ and a radius of $R_p=2.83\pm0.20$ R$_{\oplus}$. The host star TOI-2458 shows a short activity cycle of $\sim$54 days revealed in the HARPS S-index time series. We took the opportunity to investigate other F stars showing activity cycle periods comparable to that of TOI-2458 and found that they have shorter rotation periods than would be expected based on the gyrochronology predictions. In addition, we determined TOI-2458's stellar inclination angle to be $i_\star\,=\,10.6_{-10.6}^{+13.3}$ degrees. We discuss that both phenomena (fast stellar rotation and planet orbit inclination) could be explained by in situ formation of a hot Jupiter interior to TOI-2458 b. It is plausible that this hot Jupiter was recently engulfed by the star. Analysis of HARPS spectra has identified the presence of another planet with a period of $P\,=\,16.55\pm0.06$ days and a minimum mass of $M_p \sin i=10.22\pm1.90$ M$_{\oplus}$.

          A unified scenario to understand the long-term spectral variation for the bright Fermi-LAT blazars

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we analyze the $\sim 16$ yr Fermi-LAT data of a sample of blazars consisting of 29 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and 27 BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), exhibiting their spectral behavior based on the monthly binned photon index. We find that almost all of the FSRQs ($\sim 90\%$) display a harder-when-brighter (HWB) trend, while the majority of BL Lacs ($\sim 63\%$) exhibit a softer-when-brighter (SWB) trend. The BL Lacs with prominent HWB behavior mainly are low synchrotron peak (LSP, $\nu_p^s<10^{14}$ Hz) targets. Additionally, we observe that, as the variability index increases, the variation trend changes from the SWB to the HWB continuously. We name such correlation the gamma-ray variability sequence of blazars. This sequence could be explained by the multi-zone (two-component) scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 Circumstellar material (CSM) produced by mass loss from massive stars ($\gtrsim10 M_{\odot}$) through strong stellar winds or binary stripping provides rich information for understanding progenitors of core-collapse supernova remnants. In this paper we present a grating spectroscopy of a Galactic SNR G292.0+1.8, which is claimed to be a Type Ib/c remnant in a binary system according to recent studies. If G292.0+1.8 was experienced a strong mass-loss via binary interactions before its explosion, an oxygen-rich material produced in the He-burning layer is expected to be observed in the central belt-like structure formed by shock-heated CSM. Using the Reflection Grating Spectrometer onboard XMM-Newton, we detect N VII Ly$\alpha$ line (0.50 keV) for the first time in G292.0+1.8 and find that the abundance ratio of nitrogen to oxygen is significantly lower (N/O$=0.5\pm0.1$) than the solar value. This low N/O suggests that the progenitor of experienced strong mass-loss and ended up to a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star exposing the He-burning layer at the pre-supernova. Comparing our result and the evolution models of single stars and binaries, we conclude that the progenitor of G292.0+1.8 experienced strong mass-loss enough to occur a Type Ib/c supernova. Our finding is another crucial piece of evidence for a stripped-envelope supernova such as Type Ib/c as the origin of G292.0+1.8.

 - **Abstract**
 Collisions between aggregates with different histories and compositions are expected to be commonplace in dynamically active protoplanetary discs. Nonetheless, relatively little is known about how collisions themselves may contribute to the resulting mixing of material. Here we use state-of-the-art granular dynamics simulations to investigate mixing between target/projectile material in a variety of individual aggregate-aggregate collisions, and use the results to discuss the efficiency of collisional mixing in protoplanetary environments. We consider sticking collisions (up to 10-20 m/s for our set-up) and disruptive collisions (40 m/s) of BPCA and BCCA clusters, and quantify mixing in the resulting fragments on both individual fragment and sub-aggregate levels. We find that the mass fraction of material that can be considered to be `well-mixed' (i.e., locally made up of a mix of target and projectile material) to be limited, typically between 3-6% for compact BPCA precursors, and increasing to 20-30% for more porous BCCA clusters. The larger fragments produced in disruptive collisions are equally heterogeneous, suggesting aggregate-aggregate collisions are a relatively inefficient way of mixing material with different origins on small scales.

 Recent studies show that non-radial structures arising from massive star shell convection play an important role in shaping core-collapse supernova explosions. During the collapse phase, convective vortices generate acoustic waves that interact with the supernova shock. This amplifies turbulence in the post-shock region, contributing to explosion. We study how various physical parameters influence the evolution of these convective vortices during stellar collapse using simplified simulations. We model the collapsing star with a transonic Bondi flow and represent convection as solenoidal velocity perturbations. Our results are consistent with previous studies, demonstrating that the peak perturbation amplitude scales linearly with the pre-collapse convective Mach number and inversely with the angular wavenumber of convection. While the shell radius and width primarily determine the timescale of accretion, they have little impact on the peak perturbation amplitudes. Finally, we show that when the convective Mach number is below approximately 0.2, the dynamics remain within the linear regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) waves commonly exhibit as single wavefront and are believed to be caused by coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Utilizing high spatiotemporal resolution imaging observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we present two sequentially generated wave trains originating from the same active region: a narrow quasiperiodic fast-propagating (QFP) wave train that propagates along the coronal loop system above the jet and a broad QFP wave train that travels along the solar surface beneath the jet. The measurements indicate that the narrow QFP wave train and the accompanying flare's quasiperiodic pulsations (QPPs) have nearly identical onsets and periods. This result suggests that the accompanying flare process excites the observed narrow QFP wave train. However, the broad QFP wave train starts approximately 2 minutes before the QPPs of the flare, but consistent with the interaction between the unwinding jet and the solar surface. Moreover, we find that the \zx{period of the broad QFP wave train, approximately 130\,s, closely matches that of the unwinding jet}. This period is significantly longer than the 30\,s period of the accompanying flare's QPPs. Based on these findings, we propose that the intermittent energy release of the accompanying flare excited the narrow QFP wave train confined propagating in the coronal loop system. The unwinding jet, rather than the intermittent energy release in the accompanying flare, triggered the broad QFP wave train propagating along the solar surface.

 - **Abstract**
 The prompt phase X- and $\gamma$-ray light curves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) exhibit erratic and complex behaviour, often with multiple pulses. The temporal shape of individual pulses is often modelled as 'fast rise exponential decay' (FRED). Here, we introduce a novel fitting function to quantify pulse asymmetry. We conduct a light curve and a time-resolved spectral analysis on 61 pulses from 22 GRBs detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. Contrary to previous claims, we find that only $\sim 50\%$ of pulse lightcurves in our sample show a FRED shape, while about $25\%$ have a symmetric lightcurve, and the other $25\%$ have a mixed shape. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a clear trend: in multi-pulse bursts, the initial pulse tends to exhibit the most symmetric light curve, while subsequent pulses become increasingly asymmetric, adopting a more FRED-like shape. Additionally, we correlate the temporal and spectral shapes of the pulses. By fitting the spectra with the classical "Band" function, we find a moderate positive Spearman correlation index of 0.23 between pulse asymmetry and the low-energy spectral index $\alpha_{\max}$ (the maximum value across all time bins covering an individual pulse). Thus, during GRB light curves, the pulses tend to get more asymmetric and spectrally softer with time. We interpret this as a transition in the dominant emission mechanism from photospheric (symmetric-like and hard) to non-thermal emission above the photosphere and show that this interpretation aligns with a GRB jet Lorentz factor of the order of a few 10s in many cases.

 Recent observational data seem to show a $\gtrsim 3\sigma$ evidence for an evolving dark energy (DE) against the cosmological constant, so the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In this paper, we perform the search for the primordial gravitational waves with the potential pre-recombination solutions to the Hubble tension, using recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation measurements combined with BICEP/Keck cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarization, Planck CMB and Pantheon supernova data, which reveal that the low bound of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is $> 1.5\sigma$ non-zero with the bestfit $r_{0.05}\sim 0.01$ and the scalar spectral index $n_s= 1$ (both $|r_{0.05}-0.01|$ and $|n_s-1|\sim {\cal O} (0.001)$). In particular, we observe the unnoticed impact of CMB B-mode polarization data for constraining the nature of DE, which together with early dark energy solutions to the Hubble tension is calling for the return of post-recombination $\Lambda$CDM.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological perturbations in warm inflation are conventionally described by an EFT. It consists of the inflaton field coupled to a radiation fluid and applies to energy scales of order Hubble $H$ and inflaton decay width $\gamma$, but well below temperature $T$. This EFT lacks a proper treatment of inflatons produced with energy $\sim T$. While the direct contribution of these ``UV inflatons'' to the super-horizon curvature perturbations is subdominant because of the cosmological redshift, for $\gamma \sim H$, their indirect contribution is potentially important -- by their effect on the equation of state, by being exchanged as long-lived intermediate states, and by sourcing gravitational waves with their sizable anisotropic stress. To include these effects, we add to the EFT the Boltzmann distribution of the gas of UV inflatons and compute some of the corrections.

 - **Abstract**
 Standard cosmological analysis, which relies on two-point statistics, fails to extract the full information of the data. This limits our ability to constrain with precision cosmological parameters. Thus, recent years have seen a paradigm shift from analytical likelihood-based to simulation-based inference. However, such methods require a large number of costly simulations. We focus on full-field inference, considered the optimal form of inference. Our objective is to benchmark several ways of conducting full-field inference to gain insight into the number of simulations required for each method. We make a distinction between explicit and implicit full-field inference. Moreover, as it is crucial for explicit full-field inference to use a differentiable forward model, we aim to discuss the advantages of having this property for the implicit approach. We use the sbi_lens package which provides a fast and differentiable log-normal forward model. This forward model enables us to compare explicit and implicit full-field inference with and without gradient. The former is achieved by sampling the forward model through the No U-Turns sampler. The latter starts by compressing the data into sufficient statistics and uses the Neural Likelihood Estimation algorithm and the one augmented with gradient. We perform a full-field analysis on LSST Y10 like weak lensing simulated mass maps. We show that explicit and implicit full-field inference yield consistent constraints. Explicit inference requires 630 000 simulations with our particular sampler corresponding to 400 independent samples. Implicit inference requires a maximum of 101 000 simulations split into 100 000 simulations to build sufficient statistics (this number is not fine tuned) and 1 000 simulations to perform inference. Additionally, we show that our way of exploiting the gradients does not significantly help implicit inference.

 - **Abstract**
 The backreaction of a conformal matter sector and its associated conformal anomaly on gravity can be systematically studied using the formalism of the anomaly effective action. This action, defined precisely in flat spacetime within ordinary quantum field theory, can be analyzed perturbatively in terms of external graviton insertions. The expansion coefficients correspond to correlation functions of the stress-energy tensor, which are renormalized through two key counterterms: the square of the Weyl tensor $(C^2)$ and the Gauss-Bonnet term $(E)$. Anomalous conformal Ward identities impose hierarchical constraints on this expansion, revealing that the anomaly's contribution arises from bilinear mixings of the form $R \Box^{-1} E$ and $R \Box^{-1} C^2$, supplemented by local Weyl-invariant terms. These mixings reflect the non-local structure of the anomaly. The precise form of the effective action, however, may vary depending on the regularization scheme used, with potential differences manifesting through additional Weyl-invariant terms. These actions encapsulate the breaking of Weyl invariance in the early universe, with implications that are particularly relevant during the inflationary epoch. For chiral and gravitational anomalies, we demonstrate that the corresponding effective actions exhibit similar structures, influencing the evolution of chiral asymmetries in the early universe plasma.

 - **Abstract**
 The Robert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS) on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) offers multi-object spectroscopy over an 8' field-of-view at resolutions up to 3000. Reduction is typically conducted using RSSMOSPipeline, which performs basic data calibrations, sky subtraction, and wavelength calibration. However, flux calibration of SALT-RSS using spectrophotometric standard star observations is difficult due to variable primary mirror illumination. We describe a novel approach where stars with Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra are included as alignment stars on RSS slitmasks and then used to perform flux calibration of the resulting data. RSS offers multiple settings that can be pieced together to cover the entire optical range, utilizing grating angle dithers to fill chip gaps. We introduce a non-linear reprojection routine that defines an exponential wavelength array spanning 3500-9500 Angstroms with gradually decreasing resolution and then reprojects several individual settings into a single 2D spectrum for each object. Our flux calibration and non-linear reprojection routines are released as part of the Calibration And Reprojection for RSS Pipeline (CARRSSPipeline; this https URL ), that enables the extraction of full-optical-coverage, flux-calibrated, medium-resolution one-dimensional spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 The Neptunian desert and savanna have been recently found to be separated by a ridge, an overdensity of planets in the $\simeq$3-5 days period range. These features are thought to be shaped by dynamical and atmospheric processes. However, their relative roles are not yet well understood. We intend to confirm and characterise the super-Neptune TESS candidate TOI-5005.01, which orbits a moderately bright (V = 11.8) solar-type star (G2 V) with an orbital period of 6.3 days. We confirm TOI-5005 b to be a transiting super-Neptune with a radius of $R_{\rm p}$ = $6.25\pm 0.24$ $\rm R_{\rm \oplus}$ ($R_{\rm p}$ = $0.558\pm 0.021$ $\rm R_{\rm J}$) and a mass of $M_{\rm p}$ = $32.7\pm 5.9$ $\rm M_{\oplus}$ ($M_{\rm p}$ = $0.103\pm 0.018$ $\rm M_{\rm J}$), which corresponds to a mean density of $\rho_{\rm p}$ = $0.74 \pm 0.16$ $\rm g \, cm^{-3}$. Our internal structure modelling indicates that the overall metal mass fraction is well constrained to a value slightly lower than that of Neptune and Uranus ($Z_{\rm planet}$ = $0.76^{+0.04}_{-0.11}$). We also estimated the present-day atmospheric mass-loss rate of TOI-5005 b but found contrasting predictions depending on the choice of photoevaporation model. At a population level, we find statistical evidence ($p$-value = $0.0092^{+0.0184}_{-0.0066}$) that planets in the savanna such as TOI-5005 b tend to show lower densities than planets in the ridge, with a dividing line around 1 $\rm g \, cm^{-3}$, which supports the hypothesis of different evolutionary pathways populating both regimes. TOI-5005 b is located in a key region of the period-radius space to study the transition between the Neptunian ridge and the savanna. It orbits the brightest star of all such planets, which makes it a target of interest for atmospheric and orbital architecture observations that will bring a clearer picture of its overall evolution.
