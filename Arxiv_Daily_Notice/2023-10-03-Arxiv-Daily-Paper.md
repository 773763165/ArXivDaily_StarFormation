#### Recovering the gravitational potential in a rotating frame: Deep  Potential applied to a simulated barred galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar kinematics provide a window into the gravitational field, and therefore into the distribution of all mass, including dark matter. Deep Potential is a method for determining the gravitational potential from a snapshot of stellar positions in phase space, using mathematical tools borrowed from deep learning to model the distribution function and solve the Collisionless Boltzmann Equation. In this work, we extend the Deep Potential method to rotating systems, and then demonstrate that it can accurately recover the gravitational potential, density distribution and pattern speed of a simulated barred disc galaxy, using only a frozen snapshot of the stellar velocities. We demonstrate that we are able to recover the bar pattern speed to within 15% in our simulated galaxy using stars in a 4 kpc sub-volume centered on a Solar-like position, and to within 20% in a 2 kpc sub-volume. In addition, by subtracting the mock "observed" stellar density from the recovered total density, we are able to infer the radial profile of the dark matter density in our simulated galaxy. This extension of Deep Potential is an important step in allowing its application to the Milky Way, which has rotating features, such as a central bar and spiral arms, and may moreover provide a new method of determining the pattern speed of the Milky Way bar.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamical formation channels of gravitational wave (GW) sources typically involve a stage when the compact object binary source interacts with the environment, which may excite its eccentricity, yielding efficient GW emission. For the wide eccentric compact object binaries, the GW emission happens mostly near the pericenter passage, creating a unique, burst-like signature in the waveform. This work examines the possibility of stellar-mass bursting sources in the millihertz band for future LISA detections. Because of their long lifetime ($\sim 10^{7}\rm\, yr$) and promising detectability, the number of millihertz bursting sources can be large in the local universe. For example, based on our estimates, there will be $\sim 3 - 45$ bursting binary black holes in the Milky Way, with $\sim 10^{2} - 10^{4}$ bursts detected during the LISA mission. Moreover, we find that the number of bursting sources strongly depends on their formation history. If certain regions undergo active formation of compact object binaries in the recent few million years, there will be a significantly higher bursting source fraction. Thus, the detection of millihertz GW bursts not only serves as a clue for distinguishing different formation channels, but also helps us understand the star formation history in different regions of the Milky Way.
#### From particles to orbits: precise dark matter density profiles using  dynamical information

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a new method to calculate dark matter halo density profiles from simulations. Each particle is 'smeared' over its orbit to obtain a dynamical profile that is averaged over a dynamical time, in contrast to the traditional approach of binning particles based on their instantaneous positions. The dynamical and binned profiles are in good agreement, with the dynamical approach showing a significant reduction in Poisson noise in the innermost regions. We find that the inner cusps of the new dynamical profiles continue inward all the way to the softening radius, reproducing the central density profile of higher resolution simulations within the 95$\%$ confidence intervals, for haloes in virial equilibrium. Folding in dynamical information thus provides a new approach to improve the precision of dark matter density profiles at small radii, for minimal computational cost. Our technique makes two key assumptions: that the halo is in equilibrium (phase mixed), and that the potential is spherically symmetric. We discuss why the method is successful despite strong violations of spherical symmetry in the centres of haloes, and explore how substructures disturb equilibrium at large radii.
#### AI ensemble for signal detection of higher order gravitational wave  modes of quasi-circular, spinning, non-precessing binary black hole mergers

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00052
 - **Abstract**
 We introduce spatiotemporal-graph models that concurrently process data from the twin advanced LIGO detectors and the advanced Virgo detector. We trained these AI classifiers with 2.4 million \texttt{IMRPhenomXPHM} waveforms that describe quasi-circular, spinning, non-precessing binary black hole mergers with component masses $m_{\{1,2\}}\in[3M_\odot, 50 M_\odot]$, and individual spins $s^z_{\{1,2\}}\in[-0.9, 0.9]$; and which include the $(\ell, |m|) = \{(2, 2), (2, 1), (3, 3), (3, 2), (4, 4)\}$ modes, and mode mixing effects in the $\ell = 3, |m| = 2$ harmonics. We trained these AI classifiers within 22 hours using distributed training over 96 NVIDIA V100 GPUs in the Summit supercomputer. We then used transfer learning to create AI predictors that estimate the total mass of potential binary black holes identified by all AI classifiers in the ensemble. We used this ensemble, 3 AI classifiers and 2 predictors, to process a year-long test set in which we injected 300,000 signals. This year-long test set was processed within 5.19 minutes using 1024 NVIDIA A100 GPUs in the Polaris supercomputer (for AI inference) and 128 CPU nodes in the ThetaKNL supercomputer (for post-processing of noise triggers), housed at the Argonne Leadership Supercomputing Facility. These studies indicate that our AI ensemble provides state-of-the-art signal detection accuracy, and reports 2 misclassifications for every year of searched data. This is the first AI ensemble designed to search for and find higher order gravitational wave mode signals.
#### Detectability of the Yarkovsky Effect in the Main Belt

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00055
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00055
 - **Abstract**
 We attempt to detect signal of Yarkovsky-related acceleration in the orbits of 134 main belt asteroids (MBAs) we observed with the University of Hawai'i 88-inch telescope, supplemented with observations publicly available from the Minor Planet Center and Gaia Data Release 3. We estimated expected Yarkovsky acceleration values based on parameters derived through thermophysical modeling, but we were not able to find any reliable detections of Yarkovsky in our sample. Through tests with synthetic observations however, we estimated the minimum observational arc length needed to detect the Yarkovsky effect for all of our sample MBAs, which in nearly every case exceeded the current arc length of the existing observations. We find that the Yarkovsky effect could be detectable within a couple of decades of discovery for a 100-m MBA assuming 0.1" astrometric accuracy, which is at the size range detectable by the upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.
#### Kinetic relaxation and nucleation of Bose stars in self-interacting wave  dark matter

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00058
 - **Abstract**
 We revisit kinetic relaxation and soliton/Boson star nucleation in fuzzy scalar dark matter featuring short-ranged self-interactions $\mathcal{H}_{\rm int} = -\lambda|\psi|^4/2m^2$, alongside gravitational self-interactions. We map out the full curve of nucleation timescale for both repulsive ($\lambda < 0$) and attractive ($\lambda > 0$) short-ranged self-interaction strength, and in doing so reveal two new points. Firstly, besides the two usual terms, $\propto G^2$ and $\propto \lambda^2$, in the total relaxation rate $\Gamma_{\rm relax}$, there is an additional cross term $\propto G\lambda$ arising due to interference between gravitational and short-ranged self-interaction scattering amplitudes. This yields a critical repulsive interaction strength $\lambda_{\rm cr} \simeq - 2\pi Gm^2/v_{0}^2$, at which the relaxation rate is smallest and serves as the transition point between typical net attractive self-interaction ($\lambda \gtrsim \lambda_{\rm cr}$), and net repulsive self-interaction ($-\lambda \gtrsim -\lambda_{\rm cr}$). Secondly, while in the net attractive regime, nucleation time scale is similar to inverse relaxation time scale $\tau_{\rm nuc} \sim \Gamma^{-1}_{\rm relax}$, in the net repulsive regime nucleation occurs at a delayed time $\tau_{\rm nuc} \sim (\lambda/\lambda_{\rm cr})\Gamma^{-1}_{\rm relax}$. We confirm our analytical understanding by performing 3D field simulations with varying average mass density $\bar{\rho}$, box size $L$ and grid size $N$.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery and timing follow-up of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are necessary not just for their usefulness in Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) but also for investigating their own intriguing properties. In this work, we provide the findings of the decade-long timing of the four MSPs discovered by Giant Metre-wave Radio Telescope (GMRT), including their timing precision, model parameters, and newly detected proper motions. We compare the timing results for these MSPs before and after the GMRT upgrade in 2017, characterising the improvement in timing precision due to the bandwidth upgrade. We discuss the suitability of these four GMRT MSPs for the PTA experiments as well as the usefulness of their decade-long timing data in the global effort to improve the signal-to-noise (S/N) of recently detected signature of gravitational waves in cross-correlation statistics of residuals of MSPs.

 - **Abstract**
 As astronomical data grows in volume and complexity, the scalability of analysis software becomes increasingly important. At the same time, astrophysics analysis software relies heavily on open-source contributions, so languages and tools that prioritize both performance and readability are especially valuable. Julia, with its just-in-time compiler and high level syntax, offers a compelling alternative to traditional languages like Python or C. In this paper, we outline ShOpt.jl, a new software package for point spread function (PSF) characterization written in Julia. ShOpt.jl features a number of performance optimizations, such as multithreading, the use of preconditioners, and the implementation of the memory-limited Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm, as well as the flexibility to choose between principal component analysis, an autoencoder, and analytic profiles for PSF characterization. As observatories like the James Webb Space Telescope bring astrophysics into a new era of wide-field, high-resolution imaging, the challenges of PSF modeling become more pronounced. Tools like ShOpt.jl provide the community with a scalable, efficient, and accurate solution to these challenges, while also demonstrating the potential of Julia as a language that meets the demands of modern astrophysical research.
#### Can Uranus and Neptune form concurrently via pebble, gas and  planetesimal accretion?

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of Uranus and Neptune has long been challenging to explain, due to the large orbital distances from the Sun. After a planetary embryo has been formed, the main accretion processes are likely pebble, gas and planetesimal accretion. Previous studies of Uranus and Neptune formation typically don't consider all three processes; and furthermore, do not investigate how the formation of the outer planet impacts the inner planet. In this paper we study the concurrent formation of Uranus and Neptune via both pebble, gas and planetesimal accretion. We use a dust-evolution model to predict the size and mass flux of pebbles, and derive our own fit for gas accretion. We do not include migration, but consider a wide range of formation locations between 12 and 40au. If the planetary embryos form at the same time and with the same mass, our formation model with an evolving dust population is unable to produce Uranus and Neptune analogues. This is because the mass difference between the planets and the H-He mass fractions become too high. However, if the outer planetary embryo forms earlier and/or more massive than the inner embryo, the two planets do form in a few instances when the disk is metal-rich and dissipates after a few Myr. Furthermore, our study suggests that in-situ formation is rather unlikely. Nethertheless, giant impacts and/or migration could potentially aid in the formation, and future studies including these processes could bring us one step closer to understanding how Uranus and Neptune formed.
#### Early Accretion of Large Amount of Solids for Directly-Imaged Exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 As the number of planetary mass objects (PMOs, $\lessapprox$13 M$_{\rm{Jupitr}}$) at wider separation ($\gtrapprox$10 AU) grows, there is emerging evidence that they form differently from their higher-mass brown-dwarf (BD) counterparts. Namely, PMOs' atmospheres are enriched by metals which is usually interpreted as a sign of solid accretion. This points to the formation channel through core accretion. However, there has hitherto been no quantitative analysis at population level to investigate the amount and timing of solid accretion. Here, we analyze a sample of five directly-imaged exoplanets with measured stellar and planetary chemical abundances (51 Eri b, $\beta$ Pic b, HIP 65426 b, and HR 8799 c and e). We show that these PMOs accrete large amount of solids regardless of formation channels. On average $\gtrapprox$100 M$_\oplus$ solids (ranging from 98.6 to 845.2 M$_\oplus$ for individual systems) are accreted to enrich planet atmospheres if forming via core accretion whereas the solid accretion needs to be $\gtrapprox$20 M$_\oplus$ (ranging from 22.4 to 782.3 M$_\oplus$) if forming via gravitational instability. The result implies that the solid accretion process has to happen at an early stage ($<$1 Myr) when large amount of solids are available in young protoplanetary disks.
#### Spectral Retrieval with JWST Photometric data: a Case Study for HIP  65426 b

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00089
 - **Abstract**
 Half of the JWST high-contrast imaging objects will only have photometric data {{as of Cycle 2}}. However, to better understand their atmospheric chemistry which informs formation origin, spectroscopic data are preferred. Using HIP 65426 b, we investigate to what extent planet properties and atmospheric chemical abundance can be retrieved with only JWST photometric data points (2.5-15.5 $\mu$m) in conjunction with ground-based archival low-resolution spectral data (1.0-2.3 $\mu$m). We find that the data is consistent with an atmosphere with solar metallicity and C/O ratios at 0.40 and 0.55. We rule out 10x solar metallicity and an atmosphere with C/O = 1.0. We also find strong evidence of silicate clouds but no sign of an enshrouding featureless {{dust}} extinction. This work offers guidance and cautionary tales on analyzing data in the absence of medium-to-high resolution spectral data.
#### Introducing the Condor Array Telescope: III. The expansion and age of  the shell of the dwarf nova Z Camelopardalis, and detection of a second,  larger shell

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of a vast nova shell surrounding the prototypical dwarf nova Z Camelopardalis (Z Cam) proves that some old novae undergo metamorphosis to appear as dwarf novae thousands of years after a nova eruption. The expansion rates of ancient nova shells offer a way to constrain both the time between nova eruptions and the time for post-nova mass transfer rates to decrease significantly, simultaneously testing nova thermonuclear runaway models and hibernation theory. Previous limits on the expansion rate of part of the Z Cam shell constrain the inter-eruption time between Z Cam nova events to be $>$ 1300 years. Deeper narrow-band imaging of the ejecta of Z Cam with the Condor Array Telescope now reveals very low surface brightness areas of the remainder of the shell. A second, even fainter shell is also detected, concentric with and nearly three times the size of the "inner" shell. This is the first observational support of the prediction that concentric shells must surround the frequently-erupting novae of relatively massive white dwarfs. The Condor images extend our Z Cam imaging baseline to 15 years, yielding the inner shell's expansion rate as $v = 83 \pm 37$ km s$^{-1}$ at 23 degrees South of West, in excellent agreement with our 2012 prediction. This velocity corresponds to an approximate age of $t = 2672^{-817}_{+2102}$ yr. While consistent with the suggestion that the most recent nova eruption of Z Cam was the transient recorded by Chinese Imperial astrologers in the year 77 BCE, the age uncertainty is still too large to support or disprove a connection with Z Cam.
#### The High-Energy Spectrum of the Young Planet Host V1298 Tau

 - **Abstract**
 V1298 Tau is a young pre-main sequence star hosting four known exoplanets that are prime targets for transmission spectroscopy with current-generation instruments. This work pieces together observations from the NICER X-ray telescope, the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and Cosmic Origins Spectrograph instruments aboard Hubble Space Telescope, and empirically informed models to create a panchromatic spectral energy distribution for V1298 Tau spanning 1 to 100000 Angstroms. We describe the methods and assumptions used to assemble the panchromatic spectrum and show that despite this star's brightness, its high-energy spectrum is near the limit of present X-ray and ultraviolet observatories' abilities to characterize. We conclude by using the V1298 Tau spectrum as a benchmark for the activity saturation stage of high-energy radiation from solar-mass stars to compare the lifetime cumulative high-energy irradiation of the V1298 Tau planets to other planets orbiting similarly massive stars.
#### An efficient and robust method to estimate halo concentration

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00200
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00200
 - **Abstract**
 We propose an efficient and robust method to estimate the halo concentration based on the first moment of the density distribution, which is $R_1\equiv \int_0^{r_{\rm vir}}4\pi r^3\rho(r)dr/M_{\rm vir}/r_{\rm vir}$. We find that $R_1$ has a monotonic relation with the concentration parameter of the NFW profile, and that a cubic polynomial function can fit the relation with an error $\lesssim 3\%$. Tests on ideal NFW halos show that the conventional NFW profile fitting method and the $V_{\rm max}/V_{\rm vir}$ method produce biased halo concentration estimation by $\approx 10\%$ and $\approx 30\%$, respectively, for halos with 100 particles. In contrast, the systematic error for our $R_1$ method is smaller than $0.5\%$ even for halos containing only 100 particles. Convergence tests on realistic halos in $N$-body simulations show that the NFW profile fitting method underestimates the concentration parameter for halos with $\lesssim 300$ particles by $\gtrsim 20\%$, while the error for the $R_1$ method is $\lesssim 8\%$. We also show other applications of $R_1$, including estimating $V_{\rm max}$ and the Einasto concentration $c_{\rm e}\equiv r_{\rm vir}/r_{-2}$. The calculation of $R_1$ is efficient and robust, and we recommend including it as one of the halo properties in halo catalogs of cosmological simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The black hole (BH) mass and luminosity are key factors in determining how a quasar interacts with its environment. In this study, we utilise data from the European Southern Observatory Large Programme XQ-100, a high-quality sample of 100 X-shooter spectra of the most luminous quasars in the redshift range $3.5 < z < 4.5$, and measure the properties of three prominent optical and ultraviolet broad emission-lines present in the wide wavelength coverage of X-shooter: CIV, MgII, and H$\beta$. The line properties of all three broad lines are used for virial estimates of the BH mass and their resulting mass estimates for this sample are tightly correlated. The BH mass range is $\log{(\rm{M_{BH}}/\rm{M_\odot})} = 8.6-10.3$ with bolometric luminosities estimated from the 3000A continuum in the range $\log{(\rm{L_{bol}}/\rm{erg\,s^{-1}})} = 46.7-48.0$. Robustly determined properties of these quasars enable a variety of follow-up research in quasar astrophysics, from chemical abundance and evolution in the broad-line region to radiatively driven quasar outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 The HADAR experiment, which will be constructed in Tibet, China, combines the wide-angle advantages of traditional EAS array detectors with the high sensitivity advantages of focused Cherenkov detectors. Its physics objective is to observe transient sources such as gamma-ray bursts and counterparts of gravitational waves. The aim of this study is to utilize the latest AI technology to enhance the sensitivity of the HADAR experiment. We have built training datasets and models with distinctive creativity by incorporating relevant physical theories for various applications. They are able to determine the kind, energy, and direction of incident particles after careful design. We have obtained a background identification accuracy of 98.6\%, a relative energy reconstruction error of 10.0\%, and an angular resolution of 0.22-degrees in a test dataset at 10 TeV. These findings demonstrate the enormous potential for enhancing the precision and dependability of detector data analysis in astrophysical research. Thanks to deep learning techniques, the HADAR experiment's observational sensitivity to the Crab Nebula has surpassed that of MAGIC and H.E.S.S. at energies below 0.5 TeV and remains competitive with conventional narrow-field Cherenkov telescopes at higher energies. Additionally, our experiment offers a fresh approach to dealing with strongly connected scattered data.

 With the exponential growth in data volume, especially in recent decades, the demand for data processing has surged across all scientific fields. Within astronomical datasets, the combination of solar space missions and ground-based telescopes has yielded high spatial and temporal resolutions for observing the Sun, thus fueling an increase in the utilization of automatic image processing approaches. Image processing methodologies play a pivotal role in analyzing solar data, a critical component in comprehending the Sun's behavior and its influence on Earth. This paper provides an overview of the utilization of diverse processing techniques applied to images captured from the solar photosphere. The introduction of our manuscript furnishes a description of the solar photosphere along with its primary characteristics. Subsequently, we endeavor to outline the significance of preprocessing photospheric images, a crucial prerequisite before engaging in any form of analysis. The subsequent section delves into an examination of numerous reputable sources that have employed image processing methodologies in their research pertaining to the Sun's surface. This section also encompasses discussions concerning recent advancements in image processing techniques for solar data analysis and their potential implications for future solar research. The final section deliberates on post-processing procedures as supplementary steps that are essential for deriving meaningful results from raw data. Effectively, this paper imparts vital information, offering concise explanations regarding the Sun's surface, the application of image processing techniques to various types of photospheric images, indispensable image preprocessing stages, and post-processing procedures aimed at transforming raw data into coherent and comprehensive insights.

 - **Abstract**
 Disc warping, and possibly disc breaking, has been observed in protoplanetary discs around both single and multiple stars. Large disc warps can break the disc, producing observational signatures in kinematics and shadowing along the outer disc. In this work, we use comparisons of disc timescales to derive updated formulae for disc breaking, with better predictions as to when and where a disc is expected to break and how many breaks could occur. Disc breaking is more likely for discs with small inner cavities, cooler temperatures, and steeper power-law profiles. Thus, thin, polar-aligned discs are more likely to break. We test our analytic formulae using 3D grid-based simulations of protoplanetary discs warped by the gravitational torque of an inner binary. We reproduce the expected warp behaviors in different viscosity regimes and observe disc breaking at locations in agreement with our derived equations. As disc breaking is observed only for discs with low viscosity, we also consider a viscous criterion for disc breaking, where rapid alignment to the precession vector can prevent a break by reducing the maximum misalignment between neighboring rings. We apply these results to the GW Orionis circumtriple disc, and find that the precession induced from the central stars can break the disc if the disc is relatively thin. We expect repeated or multiple disc breaking to occur for discs with sufficiently steep power law profiles. We simulate a disc with steep power-law profiles, and observe two separate breaking events at locations in rough agreement with our analytical predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 What was the nature of the Late Hesperian climate? Warm and wet or cold and dry? Formulated this way the question leads to an apparent paradox since both options seem implausible. A warm and wet climate would have produced extensive fluvial erosion but few valley networks have been observed at the age of the late Hesperian. A too cold climate would have kept any northern ocean frozen most of the time. A moderate cold climate would have transferred the water from the ocean to the land in the form of snow and ice. But this would prevent tsunami formation, for which there is some evidence. Here, we provide new insights from numerical climate simulations in agreement with surface geological features to demonstrate that the Martian climate could have been both cold and wet. Using an advanced General Circulation Model (GCM), we demonstrate that an ocean can be stable, even if the Martian mean surface temperature is lower than 0$^\circ$C. Rainfall is moderate near the shorelines and in the ocean. The southern plateau is mostly covered by ice with a mean temperature below 0$^\circ$C and a glacier return flow back to the ocean. This climate is achieved with a 1 bar CO$_2$ dominated atmosphere with 10\% H$_2$. Under this scenario 3 Ga, the geologic evidence of a shoreline and tsunami deposits along the ocean/land dichotomy are compatible with ice sheets and glacial valleys in the southern highlands.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new measurements of the mean transmitted flux in the hydrogen Lyman-alpha and Lyman-beta forest using 27,008 quasar spectra from the Fourteenth Data Release (DR14) of the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). Individual spectra are first combined into 16 composites with mean redshifts in the range of 2.8 < z < 4.9. We then apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference to produce a piecewise fit of the effective {\tau_{Ly\alpha}} (corrected for metal lines and optically thick absorptions) and relative {\Delta}{\tau_{Ly\beta}} optical depths. A detailed evaluation of our large data set shows a systematic offset towards lower values of {\tau_{Ly\alpha}} compared to recent results by Kamble et al. (2020) based on SDSS DR12.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-metallicity very massive stars with an initial mass of $\sim 140$--$260\, {\rm M_\odot}$ are expected to end their lives as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe). The abundance pattern resulting from a PISN differs drastically from regular core-collapse supernova (CCSN) models and is expected to be seen in very metal-poor (VMP) stars of ${\rm[Fe/H]}\lesssim -2$. Despite the routine discovery of many VMP stars, the unique abundance pattern expected from PISNe has not been unambiguously detected. The recently discovered VMP star LAMOST J1010+2358, however, shows a peculiar abundance pattern that is remarkably well fit by a PISN, indicating the potential first discovery of a bonafide star born from gas polluted by a PISN. In this paper, we study the detailed nucleosynthesis in a large set of models of CCSN of Pop III and Pop II star of metallicity ${\rm[Fe/H]}=-3$ with masses ranging from $12$--$30\,{\rm M_\odot}$. We find that the observed abundance pattern in LAMOST J1010+2358 can be fit at least equally well by CCSN models of $\sim 12$--$14\,{\rm M_\odot}$ that undergo negligible fallback following the explosion. The best-fit CCSN models provide a fit that is even marginally better than the best-fit PISN model. We conclude the measured abundance pattern in LAMOST J1010+2358 could have originated from a CCSN and therefore cannot be unambiguously identified with a PISN given the set of elements measured in it to date. We identify key elements that need to be measured in future detections in stars like LAMOST J1010+2358 that can differentiate between CCSN and PISN origin.

 - **Abstract**
 The plateau phase in the radio afterglows has been observed in very few gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and 27 radio light curves with plateau phase were acquired from the published literature in this article. We obtain the related parameters of the radio plateau, such as temporal indexes during the plateau phase ($\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$), break time ($\Tbz$) and the corresponding radio flux ($F_{\rm b}$). The two parameter Dainotti relation between the break time of the plateau and the corresponding break luminosity ($\Lbz$) in radio band is $\Lbz \propto \Tbz^{-1.20\pm0.24}$. Including the isotropic energy $\Eiso$ and the peak energy $\Epi$, the three parameter correlations for the radio plateaus are written as $\Lbz \propto \Tbz^{-1.01 \pm 0.24} \Eiso^{0.18 \pm 0.09}$ and $\Lbz \propto \Tbz^{-1.18 \pm 0.27} \Epi^{0.05 \pm 0.28}$, respectively. The correlations are less consistent with that of X-ray and optical plateaus, implying that radio plateaus may have a different physical mechanism. The typical frequencies crossing the observational band may be a reasonable hypothesis that causes the breaks of the radio afterglows. We calibrate GRBs empirical luminosity correlations as standard candle for constraining cosmological parameters, and find that our samples can constrain the flat $\Lambda$CDM model well, while are not sensitive to non-flat ${\Lambda}$CDM model. By combining GRBs with other probes, such as SN and CMB, the constraints on cosmological parameters are $\om = 0.297\pm0.006$ for the flat ${\Lambda}$CDM model and $\om = 0.283\pm0.008$, $\oL = 0.711\pm0.006$ for the non-flat ${\Lambda}$CDM model, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Near the center of the Puppis A SNR a series of nested optically emitting rings of high velocity ejecta (known as `the Swirl') were identified several decades ago by Winkler et al. (1989). To date no follow-up observations of these rings have been published, and their physical origin has remained a mystery. We present results of integral field spectroscopy of the Swirl using the Wide Field Integral Spectrograph (\wifes) on the 2.3\,m telescope at Siding Spring Observatory in Australia. The outermost ring exhibits a nitrogen-rich spectrum blueshifted to 1350 km/s, with smaller blueshifted rings within the first exhibiting mostly oxygen-rich spectra moving at 1000 km/s and 750 km/s. The structures are connected by material of intermediate velocity and variable composition, including sulfur-rich material. The Swirl is turbulent and shock excited, and contains as much as 0.5 M$_{\odot}$ of metal-rich material. The chemical composition and exclusively blueshifted radial velocities of the Swirl are consistent with progressively deeper nucleosynthetic layers in a massive progenitor star. We suggest the possibility that the Swirl marks a `funnel' carved into the supernova ejecta by a close, massive binary companion at the moment of explosion.
#### Tension between HST/JWST and $Λ$CDM Cosmology, PBH, and Antimatter  in the Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 Recent data released by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and, somewhat earlier, the data presented by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) are commonly understood as a strong indication for breaking of the canonical $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. It is argued in the presented work that massive primordial black holes (PBH) could seed galaxy and quasar formation in the very young universe as it has been conjectured in our paper of 1993 and resolve the tension induced by the JWST and the HST data with the standard cosmology. This point of view is presently supported by several recent works. The proposed mechanism of PBH formation leads to the log-normal mass spectrum of PBHs and predicts abundant antimatter population of our Galaxy, Milky Way. Both these predictions are in excellent agreement with astronomical observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: We are testing strong equivalence principle with planetary ephemerides in the frame of the Brans-Dicke class of scalar tensor theories. Aims: In this work, we apply our recently proposed Bayesian methodology on the Brans-Dicke case, with an emphasis on the issue of the strong equivalence principle. Methods: We compare the posterior distributions obtained fully consistently in this case with the preceding Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) integrations in planetary ephemerides, which did not incorporate potential violations of the strong equivalence principle. Results: We observe a shift in the confidence levels of the posteriors obtained. We interpret this shift as marginal evidence suggesting that the effect of the Strong Equivalence Principle violation can no longer be neglected in planetary ephemerides. We also notably report that the constraint on the Brans-Dicke parameter with planetary ephemerides is getting closer to the figure reported from the Cassini spacecraft alone, but also to the constraints from pulsars. We anticipate that data from future spacecraft missions, such as BepiColombo, will significantly enhance the constraint with planetary ephemerides.

 - **Abstract**
 The Low-Energy X-ray Polarization Detector (LPD) is one of the payloads in the POLAR-2 experiment, designed as an external payload for the China Space Station (CSS) deployment in early 2024. LPD is specifically designed to observe the polarization of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) prompt emission in the energy range of 2-10 keV, with a wide field of view (FoV) of 90 degrees in preliminary design. This observation is achieved using an array of X-ray photoelectric polarimeters based on gas pixel detectors. Due to the wide FoV configuration, the in-orbit background count rate in the soft X-ray range is high, while GRBs themselves also exhibit a high flux in this energy band. In order to assess the contribution of various background components to the total count rate, we conducted detailed simulations using the GEANT4 C++ package. Our simulations encompassed the main interactions within the instrument materials and provided insights into various background components within the wide FoV scheme. The simulation results reveal that among the background components, the primary contributors are the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) and bright X-ray sources. The total background count rate of LPD, after applying the charged particle background rejection algorithm, is approximately 0.55 counts/cm^2/s on average, and it varies with the detector's orbit and pointing direction. Furthermore, we performed comprehensive simulations and comparative analyses of the CXB and X-ray bright sources under different FoVs and detector pointings. These analyses provide valuable insights into the background characteristic for soft X-ray polarimeter with wide FoV.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrometric studies and orbital modeling of planetary moons have contributed significantly to advancing our understanding of their orbital dynamics. These studies require precise positions measured over extended periods. In this paper, we present the results of the 2021 Brazilian Jovian mutual phenomena campaign. The data correspond to eight events between Galilean satellites, in addition to a rare eclipse of Thebe, an inner satellite, totaling nine events. A geometric model along with the DE440/JUP365 ephemerides was used to reproduce the events and simulate the light curves. A Monte Carlo method and chi-squared statistics were used to fit the simulated light curves to the observations. The reflectance model adopted for our simulations was the complete version of the Oren-Nayer model. The average uncertainty of the relative positions of the Galilean satellites was 5 mas (15 km) and for the inner Thebe satellite 32 mas (96 km). The seven mutual events (nine independent observations) here analyzed represent and addition of 17% events (10% light curves) with respect to the PHEMU21 international campaign. Furthermore, our result of Thebe eclipse is only the second measurement published to date. Our results contribute to the ephemeris database, being fundamental to improving satellite orbits and thus minimizing their uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate exact and approximate techniques to calculate the emission of gravitational radiation from cosmic string loops in order to generate beam models covering the entire celestial sphere for a wide range of modes $m$. One approach entails summing over contributions of stationary and nearly-stationary points of individual, factorized, left- and right-moving modes. This ``multipoint method" generalizes traditional methods that rely on expansions around exact stationary points of mode products. A second complementary approach extends the method of steepest descent to generate an asymptotic description of the beam as $m \to \infty$. We present example calculations of the emission of power from cusp-containing loops and compare the results with those obtained by numerically exact techniques as well as by previous approaches. The multipoint method achieves its best results at an intermediate range of modes, improving over previous methods in terms of accuracy. It handles the emission from all regions of the loop not just those near cusps. We demonstrate this capability by making a detailed study of the ``pseudocusp" phenomenon.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for exoplanets has revealed a diversity of planetary system architectures, the vast majority of which diverge significantly from the template of the solar system. In particular, giant planets beyond the snow line are relatively rare, especially for low-mass stars, placing the solar system within a small category of systems with multiple giant planets at large separations. An exoplanetary system of note is that of HD 141399, consisting of a K dwarf host star that harbors four giant planets with separations extending to $\sim$4.5 AU. The architecture of the system creates a complex pattern of mean motion resonances and gravitationally perturbed regions that may exclude the presence of other planets, including within the Habitable Zone of the system. Here, we present the results of dynamical simulations that explore the interaction of the known planets of the system, their apsidal trajectories, resonance locations, and dynamical evolution. We further investigate the results of injecting Earth-mass planets and provide the regions of dynamical viability within the Habitable Zone where terrestrial planets may maintain long-term stability. We discuss these results in the context of the importance of giant planets for volatile delivery and planetary habitability considerations.

 - **Abstract**
 With advancements in low-cost launchers and small interplanetary spacecraft, NASA has recognized the potential of small missions to perform focused planetary science investigations at Mars and Venus. The EscaPADE, part of the NASA SIMPLEx program will deliver two small spacecraft to elliptical orbits around Mars using the Photon spacecraft. Orbit insertion, particularly to low-circular orbits requires significant propellant, taking up a substantial fraction of the Photon wet mass and present a significant challenge for small missions. The large $\Delta$V requirements for low-circular orbit make it difficult to insert small satellites into these orbits even with the highly capable Photon, as the total $\Delta$V for Earth escape and orbit insertion exceeds its capability. Drag modulation aerocapture offers a promising alternative, using the atmospheric drag to obtain the large $\Delta$V. The study shows how the Photon when combined with drag modulation aerocapture can deliver small orbiters to low-circular orbits, enabling a wide range of small orbiter missions. Aerocapture eliminates the need for Photon to provide 2 to 3.5 km/s of $\Delta$V for orbit insertion, which translate into mass and cost savings, and can enable frequent low-cost small orbiters and small satellite constellations at Mars and Venus in the near future.
#### The period bouncer system SDSS J105754.25+275947.5: first radial  velocity study

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first radial velocity spectroscopic study of the eclipsing period bouncer SDSS J105754.25+275947.5. Together with eclipse light curve modeling, we redetermined the system parameters and studied the accretion disk structure. We confirm that the system contains a white dwarf with $M_{\mathrm{WD}}=0.83(3) M_\odot$ and an effective temperature of 11,500(400)K. The mass of the secondary is $M_2 = 0.056 M_\odot$ with an effective temperature of T$_2$=2,100K or below. The system inclination is $i=84.3(6)$. The data is in good agreement with our determination of $K_1$ = 33(4) km s$^{-1}$. We estimate the mass transfer rate as $\dot{M}=$1.9(2)$\times 10^{-11} M_\odot yr^{-1}$. Based on an analysis of the SDSS and OSIRIS spectra, we conclude that the optical continuum is formed predominantly by the radiation from the white dwarf. The contribution of the accretion disk is low and originates from the outer part of the disk. The Balmer emission lines are formed in a plasma with $\log$ $N_0$ = 12.7 [cm$^{-1}$] and a kinetic temperature of T$\sim$10,000K. The size of the disk, where the emission lines are formed, expands up to $R_\mathrm{d,out}=0.29 R_\odot$. The inner part of the emission line forming region goes down to $R_\mathrm{d,in}\approx 2 R_\mathrm{WD}$ . The Doppler tomography and trailed spectra show the presence of a hot spot and a clumpy structure in the disk, with variable intensity along the disk position angle. There is an extended region at the side opposite the hot spot with two bright clumps caused more probably by non-Keplerian motion there.

 - **Abstract**
 The recently identified source class of pulsar halos may be populated and bright enough at TeV energies to constitute a large fraction of the sources that will be observed with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), especially in the context of the planned Galactic Plane Survey (GPS). In this study, we examine the prospects offered by CTA for the detection and characterization of such objects. CTA will cover energies from 20 GeV to 300 TeV, bridging the ranges already probed with the Fermi Large Area Telescope and High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory, and will also have a better angular resolution than the latter instruments, thus providing a complementary look at the phenomenon. From simple models for individual pulsar halos and their population in the Milky Way, we examine under which conditions such sources can be detected and studied from the GPS observations. In the framework of a full spatial-spectral likelihood analysis, using the most recent estimates for the instrument response function and prototypes for the science tools, we derive the spectral and morphological sensitivity of the CTA GPS to the specific intensity distribution of pulsar halos. From these, we quantify the physical parameters for which pulsar halos can be detected, identified, and characterized, and what fraction of the Galactic population could be accessible. We also discuss the effect of interstellar emission and data analysis systematics on these prospects.

 - **Abstract**
 Dusty starless cores play an important role in regulating the initial phases of the formation of stars and planets. In their interiors, dust grains coagulate and ice mantles form, thereby changing the millimeter emissivities and hence the ability to cool. We mapped four regions with more than a dozen cores in the nearby Galactic filaments of Taurus and Perseus using the NIKA-2 camera at the IRAM 30-meter telescope. Combining the 1mm to 2mm flux ratio maps with dust temperature maps from Herschel allowed to create maps of the dust emissivity index beta1,2 at resolutions of 2430 and 5600a.u. in Taurus and Perseus, respectively. Here, we study the variation with total column densities and environment. Beta1,2 values at the core centers (Av=12-19mag) vary significantly between ~1.1 and 2.3. Several cores show a strong rise of beta1,2 from the outskirts at ~4mag to the peaks of optical extinctions, consistent with the predictions of grain models and the gradual build-up of ice mantles on coagulated grains in the dense interiors of starless cores.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a Bayesian inference method to characterise the dust emission properties using the well-known dust-\hi\ correlation in the diffuse interstellar medium at Planck frequencies $\nu \ge 217$\,GHz. We use the Galactic \hi\ map from the Galactic All-Sky Survey (GASS) as a template to trace the Galactic dust emission. We jointly infer the pixel-dependent dust emissivity and the zero level present in the Planck intensity maps. We use the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo technique to sample the multi-dimensional parameter space. We demonstrate that the methodology is unbiased when applied to realistic Planck sky simulations over a 7500 deg$^2$ area around the Southern Galactic pole. As an application on data, we analyse the Planck intensity map at 353 GHz to jointly infer the pixel-dependent dust emissivity at $\Nside=32$ resolution (1.8\deg\ pixel size) and the global offset. We find that the spatially varying dust emissivity has a mean of 0.031 $\MJysr (10^{20} \mathrm{cm^{-2}})^{-1}$ and $1\sigma$ standard deviation of 0.007 $\MJysr (10^{20} \mathrm{cm^{-2}})^{-1}$. The mean dust emissivity increases monotonically with increasing mean \hi\ column density. We find that the inferred global offset is consistent with the expected level of Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) monopole added to the Planck data at 353 GHz. This method is useful in studying the line-of-sight variations of dust spectral energy distribution in the multi-phase interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting any evolution of dimensionless in the ratios of physical quantities, such as the fine structure constant, would prove that the Weak Equivalence Principle is violated and lead to a paradigm shift in physics. High resolution spectroscopy of quasar absorption systems can be used to test cosmological variations in time and/or in space. A sample of 300 measurements using data from 8m class optical telescopes provides hints that such variations are indeed present in a form of a spatial dipole across the sky, although systematic effects could dominate. Two recent developments, one in instrumentation and the other in analysis methods, promise to produce a new sample of measurements free from all known systematic effects to test the tentative dipole.
#### Probing orbital parameters of gamma-ray binaries with TeV light curves

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray binaries are binary systems where the energy flux peaks in the gamma-ray energy band. They harbour a compact object (a neutron star or a black hole) orbiting around a massive star that provides a strong radiation field. It is believed that the gamma-ray emission from such objects can be strongly attenuated through the electron-positron pair production in gamma-gamma interactions. The importance of gamma-gamma absorption depends on the orbital phase and on the geometry of the system. In this work we propose a method of how the orbital parameters of gamma-ray binaries could be probed with TeV light curves that have imprinted features of gamma-gamma absorption.
#### Centaurus A: Exploring the Nature of the Hard X-ray/Soft Gamma-ray  Emission with INTEGRAL

 - **Abstract**
 The question of the origin of the hard X-ray/soft gamma-ray emission in Centaurus A (Cen A) persists despite decades of observations. Results from X-ray instruments suggest a jet origin since the implied electron temperature (kT_e) would cause pair production runaway in the corona. In contrast, instruments sensitive to soft gamma-rays report electron temperatures indicating a corona origin may be possible. In this context, we analyzed archival INTEGRAL/IBIS-ISGRI and SPI data and observations from a 2022 Cen A monitoring program. Our analysis did not find any spectral variability. Thus we combined all observations for long-term average spectra, which were fit with a NuSTAR observation to study the 3.5 keV - 2.2 MeV spectrum. Spectral fits using a CompTT model found kT_e ~ 550 keV, near pair-production runaway. The spectrum was also well described by a log-parabola to model synchrotron self-Compton emission from the jet. Additionally, a spectral fit with the 12-year catalog Fermi/LAT spectrum using a log-parabola can explain the data up to ~ 3 GeV. Above ~ 3 GeV, a power-law excess is present, which has been previously reported in LAT/H.E.S.S. analysis. However, including a corona spectral component can also describe the data well. In this scenario, the hard X-rays/soft gamma-rays are due the corona and the MeV to GeV emission is due to the jet.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cherenkov Telescope Array will be the next generation ground-based gamma ray observatory in the energy range from a few tens of GeV to hundreds of TeV. It will be built on two sites, one for each hemisphere, to cover the entire sky. The observatory will consist of telescopes of three different sizes: large, medium and small, with primary reflectors of 23, 11.5 and 4.3 m in diameter, respectively. The Small-Sized Telescopes (SSTs) will focus on the highest energies; at least 37 (and up to 70) will be deployed at the southern site in Paranal, Chile, covering several square kilometers. They will have a Schwarzschild-Couder dual-mirror design, with a primary reflector of about 4 meters in diameter. This configuration leads to a compact camera, with a diameter of about 50 cm and a weight of less than 100 kg. Its focal plane consists of 2048 Silicon Photomultiplier pixels, each one read independently by a state-of-the-art full waveform readout. The camera design is now in the final stage and the first components are being tested. In this contribution we discuss the design choices, and present test results from latest developments.

 - **Abstract**
 In a very recent work, [1] claim that the scenario of temperature inhomogeneities proposed by [2] ($t2$ > 0) is not able to explain the O$^{2+}$/H$^{+}$ abundance discrepancy observed between the calculations based on the optical [OIII] collisional excited lines (CELs) and the OII recombination lines (RLs) in the star forming galaxy Mrk71. In this work, we show that conclusions of [1] depend on several assumptions on the absolute flux calibration, reddening correction and the adopted electron density. In fact, using the data of [1] in a different way and even considering their 1{\sigma} uncertainties, it is possible to reach the opposite conclusion, consistent with $t2$ = $0.097 ^{+0.008}_{-0.009}$. Therefore, the existence of temperature inhomogeneities causing the O$^{2+}$/H$^{+}$ abundance discrepancy in Mrk71 can not be ruled out.

 - **Abstract**
 Exploring exoplanets has transformed our understanding of the universe by revealing many planetary systems that defy our current understanding. To study their atmospheres, spectroscopic observations are used to infer essential atmospheric properties that are not directly measurable. Estimating atmospheric parameters that best fit the observed spectrum within a specified atmospheric model is a complex problem that is difficult to model. In this paper, we present a multi-target probabilistic regression approach that combines deep learning and inverse modeling techniques within a multimodal architecture to extract atmospheric parameters from exoplanets. Our methodology overcomes computational limitations and outperforms previous approaches, enabling efficient analysis of exoplanetary atmospheres. This research contributes to advancements in the field of exoplanet research and offers valuable insights for future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 A key outstanding question in star and planet formation is how far the initial mass function of stars and sub-stellar objects extends, and whether or not there is a cut-off at the very lowest masses. Isolated objects in the planetary-mass domain below 13 Jupiter masses, where not even deuterium can fuse, are very challenging to observe as these objects are inherently faint. Nearby star-forming regions provide the best opportunity to search for them though: while they are young, they are still relatively warm and luminous at infrared wavelengths. Previous surveys have discovered a handful of such sources down to 3--5 Jupiter masses, around the minimum mass limit established for formation via the fragmentation of molecular clouds, but does the mass function extend further? In a new James Webb Space Telescope near-infrared survey of the inner Orion Nebula and Trapezium Cluster, we have discovered and characterised a sample of 540 planetary-mass candidates with masses down to 0.6 Jupiter masses, demonstrating that there is indeed no sharp cut-off in the mass function. Furthermore, we find that 9\% of the planetary-mass objects are in wide binaries, a result that is highly unexpected and which challenges current theories of both star and planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 In cluster cosmology, cluster masses are the main parameter of interest. They are needed to constrain cosmological parameters through the cluster number count. As the mass is not an observable, a scaling relation is needed to link cluster masses to the integrated Compton parameters Y, i.e. the Sunyaev-Zeldovich observable (SZ). Planck cosmological results obtained with cluster number counts are based on a scaling relation measured with clusters at low redshift ($z$<0.5) observed in SZ and X-ray. In the SZ Large Program (LPSZ) of the NIKA2 collaboration, the scaling relation will be obtained with a sample of 38 clusters at intermediate to high redshift ($0.5<z<0.9$) and observed at high angular resolution in both SZ and X-ray. Thanks to analytical simulation of LPSZ-like samples, we take into account the LPSZ selection function and correct for its effects. Besides, we show that white and correlated noises in the SZ maps do not affect the scaling relation estimation.

 - **Abstract**
 MeV neutrinos are produced in many astrophysical transients, such as stellar collapses and high-energy jets, where they play a role in sustaining and cooling energetic explosions. Detecting these neutrinos from sources outside the Milky Way is very difficult due to the small neutrino-nucleon cross section at MeV. Nevertheless, the non-observation of MeV neutrinos from high-energy transients may provide useful constraints on related neutrino production mechanisms where significant MeV production is expected. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, a cubic kilometer neutrino detector operating with nearly 100% uptime at the South Pole, is sensitive to bursts of MeV neutrinos from astrophysical sources in and beyond the Milky Way. In this work, we describe the MeV neutrino detection system of IceCube and show results from several categories of astrophysical transients.
#### Modelling the AM CVn and Double Detonation Supernova Progenitor Binary  System CD-30$^{\circ}$11223

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed modelling study of CD-30$^{\circ}$11223 (CD-30), a hot subdwarf (sdB)-white dwarf (WD) binary identified as a double detonation supernova progenitor, using the open-source stellar evolution software MESA. We focus on implementing binary evolution models carefully tuned to match the observed characteristics of the system including $\log g$ and $T_{\rm eff}$. For the first time, we account for the structure of the hydrogen envelope throughout the modelling, and find that the inclusion of element diffusion is important for matching the observed radius and temperature. We investigate the two sdB mass solutions (0.47 and 0.54 $M_{\odot}$) previously proposed for this system, strongly favouring the 0.47 $M_{\odot}$ solution. The WD cooling age is compared against the sdB age using our models, which suggest an sdB likely older than the WD, contrary to the standard assumption for compact sdB-WD binaries. Subsequently, we propose a possible alternate formation channel for CD-30. We also perform binary evolution modelling of the system to study various aspects such as mass transfer, orbital period evolution and luminosity evolution. Our models confirm CD-30 as a double detonation supernova progenitor, expected to explode $\approx55$ Myr from now. The WD accretes a $\approx0.17$ $M_{\odot}$ thick helium shell that causes a detonation, leaving a 0.30 $M_{\odot}$ sdB ejected at $\approx$750 km/s. The final 15 Myr of the system are characterised by helium accretion which dominates the system luminosity, possibly resembling an AM CVn-type system.

 - **Abstract**
 The asymmetric drift (AD) tomography in different populations will be helpful for us to better understand the disk kinematics, dynamics and rotation curves. Using the common stars from the LAMOST and Gaia surveys as well as circular velocity of Gaia DR3, we qualitatively explore the asymmetric drift distribution of the Galactic disk from 8$-$16 \,kpc. In the $R-Z$ plane, we find the asymmetric drift near the plane of the Galactic disk is small, and then gradually increases with the increase of the vertical distance, which makes the asymmetric drift appear as a ``horn" shape in the $R-Z$ plane. Meanwhile, we reveal that high [$\alpha$/Fe] populations have larger asymmetric drift than that in the low [$\alpha$/Fe] populations. The asymmetric drift around the solar location V$_a$ = 6 km s$^{-1}$ and the asymmetric drift median value of the whole sample is 16 km s$^{-1}$. Moreover, we also find that the asymmetric drift median value in the north (20 km s$^{-1}$) of the Galactic disk is larger than that in the south (13 km s$^{-1}$), all errors are within 2 km s$^{-1}$. Furthermore, when we investigate the asymmetric drift of the Galactic disk in the mono-age stellar populations, we also find that the older stellar populations have larger asymmetric drift and velocity dispersion which is consistent with predictions of previous numerical models. Finally, based on the chemistry, we unveil that the average asymmetric drift of the thick disk is much higher than that of the thin disk.
#### Estimators of Bolometric Luminosity and Black Hole Mass with  Mid-infrared Continuum Luminosities for Dust-obscured Quasars: Prevalence of  Dust-obscured SDSS Quasars

 - **Abstract**
 We present bolometric luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}$) and black hole (BH) mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) estimators based on mid-infrared (MIR) continuum luminosity (hereafter, $L_{\rm MIR}$) that are measured from infrared (IR) photometric data. The $L_{\rm MIR}$-based estimators are relatively immune from dust extinction effects, hence they can be used for dust-obscured quasars. To derive the $L_{\rm bol}$ and $M_{\rm BH}$ estimators, we use unobscured quasars selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar catalog, which have wide ranges of $L_{\rm bol}$ ($10^{44.62}$--$10^{46.16}$\,$\rm erg\,s^{-1}$) and $M_{\rm BH}$ ($10^{7.14}$--$10^{9.69}$\,$M_{\odot}$). We find empirical relations between (i) continuum luminosity at 5100\,$\rm{\AA{}}$ (hereafter, L5100) and $L_{\rm MIR}$; (ii) $L_{\rm bol}$ and $L_{\rm MIR}$. Using these relations, we derive the $L_{\rm MIR}$-based $L_{\rm bol}$ and $M_{\rm BH}$ estimators. We find that our estimators allow the determination of $L_{\rm bol}$ and $M_{\rm BH}$ at an accuracy of $\sim$0.2\,dex against the fiducial estimates based on the optical properties of the unobscured quasars. We apply the $L_{\rm MIR}$-based estimators to SDSS quasars at $z \lesssim 0.5$ including obscured ones. The ratios of $L_{\rm bol}$ from the $L_{\rm MIR}$-based estimators to those from the optical luminosity-based estimators become larger with the amount of the dust extinction, and a non-negligible fraction ($\sim$15\,\%) of the SDSS quasars exhibits ratios greater than 1.5. This result suggests that dust extinction can significantly affect physical parameter derivations even for SDSS quasars, and that dust extinction needs to be carefully taken into account when deriving quasar properties.

 - **Abstract**
 We use high-resolution numerical simulations to follow the barred disk evolution in a suite of models with progressively more massive stellar bulges, with bulge-to-total (disk$+$bulge) mass ratios of $B/T\sim 0-0.25$, embedded in dark matter (DM) halos with the spin $\lambda \sim 0 - 0.09$. We focus on models with a sequence of initial rotational support for bulges, and analyze their spinup and spindown. We find that (1) the presence of a bulge affects the evolution of stellar bars, i.e., the timescale of bar instability, bar pattern speed and its decay, and the vertical buckling instability. The bar strength is nearly independent of $B/T$ in halos with spin $\lambda = 0$, and is suppressed by a factor $\sim 2$ for halos with $\lambda = 0.09$; (2) The main effect of the bulge is the destruction of the harmonic core which affects the buckling; (3) The bulge plays a minor role in the exchange of angular momentum between the barred disk and the DM halo, during its spinup and spindown; (4) Most interestingly, the buckling process triggers different response above/below the disk midplane, which anti-correlates with the bulge mass; (5) In spinning halos, the buckling process has a prolonged amplitude tail, extending by few Gyr, as verified by measuring distortions in the Laplace plane; (6) Furthermore, as verified by orbital spectral analysis, the bulge gains its spin from the bar mainly via the inner Lindblad resonance, while losing it via a number of resonances lying between the outer and inner Lindblad resonance.
