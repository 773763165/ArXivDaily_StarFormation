 - **Abstract**
 There are more than 200 moons in our Solar System, but their relatively small radii make similarly sized extrasolar moons very hard to detect with current instruments. The best exomoon candidates so far are two nearly Neptune-sized bodies orbiting the Jupiter-sized transiting exoplanets Kepler-1625 b and Kepler-1708 b, but their existence has been contested. Here we reanalyse the Hubble and Kepler data used to identify the two exomoon candidates employing nested sampling and Bayesian inference techniques coupled with a fully automated photodynamical transit model. We find that the evidence for the Kepler-1625 b exomoon candidate comes almost entirely from the shallowness of one transit observed with Hubble. We interpret this as a fitting artifact in which a moon transit is used to compensate for the unconstrained stellar limb darkening. We also find much lower statistical evidence for the exomoon candidate around Kepler-1708 b than previously reported. We suggest that visual evidence of the claimed exomoon transits is corrupted by stellar activity in the Kepler light curve. Our injection-retrieval experiments of simulated transits in the original Kepler data reveal false positive rates of 10.9% and 1.6% for Kepler-1625 b and Kepler-1708 b, respectively. Moreover, genuine transit signals of large exomoons would tend to exhibit much higher Bayesian evidence than these two claims. We conclude that neither Kepler-1625 b nor Kepler-1708 b are likely to be orbited by a large exomoon.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite the promise of Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) methods in astronomy, the adaptation of NPE into the routine inference workflow has been slow. We identify three critical issues: the need for custom featurizer networks tailored to the observed data, the inference inexactness, and the under-specification of physical forward models. To address the first two issues, we introduce a new framework and open-source software nbi (Neural Bayesian Inference), which supports both amortized and sequential NPE. First, nbi provides built-in "featurizer" networks with demonstrated efficacy on sequential data, such as light curve and spectra, thus obviating the need for this customization on the user end. Second, we introduce a modified algorithm SNPE-IS, which facilities asymptotically exact inference by using the surrogate posterior under NPE only as a proposal distribution for importance sampling. These features allow nbi to be applied off-the-shelf to astronomical inference problems involving light curves and spectra. We discuss how nbi may serve as an effective alternative to existing methods such as Nested Sampling. Our package is at https://github.com/kmzzhang/nbi.

 - **Abstract**
 The flavor evolution of neutrinos in dense astrophysical sources, such as core-collapse supernovae or compact binary mergers, is non-linear due to the coherent forward scattering of neutrinos among themselves. Recent work in this context has been addressed to figure out whether flavor equipartition could be a generic flavor outcome of fast flavor conversion. We investigate the flavor conversion physics injecting random perturbations in the neutrino field in two simulation setups: 1. a spherically symmetric simulation shell without periodic boundaries, with angular distributions evolving dynamically thanks to non-forward scatterings of neutrinos with the background medium, and neutrino advection; 2. a periodic simulation shell, with angular distributions of neutrinos defined a priori and neutrino advection. We find that, independent of the exact initial flavor configuration and type of perturbations, flavor equipartition is generally achieved in the system with periodic boundaries; in this case, perturbations aid the diffusion of flavor structures to smaller and smaller scales. However, flavor equipartition is not a general outcome in the simulation shell without periodic boundaries, where the inhomogeneities induced perturbing the neutrino field affect the flavor evolution, but do not facilitate the diffusion of flavor waves. This work highlights the importance of the choice of the simulation boundary conditions in the exploration of fast flavor conversion physics.

 - **Abstract**
 AT 2019azh is a H+He tidal disruption event (TDE) with one of the most extensive ultraviolet and optical datasets available to date. We present our photometric and spectroscopic observations of this event starting several weeks before and out to approximately two years after g-band peak brightness and combine them with public photometric data. This extensive dataset robustly reveals a change in the light-curve slope and a bump in the rising light curve of a TDE for the first time, which may indicate more than one dominant emission mechanism contributing to the pre-peak light curve. We further confirm the relation seen in previous TDEs whereby the redder emission peaks later than the bluer emission. The post-peak bolometric light curve of AT 2019azh is better described by an exponential decline than by the canonical t^{-5/3} (and in fact any) power-law decline. We find a possible mid-infrared excess around peak optical luminosity, but cannot determine its origin. In addition, we provide the earliest measurements of the Halpha emission-line evolution and find no significant time delay between the peak of the V-band light curve and that of the Halpha luminosity. These results can be used to constrain future models of TDE line formation and emission mechanisms in general. More pre-peak 1-2 day cadence observations of TDEs are required to determine whether the characteristics observed here are common among TDEs. More importantly, detailed emission models are needed to fully exploit such observations for understanding the emission physics of TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 The unprecedented medium-resolution (R=1500-3500) near- and mid-infrared (1-18um) spectrum provided by JWST for the young (120-160Myr) low-mass (12-20MJup) L-T transition (L7) companion VHS1256b has opened new avenues for the in-depth characterization of substellar object atmospheres. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of this dataset utilizing a forward modelling approach. We explore five distinct atmospheric models, each aiming to encompass diverse physical and chemical phenomena proposed to happen in cool atmospheres in a self-consistent way. Our aim is to assess their performance in estimating key atmospheric parameters: Teff, log(g), [M/H], C/O, gamma, fsed, and R. To achieve this, we apply our Bayesian framework, ForMoSA, employing an optimized nested sampling algorithm for model-data comparison. Our findings reveal that each parameter's estimate is significantly influenced by factors such as the wavelength range considered, the spectral features used, the signal-to-noise ratio, and the model chosen for the fit. The observed parameter dispersion may be attributed to systematic error in the models, resulting from their difficulties in accurately replicating the complex atmospheric structure of VHS1256b, notably the complexity of its clouds and dust distribution. To propagate the impact of these systematic uncertainties on our atmospheric property estimates, we introduce innovative fitting methodologies based on independent fits performed on different spectral windows. We finally derived a Teff consistent with the spectral type of the target, considering its young age, which is confirmed by our estimate of log(g). Despite the exceptional data quality, attaining robust estimates for chemical abundances [M/H] and C/O, often employed as indicators of formation history, remains challenging with estimates dispersed on the entire range explored by the model grids.
#### Gaia DR3 data consistent with a short bar connected to a spiral arm

 - **Abstract**
 We use numerical simulations to model Gaia DR3 data with the aim of constraining the Milky Way bar and spiral structure parameters. We show that both the morphology and the velocity field in Milky Way-like galactic disc models are strong functions of time, changing dramatically over a few tens of Myr. This suggests that by finding a good match to the observed radial velocity field, v_R(x,y), we can constrain the bar-spiral orientation. Incorporating uncertainties into our models is necessary to match the data; most importantly, a heliocentric distance uncertainty above 10-15% distorts the bar's shape and $v_R$ quadrupole pattern morphology, and decreases its apparent angle with respect to the Sun-Galactocentric line. An excellent match to the \Gaia DR3 $v_R(x,y)$ field is found for a simulation with a bar length R_b~3.6 kpc. We argue that the data are consistent with a MW bar as short as ~3 kpc, for moderate strength inner disc spiral structure (A_2/A_0~0.25) or, alternatively, with a bar length up to ~5.2 kpc, provided that spiral arms are quite weak (A_2/A_0~0.1), and is most likely in the process of disconnecting from a spiral arm. We demonstrate that the bar angle and distance uncertainty can similarly affect the match between our models and the data - a smaller bar angle (20 deg instead of 30 deg) requires smaller distance uncertainty (20% instead of 30%) to explain the observations. Fourier components of the face-on density distribution of our models suggest that the MW does not have strong m=1 and/or m=3 spirals inside the solar radius.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological parameters can be measured by comparing peculiar velocities with those predicted from a galaxy density field. Previous work has tested the accuracy of this approach with N-body simulations, but generally on idealised mock galaxy surveys. However, systematic biases may arise solely due to survey selection effects such as flux-limited samples, edge-effects, and complications due to the obscuration of the Galactic plane. In this work, we explore the impact of each of these effects independently and simultaneously, using the semi-analytic models from numerical simulations to generate mock catalogues that mimic the 2M++ density field. We find the reconstruction and analysis methods used for our 2M++ mocks produce a value of fsigma_8 that is biased high by a factor 1.04 \pm 0.01 compared to the true value. Moreover, a cosmic volume matching that of 2M++ has a cosmic variance uncertainty in fsigma_8 of ~5%. The systematic bias is a function of distance: it is unbiased close to the origin but is biased slightly high for distances in the range 100-180 Mpc/h. Correcting for this small bias, we find the linear fsigma_8 = 0.362 \pm 0.023. The predicted peculiar velocities from 2M++ have an error of 170 km/s that slowly increases with distance, exceeding 200 km/s only at distances of 180-200 Mpc/h. Finally, the residual bulk flow speeds found in previous work are shown to be not in conflict with those expected in the LCDM model.

 - **Abstract**
 ``Extremely red quasars'' (ERQs) are a non-radio-selected, intrinsically luminous population of quasars at cosmic noon selected by their extremely red colour from rest-frame UV to mid-IR. ERQs are uniquely associated with exceptionally broad and blueshifted [\ion{O}{III}]\,$\lambda$5007 emission reaching speeds $>$6000\,km\,s$^{-1}$. We obtained laser-guided adaptive optics integral-field spectroscopic observations using Keck/OSIRIS and Gemini/NIFS of a sample of 10 ERQs with bolometric luminosities (10$^{47.0}$\textendash10$^{47.9}$)\,erg\,s$^{-1}$ at $z\sim$~(2.3\textendash3.0). The goal is to measure the sizes and spatially-resolved kinematics of the [\ion{O}{III}]-emitting regions. We study the surface brightness maps and aperture-extracted spectra and model the point-spread functions. We identify signs of merger activities in the continuum emissions. We identify physically distinct [\ion{O}{III}] kinematic components that are bimodal and respectively trace ERQ-driven outflows of velocity dispersion $\gtrsim$250\,km\,s$^{-1}$ and dynamically quiescent interstellar media. We find that the ERQ-driven ionized outflows are typically at $\sim$1\,kpc scales whereas the quiescent ionized gas extend to a few kpc. Compared to other luminous quasars the extremely fast ERQ-driven [\ion{O}{III}] outflows tend to be more compact, supporting the notion that ERQs are in a young stage of quasar/galaxy evolution and represent systems with unique physical conditions beyond orientation differences with other quasar populations. The kinematically quiescent [\ion{O}{III}] emissions in ERQs tend to be spatially-resolved but less extended than in other luminous quasars, which can be explained by global and patchy dust obscuration. The hint of ionization cones suggests some of the obscuration can be partially explained by a patchy torus.

 - **Abstract**
 Convincing evidence of a stochastic gravitational wave background has been found by the NANOGrav collaboration in the 15-Year data set. From this signal, we can evaluate the possibility of its source being from the early universe through the tensor perturbations induced by a massive spin-2 graviton field. We consider a time dependent model of the minimal theory of massive gravity, and find values of the graviton mass, mass cutoff time, and Hubble rate of inflation that amplify the energy spectra of primordial gravitational waves sufficiently to reproduce the signal from the NANOGrav data within 1-3 standard deviation. However, a suppression mechanism for high frequency modes must be introduced to conservatively obey the big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound. While there are regions of the parameter space that reproduces the signal, it remains a challenge to simultaneously respect the BBN and cosmic microwave background (CMB) bounds without making the graviton mass cutoff time too deep into the matter dominated era.
#### The ALMA Survey of 70 μm Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages  (ASHES). X: Hot Gas Reveals Deeply Embedded Star Formation

 - **Abstract**
 Massive infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are considered to host the earliest stages of high-mass star formation. In particular, 70 $\mu$m dark IRDCs are the colder and more quiescent clouds. At a scale of about 5000 au using formaldehyde (H2CO) emission, we investigate the kinetic temperature of dense cores in 12 IRDCs obtained from the pilot ALMA Survey of 70 $\mu$m dark High-mass clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). Compared to 1.3 mm dust continuum and other molecular lines, such as C18O and deuterated species, we find that H2CO is mainly sensitive to low-velocity outflow components rather than to quiescent gas expected in the early phases of star formation. The kinetic temperatures of these components range from 26 to 300 K. The Mach number reaches about 15 with an average value of about 4, suggesting that the velocity distribution of gas traced by H2CO is significantly influenced by a supersonic non-thermal component. In addition, we detect warm line emission from HC3N and OCS in 14 protostellar cores, which requires high excitation temperatures (Eu/k ~ 100 K). These results show that some of the embedded cores in the ASHES fields are in an advanced evolutionary stage, previously unexpected for 70 $\mu$m dark IRDCs.
#### Investigating the dark energy phenomenon in $f(R,L_m)$ cosmological  models with observational constraints

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.03948
 - **Abstract**
 This paper explores the dark energy phenomenon within the context of $f(R,L_m)$ gravity theory. Two specific non-linear $f (R, L_m)$ models are considered: $f(R,L_m)=\frac{R}{2}+L_m^\alpha$ and $f(R,L_m)=\frac{R}{2}+(1+\alpha R)L_m$, where the parameter $\alpha$ is free. Here, we adopt a parametrization form for the Hubble parameter in terms of redshift $z$ as $H(z)=H_0 \left[A(1+z)^3+B+\epsilon \log(1+z)\right]^\frac{1}{2}$, which allows for deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model at both low and high redshifts. We then incorporate the Hubble parameter solution into the Friedmann equations for both models. We employ Bayesian analysis to estimate the constraints on the free parameters $H_0$, $A$, $B$, and $\epsilon$ using the Hubble measurements and the Pantheon dataset. Further, we investigate the evolution of key cosmological quantities, such as the deceleration parameter, energy density, pressure, EoS parameter, and energy conditions. The evolution of the deceleration parameter reveals a significant transition from a decelerating phase to an accelerating phase in the Universe. The EoS parameter exhibits quintessence-like behavior for both non-linear $f (R, L_m)$ models.
#### TOI-4641b: An Aligned Warm Jupiter Orbiting a Bright (V=7.5) Rapidly  Rotating F-star

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of TOI-4641b, a warm Jupiter transiting a rapidly rotating F-type star with a stellar effective temperature of 6560 K. The planet has a radius of 0.73 $R_{Jup}$, a mass smaller than 3.87 $M_{Jup}$ $(3\sigma)$, and a period of 22.09 days. It is orbiting a bright star (V=7.5 mag) on a circular orbit with a radius and mass of 1.73 $R_{\odot}$ and 1.41 $M_{\odot}$. Follow-up ground-based photometry was obtained using the Tierras Observatory. Two transits were also observed with the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES), revealing the star to have a low projected spin-orbit angle ($\lambda$=$1.41^{+0.76}_{-0.76}$ degrees). Such obliquity measurements for stars with warm Jupiters are relatively few, and may shed light on the formation of warm Jupiters. Among the known planets orbiting hot and rapidly-rotating stars, TOI-4641b is one of the longest-period planets to be thoroughly characterized. Unlike hot Jupiters around hot stars which are more often misaligned, the warm Jupiter TOI-4641b is found in a well-aligned orbit. Future exploration of this parameter space can add one more dimension to the star-planet orbital obliquity distribution that has been well-sampled for hot Jupiters.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave observations of binary black holes have revealed unexpected structure in the black hole mass distribution. Previous studies of the mass distribution employ physically-motivated phenomenological models and infer the parameters that directly control the features of the mass distribution that are allowed in their model, associating the constraints on those parameters with their physical motivations. In this work, we take an alternative approach in which we introduce a model parameterizing the underlying stellar and core-collapse physics and obtaining the remnant black hole distribution as a derived byproduct. In doing so, we directly constrain the stellar physics necessary to explain the astrophysical distribution of black hole properties under a given model. We apply this approach to modeling the mapping between stellar core mass and remnant black hole mass, including the effects of mass loss due to the pulsational pair instability supernova (PPISN) process, which has been proposed as an explanation for the observed excess of black holes at $\sim 35 M_\odot$. Placing constraints on the nuclear reaction rates necessary to explain the PPISN parameters, we conclude that the peak observed at $\sim 35 M_\odot$ is highly unlikely to be a signature from the PPISN process. This procedure can be applied to modeling any physical process that underlies the astrophysical mass distribution. Allowing the parameters of the core-remnant mass relationship to evolve with redshift permits correlated and physically reasonable changes in the location, shape, and amplitude of features in the mass function. We find that the current data are consistent with no redshift evolution in the core-remnant mass relationship, but ultimately place only weak constraints on the change of these parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the dynamics of the quintom dark energy model using state-of-the-art cosmological observations. The set of equations has been converted into an autonomous system using suitable transformations of the variables. We have discussed the fixed points of the model and the general phase-space behavior, in particular, in finding the existence of the tracker solutions for this model. The observations suggest that at late times the phantom field should dominate the dark energy sector with an approximately 15% share to the quintessence counterpart, and with both fields tracking the background at early times. A Bayesian model comparison with LambdaCDM has also been done by computing the Bayes factor and a positive preference has been obtained for the quintom model. Although not fully resolved, the Hubble tension can be reduced to 2.6{\sigma} when compared with the value of H0 reported in [1] and to 1.6{\sigma} when compared with that of [2].
#### Restoring cosmological concordance with axion-like early dark energy and  dark matter characterized by a constant equation of state?

 - **Abstract**
 The Hubble tension persists as a challenge in cosmology. Even early dark energy (EDE) models, initially considered the most promising for alleviating the Hubble tension, fall short of addressing the issue without exacerbating other tensions, such as the $S_8$ tension. Considering that a negative dark matter (DM) equation of state (EoS) parameter is conducive to reduce the value of $\sigma_8$ parameter, in this paper, we extend the axion-like EDE model in this paper by replacing the cold dark matter (CDM) with DM characterized by a constant EoS $w_{\rm dm}$ (referred as WDM hereafter). We then impose constraints on this axion-like EDE extension model, along with three other models: the axion-like EDE model, $\Lambda$WDM, and $\Lambda$CDM. These constraints are derived from a comprehensive analysis incorporating data from the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), the Pantheon compilation, as well as a prior on $H_0$ (i.e., $H_0=73.04\pm1.04$, based on the latest local measurement by Riess et al.) and a Gaussianized prior on $S_8$ (i.e., $S_8=0.766\pm0.017$, determined through the joint analysis of KID1000+BOSS+2dLenS). We find that although the new model maintains the ability to alleviate the Hubble tension to $\sim$ 1.4$\sigma$, it still exacerbate the $S_8$ tension to a level similar to that of the axion-like EDE model.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on recent results from our successful and pioneering observational program with ALMA to study emerging ultracom pact HII regions of pre-Planetary Nebulae (pPNe) using mm-wavelength recombination lines (mRRLs) as new optimal tracers. We focus on our study of two poster-child pPNe, namely, M2-9 and CRL618. We reveal the structure and kinematics of the en igmatic inner nebular regions of these objects with an unprecedented angular resolution down to 20-30mas (~15-30AU). For both targets, the ionized central regions are elongated along the main symmetry axis of the large-scale nebulae, consiste nt with bipolar winds, and show notable axial velocity gradients with expansion velocities of up to ~100km/s. The H30a pr ofiles exhibit time variability, reflecting changes in the physical properties and kinematics on scales of a few years. O ur ongoing analysis employs 3D, non-LTE radiative transfer modeling, providing a detailed description of the innermost la yers of these well known pPNe with exceptional clarity.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a systematic search of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) 2-min cadence data for new rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) stars observed during the Cycle 2 phase of its mission. We find seven new roAp stars previously unreported as such and present the analysis of a further 25 roAp stars that are already known. Three of the new stars show multiperiodic pulsations, while all new members are rotationally variable stars, leading to almost 70 per cent (22) of the roAp stars presented being $\alpha^2$ CVn-type variable stars. We show that targeted observations of known chemically peculiar stars are likely to overlook many new roAp stars, and demonstrate that multi-epoch observations are necessary to see pulsational behaviour changes. We find a lack of roAp stars close to the blue edge of the theoretical roAp instability strip, and reaffirm that mode instability is observed more frequently with precise, space-based observations. In addition to the Cycle 2 observations, we analyse TESS data for all known roAp stars. This amounts to 18 further roAp stars observed by TESS. Finally, we list six known roAp stars that TESS is yet to observe. We deduce that the incidence of roAp stars amongst the Ap star population is just 5.5 per cent, raising fundamental questions about the conditions required to excite pulsations in Ap stars. This work, coupled with our previous work on roAp stars in Cycle 1 observations, presents the most comprehensive, homogeneous study of the roAp stars in the TESS nominal mission, with a collection of 112 confirmed roAp stars in total.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze photometric observations of the symbiotic star MWC 560 in B and V bands obtained during the period 1990-2023. We estimate the luminosity and the mass accretion rate of the hot component. We find that the luminosity varies in the range from 200 $L_\odot$ to 3000 $L_\odot$, corresponding to a mass accretion rate in the range $1 \times 10^{-7} - 2 \times 10^{-6} \; M_\odot \; yr^{-1}$ (for a 0.9 $M_\odot$ white dwarf and distance 2217 pc). The optical flickering disappears at mass accretion rate of about $1\times 10^{-6}\; M_\odot \; yr^{-1}$, which sets an upper limit for the short-term variability from accreting white dwarf.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves, detected a century after they were first theorized, are spacetime distortions caused by some of the most cataclysmic events in the universe, including black hole mergers and supernovae. The successful detection of these waves has been made possible by ingenious detectors designed by human experts. Beyond these successful designs, the vast space of experimental configurations remains largely unexplored, offering an exciting territory potentially rich in innovative and unconventional detection strategies. Here, we demonstrate the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to systematically explore this enormous space, revealing novel topologies for gravitational wave (GW) detectors that outperform current next-generation designs under realistic experimental constraints. Our results span a broad range of astrophysical targets, such as black hole and neutron star mergers, supernovae, and primordial GW sources. Moreover, we are able to conceptualize the initially unorthodox discovered designs, emphasizing the potential of using AI algorithms not only in discovering but also in understanding these novel topologies. We've assembled more than 50 superior solutions in a publicly available Gravitational Wave Detector Zoo which could lead to many new surprising techniques. At a bigger picture, our approach is not limited to gravitational wave detectors and can be extended to AI-driven design of experiments across diverse domains of fundamental physics.

 - **Abstract**
 T Pyx is one of the most enigmatic recurrent novae, and it has been proposed as a potential Galactic type-Ia supernova progenitor. Using spatially-resolved data obtained with MUSE, we characterized the geometrical distribution of the material expelled in previous outbursts surrounding the white dwarf progenitor. We used a 3D model for the ejecta to determine the geometric distribution of the extended remnant. We have also calculated the nebular parallax distance ($d = 3.55 \pm 0.77$ kpc) based on the measured velocity and spatial shift of the 2011 bipolar ejecta. These findings confirm previous results, including data from the GAIA mission. The remnant of T Pyx can be described by a two-component model, consisting of a tilted ring at $i = 63.7$ deg, relative to its normal vector and by fast bipolar ejecta perpendicular to the plane of the equatorial ring. We find an upper limit for the bipolar outflow ejected mass in 2011 of the bipolar outflow of $M_{ej,b} < (3.0 \pm 1.0) \times 10^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$, which is lower than previous estimates given in the literature. However, only a detailed physical study of the equatorial component could provide an accurate estimate of the total ejecta of the last outburst, a fundamental step to understand if T Pyx will end its life as a type-Ia supernova.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos are believed to be the most abundant fermions in the Universe, but their masses are unknown, except for being non-zero but much smaller than other fermions. Cosmological relic neutrinos could also have non-zero chemical potentials (or asymmetries). We develop a fast neutrino-involved N-body simulation code to include both neutrino mass and asymmetry effects. Using it, we investigate the neutrino effects on the matter pairwise velocity, which itself is an interesting probe of cosmology. We find that for light-halo ($[10^{11},10^{13}]\ M_\odot$) mean pairwise velocity, in the transition range ($[4,15]\ \mathrm{Mpc}$), the effects of neutrino masses overwhelm the effects of neutrino asymmetries, while in the two-halo-group range ($[25,50]\ \mathrm{Mpc}$), for both light and heavy haloes ($[10^{13},10^{15}]\ M_\odot$), the effects of neutrino asymmetries dominate, making it possible to disentangle the two effects. We provide fitting formulae to quantify the effects of neutrino mass and asymmetry on halo-halo pairwise velocities.

 - **Abstract**
 An explanation is proposed for the appearance of slowly drift shadow bursts in the dynamic spectrum of Jupiter against the background of decameter radio emission with a quasi-harmonic structure. Background radio emission is caused by hot ions with a loss cone type distribution function, which generate ion cyclotron waves due to the effect of double plasma resonance. A flow of hot ions with a distribution function of the Maxwell type is injected into the source region, fills the loss cone of generating ions and interrupts the generation of ion cyclotron waves due to the filling of the loss cone. The condition under which instability breaks down is obtained, and the optimal values of the parameters of the injected ions necessary for the occurrence of bursts in absorption are determined.

 - **Abstract**
 Extremely large telescopes (ELTs) are considered worldwide to be one of the highest priorities in ground-based astronomy. The European Southern Observatory (ESO) is developing an ELT that will have a 39 m main mirror and will be the largest visible and infrared light telescope in the world. The ELT will be equipped with a lineup of cutting-edge instruments, designed to cover a wide range of scientific possibilities. The leap forwards with the ELT can lead to a paradigm shift in our perception of the Universe, much as Galileo's telescope did 400 years ago. We illustrate here the various components of the ELT, including the dome and main structure, the five mirrors, and the telescope systems. We then describe the ELT instrumentation and some of the astronomical topics it will address. We then conclude by examining the synergies with other astronomical facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 PSR J1048$-$5832 (B1046$-$58) is a Vela-like pulsar that has exhibited multiple glitch events. In this study, we analyze the timing data spanning nearly 16 years, acquired from both the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and the Parkes 64 m radio telescope. As a result, a total of five glitches are detected within this dataset. Among them, a previously unknown small glitch is newly found at MJD 56985(9) (November 24, 2014), which is also the smallest glitch recorded from this source so far. The increments of the spin frequency and its first derivative are $\Delta \nu \approx 2.2(3) \times 10^ {-8} $ Hz, and $\Delta \dot{\nu} \approx 3(2) \times 10^ {-15} $ s$^{-2}$, respectively. Significant changes in the integrated mean pulse profile are observed following two of the five glitch events, notably in the radio band. We discuss the influence of glitches on the pulsar's emission properties due to superfluid dynamics accompanied by crustquake, as well as the constraints on the equation of state.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: T CrB (NOVA CrB 1946) is a famous recurrent nova with a recurrence timescale of 80 years. Aims: We aim to estimate the colours, luminosity, and mass-accretion rate for T CrB (NOVA CrB 1946) during and after the superactive state. Methods and Results: We performed and analysed $UBV$ photometry of the recurrent nova T~CrB. For the hot component of T~CrB, we find average dereddened colours of $(U-B)_0 = -0.70 \pm 0.08$ and $(B-V)_0 = 0.23 \pm 0.06$, which correspond to an effective temperature of $9400 \pm 500$~K and an optical luminosity of $40-110~L_\odot$ during the superactive state (2016-2022). After the end of the superactive state, the hot component became significantly redder, $(U-B)_0 \approx -0.3$ and $(B-V)_0 \approx 0.6$ in August 2023, and its luminosity decreased markedly to $20-25$~$L_\odot$ in April-May 2023, and to $8-9~L_\odot$ in August 2023. The total mass accreted during the superactive state from 2014 to 2023 is $\sim 2 \times 10^{-7}$~M$_\odot$. This is a significant fraction of the mass required to cause a thermonuclear runaway (TNR). Overall our results support a model in which a large accretion disc acts as a reservoir with increased accretion rate onto the central white dwarf during disc high states, ultimately leading to a TNR explosion, which now seems to be imminent.
#### Detecting the prompt optical flashes of gamma-ray bursts with small  telescope arrays

 - **Abstract**
 We present an observational approach for the independent detection of the prompt optical emission of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). For this purpose, we explore the potential of the Large Array Survey Telescope (LAST). This array of small optical telescopes can be used to scan a wide region of the sky, and to focus on a smaller field of view with increased sensitivity, as needed. The modularity of the array facilitates dynamic scanning of multiple fields, by shifting telescope pointing directions with high cadence. This can significantly increase the effective sky-coverage of a blind survey on short time scales. For events associated with gamma-ray counterparts, the valuable early-time data can supplement high-energy observations. Regardless of gamma-ray association, detections can potentially be used to explore various phenomena associated with GRBs, such as orphan afterglows; dirty fireballs; and choked jets. We simulate a sample of GRBs and their respective optical signals at early times. After accounting for dynamic cadence, the light curves are given as input to a machine learning classifier, used to identify astrophysical transients. We find that by dedicating half of a LAST array to a blind search, one would expect to discover 7-11 GRBs per year, corresponding to an approximate intrinsic event rate of 0.12 per square degree per year.
