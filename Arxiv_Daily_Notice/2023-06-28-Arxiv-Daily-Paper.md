 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) are a new avenue of observing our Universe. So far, we have seen them in the ~10-100 Hz range, and there are hints that we might soon detect them in the nanohertz regime. Multiple efforts are underway to access GWs across the frequency spectrum; however, parts of the frequency space are currently not covered by any planned or future observatories. Photometric surveys can bridge the microhertz gap in the spectrum between LISA and Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) through relative astrometric measurements. Similar to PTA measurements, these astrometric measurements rely on the correlated spacetime distortions produced by gravitational waves at Earth, which induce coherent, apparent stellar position changes on the sky. To detect microhertz GWs with an imaging survey, a combination of high relative astrometric precision, a large number of observed stars, and a high cadence of exposures are needed. Roman's proposed core community survey, the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (RGBTDS), would have all of these components. RGBTDS would be sensitive to GWs with frequencies ranging from $7.7\times 10^{-8}$ Hz to $5.6\times 10^{-4}$ Hz, which opens up a unique GW observing window for supermassive black hole binaries and their waveform evolution. We note that small changes to the survey could enhance Roman's sensitivity to GWs, making it possible to observe the GW background signal that PTAs have recently hinted at with an SNR $\sim$ 70.
#### A pre-explosion effervescent zone for the circumstellar material in SN  2023ixf

 - **Abstract**
 I present the effervescent zone model to account for the compact dense circumstellar material (CSM) around the progenitor of the core collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 2023ixf. The effervescent zone is composed of bound dense clumps that are lifted by stellar pulsation and envelope convection to distances of tens AUs, and then fall back. The dense clumps provide most of the compact CSM mass and exist alongside the regular (escaping) wind. I crudely estimate that for a compact CSM within ~30 AU that contains ~0.01 Mo, the density of each clump is >3000 times the density of the regular wind at the same radius and that the total volume filling factor of the clumps is several percent. The clumps might cover only a small fraction of the CCSN photosphere in the first days post-explosion, accounting for the lack of strong narrow absorption lines. The long-lived effervescent zone is compatible with no evidence for outbursts in the years prior to SN 2023ixf explosion and the large-amplitude pulsations of its progenitor, and it is an alternative to the CSM scenario of several-years-long high mass loss rate wind.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an overview of the Large Program, ``Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk)'', conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The ubiquitous detections of substructures, particularly rings and gaps, in protoplanetary disks around T Tauri stars raise the possibility that at least some planet formation may have already started during the embedded stages of star formation. In order to address exactly how and when planet formation is initiated, the program focuses on searching for substructures in disks around 12 Class 0 and 7 Class I protostars in nearby ($< $200 pc) star-forming regions through 1.3 mm continuum observations at a resolution of $\sim7$ au (0.04"). The initial results show that the continuum emission, mostly arising from dust disks around the sample protostars, has relatively few distinctive substructures, such as rings and spirals, in marked contrast to Class II disks. The dramatic difference may suggest that substructures quickly develop in disks when the systems evolve from protostars to Class II sources or alternatively that high optical depth of the continuum emission could obscure internal structures. Kinematic information obtained through CO isotopologue lines and other lines reveals the presence of Keplerian disks around protostars, providing us with crucial physical parameters, in particular, the dynamical mass of the central protostars. We describe the background of the eDisk program, the sample selection and their ALMA observations, the data reduction, and also highlight representative first-look results.
#### The short gamma-ray burst population in a quasi-universal jet scenario

 - **Abstract**
 We describe a model of the short gamma-ray burst (SGRB) population under a `quasi-universal jet' scenario in which jets can differ in their on-axis peak prompt emission luminosity $L_c$, but share a universal angular luminosity profile $\ell(\theta_v)=L(\theta_v)/L_c$ as a function of the viewing angle $\theta_v$. The model is fitted, through a Bayesian hierarchical approach inspired by gravitational wave (GW) population analyses, to 3 observed SGRB samples simultaneously: the Fermi/GBM sample of SGRBs with spectral information in the catalogue (367 events); a flux-complete sample of 16 Swift/BAT SGRBs also detected by GBM, with a measured redshift; and a sample of SGRBs with a binary neutron star (BNS) merger counterpart, which only includes GRB~170817A at present. The results favour a narrow jet core with half-opening angle $\theta_c=2.1_{-1.4}^{+2.4}$ deg (90\% credible intervals from our fiducial `full sample' analysis) whose on-axis peak luminosity is distributed as $p(L_c) \propto L_c^{-A}$ with $A=3.2_{-0.4}^{+0.7}$ above a minimum luminosity $L_c^\star = 5_{-2}^{+11}\times 10^{51}$ erg s$^{-1}$. For $\theta_v>\theta_c$, the luminosity scales as a power law $\ell\propto \theta_v^{-\alpha_L}$ with $\alpha_L=4.7_{-1.4}^{+1.2}$, with no evidence for a break. While the model implies an intrinsic `Yonetoku' correlation between $L$ and the peak photon energy $E_p$, its slope is somewhat shallower $E_p\propto L^{0.4\pm 0.2}$ than the apparent one, and the normalization is offset towards larger $E_p$, due to selection effects. The implied local rate density of SGRBs is between about 100 up to several thousands of events per Gpc$^{3}$ yr, in line with the BNS merger rate density inferred from GW observations. Based on the model, we predict 0.2 to 1.3 joint GW+SGRB detections per year by the Advanced GW detector network and Fermi/GBM during the O4 observing run.
