 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we examine the combined effects of dark matter (DM) and rotation on the properties of neutron stars (NSs). We employ a self-interacting dark matter model, motivated by the neutron decay anomaly, within the relativistic mean-field formalism to explore its impact on both static and rotating NSs. The Hartle-Thorne approach is utilized to model rotating NSs, treating the DM interaction strength ($G$) as a free parameter and considering angular velocity ($\Omega$) for rotation. We investigate how DM influences the mass-shedding limit, determined using the Keplerian frequency, and analyze the variations in angular velocity at different DM interaction strengths to assess their effects on NS mass, radius, central energy density, and eccentricity. Our results indicate that while rotation increases mass and radius due to centrifugal forces, DM softens the EOS, reducing these properties, particularly at higher DM fractions. DM also reduces rotational deformation, leading to lower eccentricity compared to DM-free NSs at the same angular velocity. Additionally, we calculate the relative deviations in maximum rotational mass and canonical equatorial radius from their baseline values, finding that high DM fractions combined with low angular velocities result in significant reductions, while low DM fractions with high rotational speeds lead to positive deviations, indicating greater deformation.

 - **Abstract**
 Hazardous asteroid has been one of the concerns for humankind as fallen asteroid on earth could cost a huge impact on the society.Monitoring these objects could help predict future impact events, but such efforts are hindered by the large numbers of objects that pass in the Earth's vicinity. The aim of this project is to use machine learning and deep learning to accurately classify hazardous asteroids. A total of ten methods which consist of five machine learning algorithms and five deep learning models are trained and evaluated to find the suitable model that solves the issue. We experiment on two datasets, one from Kaggle and one we extracted from a web service called NeoWS which is a RESTful web service from NASA that provides information about near earth asteroids, it updates every day. In overall, the model is tested on two datasets with different features to find the most accurate model to perform the classification.

          COmoving Computer Acceleration (COCA): $N$-body simulations in an emulated frame of reference

 - **Abstract**
 $N$-body simulations are computationally expensive, so machine-learning (ML)-based emulation techniques have emerged as a way to increase their speed. Although fast, surrogate models have limited trustworthiness due to potentially substantial emulation errors that current approaches cannot correct for. To alleviate this problem, we introduce COmoving Computer Acceleration (COCA), a hybrid framework interfacing ML with an $N$-body simulator. The correct physical equations of motion are solved in an emulated frame of reference, so that any emulation error is corrected by design. This approach corresponds to solving for the perturbation of particle trajectories around the machine-learnt solution, which is computationally cheaper than obtaining the full solution, yet is guaranteed to converge to the truth as one increases the number of force evaluations. Although applicable to any ML algorithm and $N$-body simulator, this approach is assessed in the particular case of particle-mesh cosmological simulations in a frame of reference predicted by a convolutional neural network, where the time dependence is encoded as an additional input parameter to the network. COCA efficiently reduces emulation errors in particle trajectories, requiring far fewer force evaluations than running the corresponding simulation without ML. We obtain accurate final density and velocity fields for a reduced computational budget. We demonstrate that this method shows robustness when applied to examples outside the range of the training data. When compared to the direct emulation of the Lagrangian displacement field using the same training resources, COCA's ability to correct emulation errors results in more accurate predictions. COCA makes $N$-body simulations cheaper by skipping unnecessary force evaluations, while still solving the correct equations of motion and correcting for emulation errors made by ML.

          An Earth-Mass Planet and a Brown Dwarf in Orbit Around a White Dwarf

 - **Abstract**
 Terrestrial planets born beyond 1-3 AU have been theorized to avoid being engulfed during the red-giant phases of their host stars. Nevertheless, only a few gas-giant planets have been observed around white dwarfs (WDs) -- the end product left behind by a red giant. Here we report on evidence that the lens system that produced the microlensing event KMT-2020-BLG-0414 is composed of a WD orbited by an Earth-mass planet and a brown dwarf (BD) companion, as shown by the non-detection of the lens flux using Keck Adaptive Optics (AO). From microlensing orbital motion constraints, we determine the planet to be a $1.9\pm0.2$ Earth-mass ($M_\oplus$) planet at a physical separation of $2.1\pm0.2$ au from the WD during the event. By considering the system evolutionary history, we determine the BD companion to have a projected separation of 22 au from the WD, and reject an alternative model that places the BD at 0.2 au. Given planetary orbital expansion during the final evolutionary stages of the host star, this Earth-mass planet may have existed in an initial orbit close to 1 au, thereby offering a glimpse into the possible survival of planet Earth in the distant future.

 - **Abstract**
 The Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) receivers and technical papers are cited fewer than once in every six publications. This citation shortage is impeding the development of future (sub)millimetre instruments. In an effort to facilitate the correct citations of ALMA receivers and technical papers, this memo provides a comprehensive list of papers for the scientific community. This list was produced in discussion with the scientific and instrumentalist community, based on a June 2024 survey at the European Southern Observatory workshop on the ALMA Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade, as well as with the ALMA technical staff. We now encourage the community to enhance their already-excellent ALMA science with the appropriate references to ensure future (sub)millimetre instrumentation can keep addressing the key questions about our Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a machine learning search for high-redshift ($5.0 < z < 6.5$) quasars using the combined photometric data from the DESI Imaging Legacy Surveys and the WISE survey. We explore the imputation of missing values for high-redshift quasars, discuss the feature selections, compare different machine learning algorithms, and investigate the selections of class ensemble for the training sample, then we find that the random forest model is very effective in separating the high-redshift quasars from various contaminators. The 11-class random forest model can achieve a precision of $96.43\%$ and a recall of $91.53\%$ for high-redshift quasars for the test set. We demonstrate that the completeness of the high-redshift quasars can reach as high as $82.20\%$. The final catalog consists of 216,949 high-redshift quasar candidates with 476 high probable ones in the entire Legacy Surveys DR9 footprint, and we make the catalog publicly available. Using MUSE and DESI-EDR public spectra, we find that 14 true high-redshift quasars (11 in the training sample) out of 21 candidates are correctly identified for MUSE, and 20 true high-redshift quasars (11 in the training sample) out of 21 candidates are correctly identified for DESI-EDR. Additionally, we estimate photometric redshift for the high-redshift quasar candidates using random forest regression model with a high precision.

 - **Abstract**
 We present multi-wavelength data of SN2020acct, a double-peaked stripped-envelope supernova (SN) in NGC2981 at ~150 Mpc. The two peaks are temporally distinct, with maxima separated by 58 rest-frame days, and a factor of 20 reduction in flux between. The first is luminous (M$_{r}$ = -18.00 $\pm$ 0.02 mag), blue (g - r = 0.27 $\pm$ 0.03 mag), and displays spectroscopic signatures of interaction with hydrogen-free circumstellar material. The second peak is fainter (M$_{r}$ = -17.29 $\pm$ 0.03 mag), and spectroscopically similar to an evolved stripped-envelope SNe, with strong blended forbidden [Ca II] and [O II] features. No other known double-peak SN exhibits a light curve similar to that of SN 2020acct. We find the likelihood of two individual SNe occurring in the same star-forming region within that time to be highly improbable, while an implausibly fine-tuned configuration would be required to produce two SNe from a single binary system. We find that the peculiar properties of SN2020acct match models of pulsational pair instability (PPI), in which the initial peak is produced by collisions of shells of ejected material, shortly followed by a terminal explosion. Pulsations from a star with a 72 M$_{\odot}$ helium core provide an excellent match to the double-peaked light curve. The local galactic environment has a metallicity of 0.4 Z$_{\odot}$, a level where massive single stars are not expected retain enough mass to encounter the PPI. However, late binary mergers or a low-metallicity pocket may allow the required core mass. We measure the rate of SN 2020acct-like events to be $<3.3\times10^{-8}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ at z = 0.07, or <0.1% of the total core-collapse SN rate.

          Primordial black holes from an aborted phase transition

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new mechanism of primordial black hole formation via an aborted phase transition during the early matter-dominated stage of reheating after inflation. In reheating, induced by the decay of a pressureless fluid dominating the Universe at the end of inflation, dubbed as reheaton, the temperature of the radiation bath typically increases, reaching a maximum temperature $T_{\rm max}$, and then decreases. We consider a first-order phase transition induced by the increase of the temperature that is aborted as $T_{\rm max}$ is higher than the critical temperature but not sufficiently high for the bubble nucleation rate to overcome the expansion of the Universe. Although bubbles never fully occupy the space, some may be nucleated and expand until the temperature once again decreases to the critical temperature. We argue that these bubbles shrink and disappear as the temperature drops further, leaving behind macroscopic spherical regions with positive density perturbations. These perturbed regions accrete the surrounding matter (reheatons) and eventually collapse into primordial black holes whose mass continues to grow until the onset of radiation domination. We estimate the abundance of these primordial black holes in terms of the bubble nucleation rate at $T_{\rm max}$, and demonstrate that the abundance can be significantly large from a phenomenological perspective.

 - **Abstract**
 To detect ultra-high-energy neutrinos, experiments such as ARA and RNO-G target the radio emission these particles induce when cascading in the ice, using deep antennas in South Pole or in Greenland. One of the main backgrounds for such signals is the radio emission generated by cosmic-ray showers, either directly in the ice, or in the air and transmitted to the ice, which can both reach the deep antennas. The first detection of cosmic rays with deep antennas would thus validate this detection principle and allow us to calibrate the detectors. FAERIE, the Framework for the simulation of Air shower Emission of Radio for in-Ice Experiments, is a numerical tool that couples both CoREAS and GEANT4 Monte-Carlo codes to simulate the radio emission from cosmic-ray showers deep in the ice. Using this code, we will investigate cosmic-ray radio signatures and the possible implications on the design of a cosmic-ray veto.

 - **Abstract**
 GRANDProto300, the mid-scale prototype of the GRAND experiment, is a planned radio array of 300 antennas over $200\, \rm km^{2}$ that will be deployed in the radio-quiet location of Xiao Dushan (China) by $\sim 2026$. The array will act as a test bench for the GRAND experiment and aim to achieve autonomous radio-detection and reconstructions of very inclined air showers in a large-scale array. GRANDProto300 will detect ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in the energy range $10^{16.5}-10^{18}\, \rm eV$ at a rate comparable to Auger. GRANDProto300 could also contain a ground particle array that would validate the performances of the radio detectors. We discuss the current status of the detector commissioning and the rich science case made possible by GRANDProto300, which covers the study of the Galactic-to-extragalactic transition, fast radio bursts and ultra-high-energy gamma-rays.

 - **Abstract**
 The canonical theory for planet formation in circumstellar disks proposes that planets are grown from initially much smaller seeds. The long-considered alternative theory proposes that giant protoplanets can be formed directly from collapsing fragments of vast spiral arms induced by gravitational instability -- if the disk is gravitationally unstable. For this to be possible, the disk must be massive compared to the central star: a disk-to-star mass ratio of 1/10 is widely held as the rough threshold for triggering gravitational instability, inciting significant non-Keplerian dynamics and generating prominent spiral arms. While estimating disk masses has historically been challenging, the motion of the gas can reveal the presence of gravitational instability through its effect on the disk velocity structure. Here we present kinematic evidence of gravitational instability in the disk around AB Aurigae, using deep observations of 13CO and C18O line emission with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The observed kinematic signals strongly resemble predictions from simulations and analytic modelling. From quantitative comparisons, we infer a disk mass of up to 1/3 the stellar mass enclosed within 1" to 5" on the sky.

          Orbital Architectures of Planet-Hosting Binaries III. Testing Mutual Inclinations of Stellar and Planetary Orbits in Triple-Star Systems

 - **Abstract**
 Transiting planets in multiple-star systems, especially high-order multiples, make up a small fraction of the known planet population but provide unique opportunities to study the environments in which planets would have formed. Planet-hosting binaries have been shown to have an abundance of systems in which the stellar orbit aligns with the orbit of the transiting planet, which could give insights into the planet formation process in such systems. We investigate here if this trend of alignment extends to planet-hosting triple-star systems. We present long-term astrometric monitoring of a novel sample of triple-star systems that host Kepler transiting planets. We measured orbit arcs in 21 systems, including 12 newly identified triples, from a homogeneous analysis of our Keck adaptive optics data and, for some systems, Gaia astrometry. We examine the orbital alignment within the nine most compact systems ($\lesssim500$ au), testing if either (or both) of the stellar orbits align with the edge-on orbits of their transiting planets. Our statistical sample of triple systems shows a tendency toward alignment, especially when assessing the alignment probability using stellar orbital inclinations computed from full orbital fits, but is formally consistent with isotropic orbits. Two-population tests where half of the stellar orbits are described by a planet-hosting-binary-like moderately aligned distribution give the best match when the other half (non-planet-hosting) has a Kozai-like misaligned distribution. Overall, our results suggest that our sample of triple-star planet-hosting systems are not fully coplanar systems and have at most one plane of alignment.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization observations indicate that in the best-fit $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter model of the Universe, the local geometry is consistent with at most a small amount of positive or negative curvature, i.e., $\vert\Omega_K\vert\ll1$. However, whether the geometry is flat ($E^3$), positively curved ($S^3$) or negatively curved ($H^3$), there are many possible topologies. Among the topologies of $S^3$ geometry, the lens spaces $L(p,q)$, where $p$ and $q$ ($p>1$ and $0<q<p$) are positive integers, are quotients of the covering space of $S^3$ (the three-sphere) by ${\mathbb{Z}}_p$, the cyclic group of order $p$. We use the absence of any pair of circles on the CMB sky with matching patterns of temperature fluctuations to establish constraints on $p$ and $q$ as a function of the curvature scale that are considerably stronger than those previously asserted for most values of $p$ and $q$. The smaller the value of $\vert\Omega_K\vert$, i.e., the larger the curvature radius, the larger the maximum allowed value of $p$. For example, if $\vert\Omega_K\vert\simeq 0.05$ then $p\leq 9 $, while if $\vert\Omega_K\vert\simeq 0.02$, $p$ can be as high as 24. Future work will extend these constraints to a wider set of $S^{3}$ topologies.

          The role of non-linear Landau damping for cosmic-ray transport

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first assessment, using hybrid PIC simulations, of the role of non-linear Landau damping in the process of self-generated scattering in a high $\beta$ plasma, conditions appropriate for CR scattering in the halo of the Galaxy. This damping process manifests itself in the form of heating of the background plasma and reduction of the drift speed of CRs that yet remains super-Alfvenic. We also show that the damping leads to an inverse cascade process, consisting of producing non-resonant large scale modes, a novel result with many potential phenomenological implications.

          A Physically Motivated Framework to Compare Merger Timescales of Isolated Low- and High-Mass Galaxy Pairs Across Cosmic Time

 - **Abstract**
 The merger timescales of isolated low-mass pairs ($\rm 10^8<M_*<5\times10^9\,M_{\odot}$) on cosmologically motivated orbits have not yet been studied in detail, though isolated high-mass pairs ($\rm 5\times10^9<M_*<10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$) have been studied extensively. It is common to apply the same separation criteria and expected merger timescales of high-mass pairs to low-mass systems, however, it is unclear if their merger timescales are similar, or if they evolve similarly with redshift. We use the Illustris TNG100 simulation to quantify the merger timescales of isolated low-mass and high-mass major pairs as a function of cosmic time, and explore how different selection criteria impact the mass and redshift dependence of merger timescales. In particular, we present a physically-motivated framework for selecting pairs via a scaled separation criteria, wherein pair separations are scaled by the virial radius of the primary's FoF group halo ($r_{\mathrm{sep}}< 1 R_{vir}$). Applying these scaled separation criteria yields equivalent merger timescales for both mass scales at all redshifts. Alternatively, static physical separation selections applied equivalently to all galaxy pairs at all redshifts leads to a difference in merger rates of up to $\rm \sim 1\, Gyr$ between low- and high-mass pairs, particularly for $\rm r_{sep}<150\, kpc$. As a result, applying the same merger timescales to physical separation-selected pairs will lead to a bias that systematically over-predicts low-mass galaxy merger rates.

          The Wanderer: Charting WASP-77A b's Formation and Migration Using a System-Wide Inventory of Carbon and Oxygen Abundances

 - **Abstract**
 The elemental and isotopic abundances of volatiles like carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen may trace a planet's formation location relative to H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, NH$_3$, and N$_2$ "snowlines", or the distance from the star at which these volatile elements sublimate. By comparing the C/O and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios measured in giant exoplanet atmospheres to complementary measurements of their host stars, we can determine whether the planet inherited stellar abundances from formation inside the volatile snowlines, or non-stellar C/O and $^{13}$C enrichment characteristic of formation beyond the snowlines. To date, there are still only a handful of exoplanet systems where we can make a direct comparison of elemental and isotopic CNO abundances between an exoplanet and its host star. Here, we present a $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C abundance analysis for host star WASP-77A (whose hot Jupiter's $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C abundance was recently measured). We use MARCS stellar atmosphere models and the radiative transfer code TurboSpectrum to generate synthetic stellar spectra for isotopic abundance calculations. We find a $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of $51\pm 6$ for WASP-77A, which is sub-solar ($\sim 91$) but may still indicate $^{13}$C-enrichment in its companion planet WASP-77A b ($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = 26 $\pm$ 16, previously reported). Together with the inventory of carbon and oxygen abundances in both the host and companion planet, these chemical constraints point to WASP-77A b's formation beyond the H$_2$O and CO$_2$ snowlines and provide chemical evidence for the planet's migration to its current location $\sim$0.024 AU from its host star.

 - **Abstract**
 Fortran's prominence in scientific computing requires strategies to ensure both that legacy codes are efficient on high-performance computing systems, and that the language remains attractive for the development of new high-performance codes. Coarray Fortran (CAF), part of the Fortran 2008 standard introduced for parallel programming, facilitates distributed memory parallelism with a syntax familiar to Fortran programmers, simplifying the transition from single-processor to multi-processor coding. This research focuses on innovating and refining a parallel programming methodology that fuses the strengths of Intel Coarray Fortran, Nvidia CUDA Fortran, and OpenMP for distributed memory parallelism, high-speed GPU acceleration and shared memory parallelism respectively. We consider the management of pageable and pinned memory, CPU-GPU affinity in NUMA multiprocessors, and robust compiler interfacing with speed optimisation. We demonstrate our method through its application to a parallelised Poisson solver and compare the methodology, implementation, and scaling performance to that of the Message Passing Interface (MPI), finding CAF offers similar speeds with easier implementation. For new codes, this approach offers a faster route to optimised parallel computing. For legacy codes, it eases the transition to parallel computing, allowing their transformation into scalable, high-performance computing applications without the need for extensive re-design or additional syntax.

 - **Abstract**
 The sum of cosmic neutrino masses can be measured cosmologically, as the sub-eV particles behave as `hot' dark matter whose main effect is to suppress the clustering of matter compared to a universe with the same amount of purely cold dark matter. Current astronomical data provide an upper limit on $\Sigma m_{\nu}$ between 0.07 - 0.12 eV at 95% confidence, depending on the choice of data. This bound assumes that the cosmological model is $\Lambda$CDM, where dark energy is a cosmological constant, the spatial geometry is flat, and the primordial fluctuations follow a pure power-law. Here, we update studies on how the mass limit degrades if we relax these assumptions. To existing data from the Planck satellite we add new gravitational lensing data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, the new Type Ia Supernova sample from the Pantheon+ survey, and baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Dark Energy Spectrosopic Instrument. We find the neutrino mass limit is stable to most model extensions, with such extensions degrading the limit by less than 10%. We find a broadest bound of $\Sigma m_{\nu} < 0.19 ~\rm{eV}$ at 95% confidence for a model with dynamical dark energy, although this scenario is not statistically preferred over the simpler $\Lambda$CDM model.

 - **Abstract**
 Measurements of B-mode polarization in the CMB sourced from primordial gravitational waves would provide information on the energy scale of inflation and its potential form. To achieve these goals, one must carefully characterize the Galactic foregrounds, which can be distinguished from the CMB by conducting measurements at multiple frequencies. BICEP Array is the latest-generation multi-frequency instrument of the BICEP/Keck program, which specifically targets degree-scale primordial B-modes in the CMB. In its final configuration, this telescope will consist of four small-aperture receivers, spanning frequency bands from 30 to 270 GHz. The 220/270 GHz receiver designed to characterize Galactic dust is currently undergoing commissioning at Stanford University and is scheduled to deploy to the South Pole during the 2024--2025 austral summer. Here, we will provide an overview of this high-frequency receiver and discuss the integration status and test results as it is being commissioned.

 - **Abstract**
 This study outlines a detailed investigation using CCD {\it UBV} and {\it Gaia} DR3 data sets of the two open clusters Ruprecht 1 (Rup-1) and Ruprecht 171 (Rup-171). Fundamental astrophysical parameters such as color excesses, photometric metallicities, ages, and isochrone distances were based on {\it UBV}-data analyses, whereas membership probability calculations, structural and astrophysical parameters, as well as the kinematic analyses were based on {\it Gaia} DR3-data. We identified 74 and 596 stars as the most probable cluster members with membership probabilities over 50\% for Rup-1 and Rup-171, respectively. The color excesses $E(B-V)$ were obtained as $0.166\pm0.022$ and $0.301\pm0.027$ mag for Rup-1 and Rup-171, respectively. Photometric metallicity analyses were performed by considering F-G type main-sequence member stars and found to be [Fe/H]=$-0.09\pm 0.16$ and [Fe/H]=$-0.20\pm 0.20$ dex for Rup-1 and Rup-171, respectively. Ages and distances were based on both {\it UBV} and {\it Gaia}-data analyses; according to isochrone-fitting these values were estimated to be $t=580\pm60$ Myr, $d=1469\pm57$ pc for Rup-1 and $t=2700\pm200$ Myr, $d=1509\pm69$ pc for Rup-171. The present-day mass function slope of Rup-1 was estimated as $1.26\pm0.32$ and Rup-171 as $1.53\pm1.49$. Galactic orbit integration analyses showed that both of the clusters might be formed outside the solar circle.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first comprehensive analysis of the internal dynamics of multiple stellar populations (MPs) in 28 Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs) across a wide field of view, extending from the innermost regions to the clusters' outskirts. Using astro-photometric catalogs from ground-based observations, Gaia, and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we identify first- (1P) and second-population (2P) stars, and study the internal dynamics of MPs using high-precision Gaia DR3 and HST proper motions. Our results reveal that while the 1P transitions from isotropy to slight tangential anisotropy toward the outer regions, 2P stars become increasingly radially anisotropic beyond the half-light radius. We also explore the connection between the dynamics of MPs and the clusters' structural and dynamical properties, finding statistically significant differences in the anisotropy profiles of dynamically young and non-relaxed clusters, particularly beyond the 1-2 half-light radii. In these regions, 1P stars transition from isotropic to slightly tangentially anisotropic motion, while 2P stars become more radially anisotropic. In contrast, dynamically older clusters, with mixed MPs, exhibit weaker relative differences. Furthermore, clusters with orbits closer to the Galactic center exhibit larger dynamical differences between 1P and 2P stars than those with larger peri-Galactic radii. These findings are consistent with a scenario where 2P stars form in a more centrally concentrated environment, where the interaction with the Milky Way tidal field plays a crucial role in the dynamical evolution of MPs, especially of 1P.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars in an open cluster are assumed to have formed from a broadly homogeneous distribution of gas, implying that they should be chemically homogeneous. Quantifying the level to which open clusters are chemically homogeneous can therefore tell us about ISM pollution and gas-mixing in progenitor molecular clouds. Using SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper and SDSS-IV APOGEE DR17 abundances, we test this assumption by quantifying intrinsic chemical scatter in up to 20 different chemical abundances across 26 Milky Way open clusters. We find that we can place 3${\sigma}$ upper limits on open cluster homogeneity within 0.02 dex or less in the majority of elements, while for neutron capture elements, as well as those elements having weak lines, we place limits on their homogeneity within 0.2 dex. Finally, we find that giant stars in open clusters are ~0.01 dex more homogeneous than a matched sample of field stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Estimation of the amount of cosmic-ray induced background events is a challenging task for Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). Most approaches rely on a model of the background signal derived from archival observations, which is then normalised to the region of interest (ROI) and respective observation conditions using emission-free regions in the observation.This is, however, disadvantageous for the analysis of large, extended $\gamma$-ray structures, where no sufficient source free region can be found. We aim to address this issue by estimating the normalisation of a 3-dimensional background model template from separate, matched observations of emission-free sky regions. As a result, the need for a emission-free region in the field of view of the observation becomes unnecessary. For this purpose, we implement an algorithm to identify observation pairs with as close as possible observation conditions. The open-source analysis package Gammapy is utilized for estimating the background rate, facilitating seamless adaptation of the framework to many $\gamma$-ray detection facilities. Public data from the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) is employed to validate this methodology. The analysis demonstrates that employing a background rate estimated through this run-matching approach yields results consistent with those obtained using the standard application of the background model template. Furthermore, the compatibility of the source parameters obtained through this approach with previous publications and an analysis employing the background model template approach is confirmed, along with an estimation of the statistical and systematic uncertainties introduced by this method.

 - **Abstract**
 The increasing number of observations towards different environments in the Milky Way, as well as theoretical and experimental works, are improving our knowledge of the astrochemical processes in the interstellar medium (ISM). In this chapter we report some of the main projects to study the chemical complexity and isotopic ratios across the Galaxy. High-sensitivity spectral surveys covering broad bandwidths towards Galactic Center molecular clouds (e.g. G+0.693-0.027) and star-forming regions (e.g. the hot core G31.41+0.31) are revealing very rich astrochemical reservoirs, which include molecules of prebiotic interest. At the same time, isotopic ratios (e.g. $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C and $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N) can give important information on the Galactic chemical evolution, as well as on chemical local processes due to the physical conditions of the molecular clouds. We also highlight the role of cosmic rays as a key agent affecting the interstellar chemistry described above.

 - **Abstract**
 We apply multi-algorithm machine learning models to TESS 2-minute survey data from Sectors 1-72 to identify stellar flares. Models trained with Deep Neural Network, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms, respectively, utilized four flare light curve characteristics as input features. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, all exceeding 94%. Validation against previously reported TESS M dwarf flare identifications showed that our models successfully recovered over 92% of the flares while detecting $\sim2,000$ more small events, thus extending the detection sensitivity of previous work. After processing 1.3 million light curves, our models identified nearly 18,000 flare stars and 250,000 flares. We present an extensive catalog documenting both flare and stellar properties. We find strong correlations in total flare energy and flare amplitude with color, in agreement with previous studies. Flare frequency distributions are analyzed, refining power-law slopes for flare behavior with the frequency uncertainties due to the detection incompleteness of low-amplitude events. We determine rotation periods for $\sim120,000$ stars thus yielding the relationship between rotation period and flare activity. We find that the transition in rotation period between the saturated and unsaturated regimes in flare energy coincides with the same transition in rotation period separating the saturated and unsaturated levels in coronal X-ray emission. We find that X-ray emission increases more rapidly with flare luminosity in earlier-type and unsaturated stars, indicating more efficient coronal heating in these objects. Additionally, we detect flares in white dwarfs and hot subdwarfs that are likely arising from unresolved low-mass companions.

 We make use of model-independent statistical methods to assess the consistency of three different supernova compilations: Union3, Pantheon+ and DES 5-year supernovae. We expand the available model space of each, using Crossing Statistics, and test the compatibility of each dataset, against the other two. This is done using (I) a Flat $\Lambda$CDM fitting to, and (II) Iterative Smoothing from, one particular dataset, and determining the level of deformation by required to fit the other two. This allows us to test the mutual consistency of the datasets both within the standard model and in the case of some extended model, motivated by features present in a particular dataset. We find that, in both these cases, the data are only consistent with the point in the parameter space corresponding to zero deformation, at around a $2\sigma$ level, with the DES compilation showing the largest disagreement. However, all three datasets are still found to be consistent to within $1-2\sigma$ for some subset of the extended model space implied by the deformations.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyses occurrence of DH type II solar radio bursts spanning over solar cycles 23-25 during which a total of 590 DH type II bursts are reported with confirmed 568 and 462 cases of associated CME and flares, respectively. We find short-term yet important differences in DH type II activity when the data is examined in terms of event counts and their durations, e.g., temporal shift in the peak activity during cycle 24 and variation in the growth rate of the activity level during cycle 25. For an in-depth exploration, DH type II bursts are classified in 3 categories based on their end-frequencies: Low-, Medium-, and High- Frequency Groups (LFG, MFG, and HFG, respectively). The HFG category is the most populous (~47 %) while the LFG category occupy about a quarter of the events (~24 %). The LFG events show a clear inclination toward fastest CMEs and X-class flares with a quarter of events exhibiting end frequency below 50 MHz.

          Accurate calibration spectra for precision radial velocities -- Iodine absorption referenced by a laser frequency comb

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomical spectrographs require frequency calibration through sources like hollow-cathode lamps or absorption-gas cells. Laser frequency combs (LFCs) provide highest accuracy but are facing operational challenges. We aim to provide a precise and accurate frequency solution for the spectrum of molecular iodine absorption by referencing to an LFC that does not cover the same frequency range. We used a Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) to produce a consistent frequency scale for the combined spectrum from an iodine absorption cell at 5200--6200Åand an LFC at 8200Å. We used 17,807 comb lines to determine the FTS frequency offset and compared the calibrated iodine spectrum to a synthetic spectrum computed from a molecular potential model. In a single scan, the frequency offset was determined from the comb spectrum with an uncertainty of $\sim$1 cm s$^{-1}$. The distribution of comb line frequencies is consistent with no deviation from linearity. The iodine observation matches the model with an offset of smaller than the model uncertainties of $\sim$1 m s$^{-1}$, which confirms that the FTS zero point is valid outside the range covered by the LFC, and that the frequencies of the iodine absorption model are accurate. We also report small systematic effects regarding the iodine model's energy scale. We conclude that Fourier Transform Spectrometry can transfer LFC accuracy into frequency ranges not originally covered by the comb. This allows us to assign accurate frequency scales to the spectra of customized wavelength calibrators. The calibrators can be optimized for individual spectrograph designs regarding resolution and spectral bandwidth, and requirements on their long-term stability are relaxed because FTS monitoring can be performed during operation. This provides flexibility for the design and operation of calibration sources for high-precision Doppler experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 The Wide Angle Search for Planets (WASP) survey used transit photometry to discover nearly 200 gas-giant exoplanets and derive their planetary and stellar parameters. Reliable determination of the planetary density depends on accurate measurement of the planet's radius, obtained from the transit depth and photodynamical determination of the stellar radius. The stellar density, and hence the stellar radius are typically determined in a model-independent way from the star's reflex orbital acceleration and the transit profile. Additional flux coming from the system due to a bright, undetected stellar binary companion can, however, potentially dilute the transit curve and radial velocity signal, leading to under-estimation of the planet's mass and radius, and to overestimation of the planet's density. In this study, we cross-check the published radii of all the WASP planet host stars, determined from their transit profiles and radial-velocity curves, against radiometric measurements of stellar radii derived from their angular diameters (via the Infrared Flux method) and trigonometric parallaxes. We identify eight systems showing radiometric stellar radii significantly greater than their published photodynamical values: WASPs 20, 85, 86, 103, 105, 129, 144 and 171. We investigate these systems in more detail to establish plausible ranges of angular and radial-velocity separations within which such "stealth binaries" could evade detection, and deduce their likely orbital periods, mass ratios, and flux ratios. After accounting for the dilution of transit depth and radial velocity amplitude, we find that on average, the planetary densities for the identified stealth binary systems should be reduced by a factor of 1.3.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent millimeter and submillimeter observations have unveiled elongated and asymmetric structures around protostars. These structures, referred to as streamers, often exhibit coherent velocity gradients, seemingly indicating a directed gas flow towards the protostars. However, their origin and role in star formation remain uncertain. A protostellar core Per-emb-2, located in Barnard 1, has a relatively large streamer with $10^4$ au, which is more prominent in emission from carbon chain molecules. We aim to unveil the formation mechanism of this streamer. We conducted mapping observations towards Per-emb-2 using the NRO 45-m telescope. We targeted carbon chain molecular lines such as CCS, HC$_3$N, and HC$_5$N. Using astrodendro, we identified one protostellar and four starless cores, including three new detections, on the Herschel map. The starless and protostellar cores are more or less gravitationally bound. We discovered strong CCS and HC$_3$N emissions extending from the north to the south, appearing to bridge the gap between the protostellar core and the starless core north of it. This bridge spans $3\times 10^4$ au with the velocities from 6.5 to 7.0 km s$^{-1}$. The bridge has the velocity gradient opposite to the streamer. Thus, the streamer is unlikely to be connected to this bridge, suggesting that the streamer does not have an accretion origin. We propose that a collision between a spherical core and the filament has shaped the density structure in this region, consequently triggering star formation within the head-tail-shaped core. In this core-filament collision (CFC) scenario, the collision appears to have fragmented the filament into two structures. The streamer is a bow structure, while the bridge is a remnant of the shock-compressed filament. Thus, we conclude that the Per-emb-2 streamer does not significantly contribute to the mass accumulation towards the protostar.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the long-term photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaign of a transitioning SN~IIn/Ibn from $-$10.8 d to 150.7 d post $V$-band maximum. SN~2021foa shows prominent He i lines comparable in strength to the H$\alpha$ line around peak luminosity, placing SN~2021foa between the SN~IIn and SN~Ibn populations. The spectral comparison with SNe~IIn and SNe~Ibn shows that it resembles the SN~IIn population at pre-maximum, becomes intermediate between SNe~IIn/Ibn around maximum light, and similar to SN~1996al at late times. The photometric evolution shows a precursor at $-$50 d and a light curve shoulder around 17 d, which matches well with the light curve of the interacting IIns like SN~2016jbu. The peak luminosity and color evolution of SN 2021foa are consistent with most SNe~IIn and SNe~Ibn. SN~2021foa shows the unique case of a SN~IIn where the P-Cygni features in H$\alpha$ appear at later stages, either due to complex geometry of the CSM or an interaction of the ejecta with a CSM shell/disk (similar to SNe~2009ip and 2015bh). Temporal evolution of the H$\alpha$ profile favours a disk-like CSM geometry (CSM having both H and He) with a narrow (500 -- 1200 km s$^{-1}$) component, intermediate width (3000 -- 8000 km s$^{-1}$) and broad component in absorption. Hydrodynamical lightcurve modelling can well-reproduce the lightcurve by a two-component CSM structure with different densities ($\rho$ $\propto$ r$^{-2}$ -- $\rho$ $\propto$ r$^{-5}$), mass-loss rates (10$^{-3}$ -- 10$^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) assuming a wind velocity of 1000 km s$^{-1}$ and having a CSM mass of 0.18 M$_{\odot}$. The overall evolution supports the fact that indicates that SN~2021foa most likely originated from a LBV star transitioning to a WR star with the mass-loss rate increasing in the period from 5 to 0.5 years before the explosion or it could be due to a binary interaction.

          Horseshoes and spiral waves: capturing the 3D flow induced by a low-mass planet analytically

 - **Abstract**
 The key difficulty faced by 2D models for planet-disc interaction is in appropriately accounting for the impact of the disc's vertical structure on the dynamics. 3D effects are often mimicked via softening of the planet's potential; however, the planet-induced flow and torques often depend strongly on the choice of softening length. We show that for a linear adiabatic flow perturbing a vertically isothermal disc, there is a particular vertical average of the 3D equations of motion which exactly reproduces 2D fluid equations for arbitrary adiabatic index. There is a strong connection here with the Lubow-Pringle 2D mode of the disc. Correspondingly, we find a simple, general prescription for the consistent treatment of planetary potentials embedded within '2D' discs. The flow induced by a low-mass planet involves large-scale excited spiral density waves which transport angular momentum radially away from the planet, and 'horseshoe streamlines' within the co-orbital region. We derive simple linear equations governing the flow which locally capture both effects faithfully simultaneously. We present an accurate co-orbital flow solution allowing for inexpensive future study of corotation torques, and predict the vertical structure of the co-orbital flow and horseshoe region width for different values of adiabatic index, as well as the vertical dependence of the initial shock location. We find strong agreement with the flow computed in 3D numerical simulations, and with 3D one-sided Lindblad torque estimates, which are a factor of 2 to 3 times lower than values from previous 2D simulations.

 We provide a new gravity field of Comet 67P-C/G up to degree 4. We detect mass heterogeneity in the comet nucleus. The loss of mass is restimated at 0.28\% of the comet's total mass (3 times larger than previous estimate). Comparison of the gravity field between pre- and post-perihelion allowed us to measure a shift in the comet's center of gravity of 35 m northward, attributed to ice sublimation process.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite the fact that the $\Lambda$CDM model has been highly successful over the last few decades in providing an accurate fit to a broad range of cosmological and astrophysical observations, different intriguing tensions and anomalies emerged at various statistical levels. Given the fact that the dark energy and the dark matter sectors remain unexplored, the answer to some of the tensions may rely on modifications of these two dark sectors. This manuscript explores the important role of the growth of structure in constraining non-standard cosmologies. In particular, we focus on the interacting dark energy (IDE) scenario, where dark matter and dark energy interact non-gravitationally. We aim to place constraints on the phenomenological parameters of these alternative models, by considering different datasets related to a number of cosmological measurements, to achieve a complementary analysis. A special emphasis is devoted to redshift space distortion measurements (RSD), whose role in constraining beyond the standard paradigm models has not been recently highlighted. These observations indeed have a strong constraining power, rendering all parameters to their $\Lambda$CDM canonical values, and therefore leaving little room for the IDE models explored here.

 - **Abstract**
 In this reply, we present a comprehensive analysis addressing the concerns raised by Dehnen et al. (2024) regarding our recent measurement of the disk warp precession using the `motion-picture' method (Huang et al. 2024). We carefully examine the impact of ignoring the twist of the disk warp and the so-called $R$-$\tau$ correlation on the estimation of the precession rate. The results indicate that the effect is minor and does not exceed the systematic and statistical uncertainties. Using N-body+SPH simulation data, we confirm that the `motion-picture' technique is effective in measuring retrograde precession of disk warp in stellar populations younger than 170 Myr, similar to classical Cepheids. Therefore, the overall conclusions of Huang et al. (2024) remain robust.

 - **Abstract**
 Meteorites and their components exhibit a diverse range of oxygen isotope compositions, and the isotopic exchange timescale between dust grains and ambient gas is a key parameter for understanding the spatiotemporal evolution of the solar nebula. As dust grains existed as macroscopic aggregates in the solar nebula, it is necessary to consider the isotopic exchange timescales for these aggregates. Here, we theoretically estimate the isotope exchange timescales between dust aggregates and ambient vapor. The isotope exchange process between aggregates and ambient vapor is divided into four processes: (i) supply of gas molecules to the aggregate surface, (ii) diffusion of molecules within the aggregate, (iii) isotope exchange on the surface of constituent particles, and (iv) isotope diffusion within the particles. We evaluate these timescales and assess which one becomes the rate-determining step. We reveal that the isotope exchange timescale is approximately the same as that of the constituent particles when the aggregate radius is smaller than the critical value, which is a few centimeters when considering the exchange reaction between amorphous forsterite aggregates and water vapor.

 - **Abstract**
 Phosphorus abundances of ~80 apparently bright sharp-lined early-to-late B-type stars on the upper main sequence are determined by applying the non-LTE analysis to the P II line at 6043.084 A, with an aim of getting information on the P abundance of the galactic gas (from which these young stars were formed) in comparison with the reference solar abundance (A_sun = 5.45). These sample stars turned out to be divided into two distinct groups with respect to their P abundances: (1) chemically peculiar late B-type stars of HgMn group show considerable overabundances of P (supersolar by ~0.5--1.5 dex), the extent of which progressively increases with T_eff. (2) In contrast, the P abundances of normal B-type stars are comparatively homogeneous, though a notable difference is observed between the LTE and non-LTE cases. Although their LTE abundances are near-solar, a slight gradual trend with T_eff is observed. However, after applying the negative non-LTE corrections (amounting ~0.1-0.5 dex), this T_eff-dependence is successfully removed, but the resulting non-LTE abundances (their mean is ~5.20) are appreciably underabundant relative to the Sun by ~0.2--0.3 dex. The cause of this systematic discrepancy (contradicting the galactic chemical evolution) is yet to be investigated.

          A Systematic Survey of Moon-Forming Giant Impacts. II. Rotating bodies

 - **Abstract**
 In the leading theory of lunar formation, known as the giant impact hypothesis, a collision between two planet-size objects resulted in a young Earth surrounded by a circumplanetary debris disk from which the Moon later accreted. The range of giant impacts that could conceivably explain the Earth-Moon system is limited by the set of known physical and geochemical constraints. However, while several distinct Moon-forming impact scenarios have been proposed -- from small, high-velocity impactors to low-velocity mergers between equal-mass objects -- none of these scenarios have been successful at explaining the full set of known constraints, especially without invoking one or more controversial post-impact processes. Allowing for pre-impact rotation of the colliding bodies has been suggested as an avenue which may produce more promising collision outcomes. However, to date, only limited studies of pre-impact rotation have been conducted. Therefore, in the second paper of this series, we focus on pairwise impacts between rotating bodies. Using non-rotating collisions as a baseline, we systematically study the effects of rotation on collision outcomes. We consider nine distinct rotation configurations and a range of rotation rates up to the rotational stability limit. Notably, we identify a population of collisions that can produce low post-impact angular momentum budgets and massive, iron-poor protolunar disks.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe the new design and current performance of the Mid-InfraRed Spectrometer and Imager (MIRSI) on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). The system has been converted from a liquid nitrogen/liquid helium cryogen system to one that uses a closed-cycle cooler, which allows it to be kept on the telescope at operating temperature and available for observing on short notice, requiring less effort by the telescope operators and day crew to maintain operating temperature. Several other enhancements have been completed, including new detector readout electronics, an IRTF-style standard instrument user interface, new stepper motor driver electronics, and an optical camera that views the same field as the mid-IR instrument using a cold dichroic mirror, allowing for guiding and/or simultaneous optical imaging. The instrument performance is presented, both with an engineering-grade array used from 2021-2023, and a science-grade array installed in the fall of 2023. Some sample astronomical results are also shown. The upgraded MIRSI is a facility instrument at the IRTF available to all users.

 - **Abstract**
 We find an analytical solution for the minimal matter density of a void, its central density. It turns out that the voids are not so empty: most of the voids have the central underdensity $\Delta_c \sim -50\%$ (which means that the matter density in their centers is only two times lower than in the Universe on average). For small voids (of radius $R_0\simeq 5-10$~{Mpc}), the underdensity can be significantly greater, but the number of voids decreases rapidly with increasing of $|\Delta_c|$ over $50\%$, and voids with $\Delta_c < -80\%$ are practically absent. The large voids ($R_0\ge 40$~{Mpc}) always have $|\Delta_c| < 50\%$.

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 6334 is a giant molecular cloud complex with elongated filamentary structure, harbouring OB-stars, HII regions and star forming clumps. To study the emission and velocity structure of the gas in the extended NGC 6334 region, we made observations of the 12CO and 13CO (J=3-2) lines with the APEX telescope. The data provides a spatial resolution of 20 arcsec (~0.16 pc) and sensitivity of ~0.4 K at a spectral resolution of 0.25 km/s. Our observations reveal in the extended NGC 6334 region a connected velocity coherent structure of ~-3.9 km/s over ~80 pc parallel to the galactic plane. The NGC 6334 complex has two connected velocity structures at velocities ~ -9.2 km/s (the bridge features) and ~-20 km/s (the Northern Filament, NGC 6334-NF). We observed local velocity fluctuations at smaller spatial scales along the filament tracing local density enhancement and infall. We investigated the 13CO emission and velocity structure around HII regions and found that most HII regions show signs of molecular gas dispersal from the center and intensity enhancement at their outer radii. Overall NGC 6334 exhibits sequential star formation from west to east. Located in the west, the GM-24 region exhibits bubbles within bubbles and is at a relatively evolved stage of star formation. The NGC 6334 central ridge is undergoing global gas infall and exhibits two gas bridge features possibly connected to the cloud-cloud collision scenario of the NGC 6334-NF and the NGC 6334 main gas component. The relatively quiescent eastern filament (EF1 - G352.1) is a hub-filament in formation which shows the kinematic signature of global gas infall onto the filament. Our observations highlight the important role of H II regions in shaping the molecular gas emission and velocity structure as well as the overall evolution of the molecular filaments in NGC 6334.

 - **Abstract**
 Progress in gravitational-wave astronomy depends upon having sensitive detectors with good data quality. Since the end of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA third Observing run in March 2020, detector-characterization efforts have lead to increased sensitivity of the detectors, swifter validation of gravitational-wave candidates and improved tools used for data-quality products. In this article, we discuss these efforts in detail and their impact on our ability to detect and study gravitational-waves. These include the multiple instrumental investigations that led to reduction in transient noise, along with the work to improve software tools used to examine the detectors data-quality. We end with a brief discussion on the role and requirements of detector characterization as the sensitivity of our detectors further improves in the future Observing runs.

 - **Abstract**
 RISTRETTO is a visible high-resolution spectrograph fed by an extreme adaptive optics (AO) system, to be proposed as a visitor instrument on ESO VLT. The main science goal of RISTRETTO is to pioneer the detection and atmospheric characterisation of exoplanets in reflected light, in particular the temperate rocky planet Proxima b. RISTRETTO will be able to measure albedos and detect atmospheric features in a number of exoplanets orbiting nearby stars for the first time. It will do so by combining a high-contrast AO system working at the diffraction limit of the telescope to a high-resolution spectrograph, via a 7-spaxel integral-field unit (IFU) feeding single-mode fibers. Further science cases for RISTRETTO include the study of accreting protoplanets such as PDS70b/c through spectrally-resolved H-alpha emission, and spatially-resolved studies of Solar System objects such as icy moons and the ice giants Uranus and Neptune. The project is in the manufacturing phase for the spectrograph sub-system, and the preliminary design phase for the AO front-end. Specific developments for RISTRETTO include a novel coronagraphic IFU combining a phase-induced amplitude apodizer (PIAA) to a 3D-printed microlens array feeding a bundle of single-mode fibers. It also features an XAO system with a dual wavefront sensor aiming at high robustness and sensitivity, including to pupil fragmentation. RISTRETTO is a pathfinder instrument in view of similar developments at the ELT, in particular the SCAO-IFU mode of ELT-ANDES and the future ELT-PCS instrument.

          Exploring cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds through the synergy of LISA and ET

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational wave (GW) interferometers LISA and ET are expected to be functional in the next decade(s), possibly around the same time. They will operate over different frequency ranges, with similar integrated sensitivities to the amplitude of a stochastic GW background (SGWB). We investigate the synergies between these two detectors, in terms of a multi-band detection of a cosmological SGWB characterised by a large amplitude, and a broad frequency spectrum. By investigating various examples of SGWBs, such as those arising from cosmological phase transition, cosmic string, primordial inflation, we show that LISA and ET operating together will have the opportunity to assess more effectively the characteristics of the GW spectrum produced by the same cosmological source, but at separate frequency scales. Moreover, the two experiments in tandem can be sensitive to features of early universe cosmic expansion before big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), which affects the SGWB frequency profile, and which would not be possible to detect otherwise, since two different frequency ranges correspond to two different pre-BBN (or post-inflationary) epochs. Besides considering the GW spectrum, we additionally undertake a preliminary study of the sensitivity of LISA and ET to soft limits of higher order tensor correlation functions. Given that these experiments operate at different frequency bands, their synergy constitutes an ideal direct probe of squeezed limits of higher order GW correlators, which can not be measured operating with a single instrument only.

          Prospects for Revealing Intermediate-Mass Black Holes in NGC 1399 using SKA

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the detectability of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) within the mass range $10^2-10^5$ solar masses in the globular star clusters of NGC 1399 at a frequency of 300.00 MHz. Employing the theoretical Bondi accretion model and the empirical fundamental plane of black hole accretion, we estimate IMBH masses based on bolometric luminosity and X-ray/radio luminosities, respectively. By simulating a 3-hour observation of 77 globular cluster candidates using the Square Kilometer Array, we identify radio detection benchmarks indicative of accretion onto IMBHs. Our results show that IMBHs inside the globular star clusters located in NGC 1399 are indeed detectable, with the Bondi accretion model providing IMBH mass estimates ranging from $2.93 \times 10^{3.0\pm 0.39}$ to $7.43 \times 10^{4.0 \pm 0.39}$ solar masses, and the empirical fundamental-plane relation suggesting IMBH mass estimation with $3.41\times 10^{5.0 \pm 0.96}$ solar masses. These findings highlight the presence and detectability of IMBHs in globular clusters, offering insights into their role as precursors to supermassive black holes and enriching our understanding of black hole formation and evolution in astrophysical environments.

          21cm Epoch of Reionisation Power Spectrum with Closure Phase using the Murchison Widefield Array

 - **Abstract**
 The radio interferometric closure phases can be a valuable tool for studying cosmological {H\scriptsize{I}}~from the early Universe. Closure phases have the advantage of being immune to element-based gains and associated calibration errors. Thus, calibration and errors therein, which are often sources of systematics limiting standard visibility-based approaches, can be avoided altogether in closure phase analysis. In this work, we present the first results of the closure phase power spectrum of {H\scriptsize{I}}~21-cm fluctuations using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), with $\sim 12$ hours of MWA-phase II observations centered around redshift, $z\approx 6.79$, during the Epoch of Reionisation. On analysing three redundant classes of baselines -- 14~m, 24~m, and 28~m equilateral triads, our estimates of the $2\sigma$ ($95\%$ confidence interval) 21-cm power spectra are $\lesssim (184)^2 pseudo \rm ~mK^2$ at ${k}_{||} = 0.36 $ $pseudo~h {\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ in the EoR1 field for the 14~m baseline triads, and $\lesssim (188)^2 pseudo \rm ~mK^2$ at $k_{||} = 0.18 $ $pseudo~h {\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ in the EoR0 field for the 24~m baseline triads. The ``$pseudo$'' units denote that the length scale and brightness temperature should be interpreted as close approximations. Our best estimates are still 3-4 orders high compared to the fiducial 21-cm power spectrum; however, our approach provides promising estimates of the power spectra even with a small amount of data. These data-limited estimates can be further improved if more datasets are included into the analysis. The evidence for excess noise has a possible origin in baseline-dependent systematics in the MWA data that will require careful baseline-based strategies to mitigate, even in standard visibility-based approaches.
