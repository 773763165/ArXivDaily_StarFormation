#### Is a recently discovered HI cloud near M94 a starless dark matter halo?

 - **Abstract**
 Observations with the Five-Hundred-Meter Aperture Spherical Telescope have revealed the presence of a marginally-resolved source of 21 cm emission from a location $\sim50'$ from the M94 galaxy, without a stellar counterpart down to the surface brightness limit of the DESI Imaging Legacy Survey ($\sim29.15$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in the $g$ band). The system (hereafter Cloud-9) has round column density isocontours and a line width consistent with thermal broadening from gas at $T\sim2\times10^4$ $K$. These properties are unlike those of previously detected dark HI clouds and similar to the expected properties of REionization-Limited-HI Cloud (RELHICs), namely, starless dark matter (DM) halos filled with gas in hydrostatic equilibrium and in thermal equilibrium with the cosmic ultraviolet background. At the distance of M94, $d\sim4.7$ Mpc, we find that Cloud-9 is consistent with being a RELHIC inhabiting a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) DM halo of mass, $M_{200}\sim5\times10^{9}$ $M_{\odot}$, and concentration, $c_{\rm NFW}\sim13$. Although the agreement between the model and observations is good, Cloud-9 appears to be slightly, but systematically, more extended than expected for $\Lambda$CDM RELHICs. This may imply either that Cloud-9 is much closer than implied by its recessional velocity, $v_{\rm CL9}\sim300$ km s$^{-1}$, or that its halo density profile is flatter than NFW, with a DM mass deficit greater than a factor of $10$ at radii $r\lesssim1$ kpc. Further observations may aid in constraining these scenarios better and help elucidate whether Cloud-9 is the first ever observed RELHIC, a cornerstone prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM model on the smallest scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Polaris is the nearest and brightest classical Cepheid, and pulsates with a period of about 4 days. It has long been known as a single-lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 30 yr. Historical photometric and spectroscopic records indicate that, until recently, the pulsation period has been increasing at a rate of about 4.5 s/yr, and that the amplitude of the pulsation declined for most of the 20th century, but more recently halted its decline and began to increase. Here we report an analysis of the more than 3600 individual radial velocity measurements of Polaris available from the literature over the past 126 yr. We find that the pulsation period is now becoming shorter, and that the amplitude of the velocity variations has stopped increasing, and may be getting smaller again. We also find tantalising evidence that these changes in pulsation behaviour over the last century may be related to the binary nature of the system, as they seem to occur near each periastron passage, when the secondary comes within 29 stellar radii of the Cepheid in its eccentric orbit. This suggests the companion may be perturbing the atmosphere of the Cepheid and altering its pulsation properties at each encounter. After removal of the pulsation component of the velocities, we derive a much improved spectroscopic orbit for the binary that should serve as the basis for a more accurate determination of the dynamical masses, which are still rather uncertain.
#### High-resolution Spectroscopic Metallicities of Milky Way Cepheid  Standards and their impact on the Leavitt Law and the Hubble constant

 - **Abstract**
 Milky Way Cepheid variables with accurate {\it Hubble Space Telescope} photometry have been established as standards for primary calibration of the cosmic distance ladder to achieve a percent-level determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$). These 75 Cepheid standards are the fundamental sample for investigation of possible residual systematics in the local $H_0$ determination due to metallicity effects on their period-luminosity relations. We obtained new high-resolution ($R\sim81,000$), high signal-to-noise ($S/N\sim50-150$) multi-epoch spectra of 42 out of 75 Cepheid standards using ESPaDOnS instrument at the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Our spectroscopic metallicity measurements are in good agreement with the literature values with systematic differences up to $0.1$ dex due to different metallicity scales. We homogenized and updated the spectroscopic metallicities of all 75 Milky Way Cepheid standards and derived their multiwavelength ($GVIJHK_s$) period-luminosity-metallicity and period-Wesenheit-metallicity relations using the latest {\it Gaia} parallaxes. The metallicity coefficients of these empirically calibrated relations exhibit large uncertainties due to low statistics and a narrow metallicity range ($\Delta\textrm{[Fe/H]}=0.6$~dex). These metallicity coefficients are up to three times better constrained if we include Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud and range between $-0.21\pm0.07$ and $-0.43\pm0.06$ mag/dex. The updated spectroscopic metallicities of these Milky Way Cepheid standards were used in the Cepheid-Supernovae distance ladder formalism to determine $H_0=72.9~\pm 1.0$\textrm{~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$}, suggesting little variation ($\sim 0.1$ ~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$) in the local $H_0$ measurements due to different Cepheid metallicity scales.
#### Current small-scale CMB constraints to axion-like early dark energy

 - **Abstract**
 The SPT-3G 2018 TT/TE/EE cosmic microwave background (CMB) data set (temperature and polarization) is used to place constraints on an axion-like model of early dark energy (EDE). These data do not favor axion-like EDE and place an upper limit on the maximum fraction of the total energy density $f_{\rm EDE}< 0.172$ (at the 95% confidence level, CL). This is in contrast with ACT DR4 which gives $f_{\rm EDE}=0.150^{+0.050}_{-0.078}$. When combining CMB measurements with measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillations and luminosity distance to Type Ia supernovae, we show that the tension with the S$H_0$ES measurement of the Hubble parameter goes up from 2.6$\sigma$ with Planck to 2.9$\sigma$ with Planck+SPT-3G 2018. The additional inclusion of ACT DR4 data leads to a reduction of the tension to $1.6\sigma$, but the discrepancy between ACT DR4 and Planck+SPT-3G 2018 casts some doubt on the statistical consistency of this joint analysis. The importance of improved measurements of the CMB at both intermediate and small scales (in particular the shape of the damping tail) as well as the interplay between temperature and polarization measurements in constraining EDE are discussed. Upcoming ground-based measurements of the CMB will play a crucial role in determining whether EDE remains a viable model to address the Hubble tension.
#### RR Lyrae stars as probes of the outer Galactic halo: Chemical and  kinematic analysis of a pilot sample

 - **Abstract**
 We report the spectroscopic analysis of 20 halo ab-type RR Lyrae stars with heliocentric distances between 15 and 165 kpc, conducted using medium-resolution spectra from the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle (MIKE) spectrograph. We obtain the systemic line-of-sight velocities of our targets with typical uncertainties of 5-10 km s$^{-1}$, and compute orbital parameters for a subsample out to 50 kpc from the Galactic centre, including proper motion data from Gaia DR3. The orientation of our stars' orbits, determined for an isolated Milky Way and for a model perturbed by the Large Magellanic Cloud, appears to suggest an accreted origin for at least half of the sample. In addition, we derive atmospheric parameters and chemical abundance ratios for seven stars beyond 20 kpc. The derived $\alpha$-abundances of five of these stars follow a Milky Way halo-like trend, while the other two display an underabundance of $\alpha$-elements for their [Fe/H], indicating an association with accretion events. Furthermore, based on the [Sr/Ba] ratio, we can speculate about the conditions for the formation of a potential chemically peculiar carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) RR Lyrae star. By analysing the stars' orbital parameters and abundance ratios, we find hints of association of two of our stars with two massive satellites, namely the Large Magellanic Cloud and Sagittarius. Overall, our results are in line with the suggestion that the accretion of sub-haloes largely contributes to the outer halo stellar populations.
#### Unveiling optical signatures of outflows in accreting white dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 Accreting white dwarfs are known to show signatures of wind-type outflows in the ultraviolet. At optical wavelengths, however, wind detections have only been reported for a few sources. We present GTC-10.4m optical spectroscopy of four accreting white dwarfs (BZ Cam, V751 Cyg, MV Lyr, and V425 Cas) observed during luminous epochs, when their optical emission is expected to be dominated by the accretion disc. We focused the analysis on four emission lines: H$\alpha$ and He I $\lambda$5876, $\lambda$6678, $\lambda$7065. Line profiles are complex and variable on short (minutes) and long (days to weeks) time scales, with transient absorption and emission components. Among them, we detect strong blue-shifted absorptions at $\gtrsim 1000$ km s$^{-1}$. These high-velocity components, present only in the blue wing of the emission lines, are observed in all four sources and could be associated with accretion disc winds. For MV Lyr and V425 Cas, these would represent the first detection of optical outflows in these objects, while in the case of BZ Cam and V751 Cyg, the presence of outflows has been previously reported. This study suggests that, in addition to ultraviolet winds, optical outflows might be also common in accreting white dwarfs. We discuss the observational properties of these winds and their possible similarity to those detected in accreting black holes and neutrons stars.
#### On dataset tensions and signatures of new cosmological physics

 - **Abstract**
 Can new cosmic physics be uncovered through tensions amongst datasets? Tensions in parameter determinations amongst different types of cosmological observation, especially the `Hubble tension' between probes of the expansion rate, have been invoked as possible indicators of new physics, requiring extension of the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm to resolve. Within a fully Bayesian framework, we show that the standard tension metric gives only part of the updating of model probabilities, supplying a data co-dependence term that must be combined with the Bayes factors of individual datasets. This shows that, on its own, a reduction of dataset tension under an extension to $\Lambda$CDM is insufficient to demonstrate that the extended model is favoured. Any analysis that claims evidence for new physics {\it solely} on the basis of alleviating dataset tensions should be considered incomplete and suspect. We describe the implications of our results for the interpretation of the Hubble tension.
#### R2D2: Deep neural network series for near real-time high-dynamic range  imaging in radio astronomy

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel AI approach for high-resolution high-dynamic range synthesis imaging by radio interferometry (RI) in astronomy. R2D2, standing for "{R}esidual-to-{R}esidual {D}NN series for high-{D}ynamic range imaging", is a model-based data-driven approach relying on hybrid deep neural networks (DNNs) and data-consistency updates. Its reconstruction is built as a series of residual images estimated as the outputs of DNNs, each taking the residual dirty image of the previous iteration as an input. The approach can be interpreted as a learned version of a matching pursuit approach, whereby model components are iteratively identified from residual dirty images, and of which CLEAN is a well-known example. We propose two variants of the R2D2 model, built upon two distinctive DNN architectures: a standard U-Net, and a novel unrolled architecture. We demonstrate their use for monochromatic intensity imaging on highly-sensitive observations of the radio galaxy Cygnus~A at S band, from the Very Large Array (VLA). R2D2 is validated against CLEAN and the recent RI algorithms AIRI and uSARA, which respectively inject a learned implicit regularization and an advanced handcrafted sparsity-based regularization into the RI data. With only few terms in its series, the R2D2 model is able to deliver high-precision imaging, significantly superior to CLEAN and matching the precision of AIRI and uSARA. In terms of computational efficiency, R2D2 runs at a fraction of the cost of AIRI and uSARA, and is also faster than CLEAN, opening the door to real-time precision imaging in RI.
#### Thermonuclear explosion criteria for direct and indirect collisions of  CO white dwarfs: a study of the impact-parameter threshold for detonation

 - **Abstract**
 The physical collisions of two white dwarfs (WDs) (i.e. not slow mergers) have been shown to produce type-Ia-like supernovae (SNe) explosions. Most studies of WD-collisions have focused on zero impact-parameter (direct) collisions, which can also be studied in 2D. However, the vast majority of WD collisions arising from any evolutionary channels suggested to date, are expected to be indirect, i.e. have a non-negligible impact parameter upon collision. Here we use the highest resolution 3D simulations to date (making use of the AREPO code), in order to explore both direct and indirect collisions and the conditions in which they give rise to a detonation and the production of a luminous SNe. Using our simulations, we find a detonation criterion that can provide the critical impact parameter for an explosion to occur, depending on the density profile of the colliding WDs, their composition, and their collision velocities. We find that the initial velocity has a significant impact on the amount of 56Ni production from the explosion. Furthermore, the 56Ni production is also strongly dependent on the numerical resolution. While our results from the head-on collision with large initial velocities produce more 56Ni than previous simulations, those with small and comparable velocities produce significantly less 56Ni than previous works.

 - **Abstract**
 High-eccentricity tidal migration predicts the existence of highly eccentric proto-hot Jupiters on the "tidal circularization track," meaning that they might eventually become hot Jupiters, but that their migratory journey remains incomplete. Having experienced moderate amounts of the tidal reprocessing of their orbital elements, proto-hot Jupiters systems can be powerful test-beds for the underlying mechanisms of eccentricity growth. Notably, they may be used for discriminating between variants of high-eccentricity migration, each predicting a distinct evolution of misalignment between the star and the planet's orbit. We constrain the spin-orbit misalignment of the proto-hot Jupiter TOI-3362b with high-precision radial velocity observations using ESPRESSO at VLT. The observations reveal a sky-projected obliquity $\lambda = 1.2_{-2.7}^{+2.8}$ deg and constrain the orbital eccentricity to $e=0.720 \pm 0.016$, making it one of the most eccentric gas giants for which the obliquity has been measured. The large eccentricity and the striking orbit alignment of the planet suggest that ongoing coplanar high-eccentricity migration driven by a distant companion is a likely explanation for the system's architecture. This distant companion would need to reside beyond 5 au at 95% confidence to be compatible with the available radial velocity observations.
#### Metal-THINGS: a panchromatic analysis of the local scaling relationships  of the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 1569

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate several panchromatic scaling relations (SRs) for the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 1569 using IFU data from the Metal-THINGS Survey. Among the spatially resolved properties analyzed, we explore SRs between the stellar mass, SFR, molecular gas, total gas, baryonic mass, gas metallicity, gas fraction, SFE and effective oxygen yields. Such multiwavelength SRs are analyzed at a spatial resolution of 180 pc, by combining our IFU observations with data from the surveys THINGS, CARMA, and archival data from DustPedia. Although we recover several known relations, our slopes are different to previously reported ones. Our star formation main sequence, Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) and molecular KS relations show higher SFRs, lower scatter, and higher correlations, with steeper (1.21), and flatter slopes (0.96, 0.58) respectively. The shape of the SRs including metallicity, stellar mass, and gas fraction are flat, with an average value of 12+log(O/H) $\sim$ 8.12 dex. The baryonic mass vs effective oxygen yields, and the stellar, gas and baryonic mass vs SFE show higher dispersions and lower correlations. Since we use the dust mass as a tracer of gas mass, we derive the Dust-to-Gas Ratio and the CO luminosity-to-molecular gas mass conversion factors, showing differences of 0.16 and 0.95 dex for the total and molecular gas surface density, respectively, in comparison to previously reported values. We use a self regulated feedback model to conclude that stellar feedback plays an important role generating outflows in NGC 1569.

 - **Abstract**
 With neutron star applications in mind, we developed a theory of diffusion in mixtures of superfluid, strongly interacting Fermi liquids. By employing the Landau theory of Fermi liquids, we determined matrices that relate the currents of different particle species, their momentum densities, and the partial entropy currents to each other. Using these results, and applying the quasiclassical kinetic equation for the Bogoliubov excitations, we derived general expressions for the diffusion coefficients, which properly incorporate all the Fermi liquid effects and depend on the momentum transfer rates between different particle species. The developed framework can be used as a starting point for systematic calculations of the diffusion coefficients (as well as other kinetic coefficients) in superfluid Fermi mixtures, particularly, in superfluid neutron stars.
#### Lens mass estimate in the Galactic disk extreme parallax microlensing  event Gaia19dke

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of our analysis of Gaia19dke, an extraordinary microlensing event in the Cygnus constellation that was first spotted by the {\gaia} satellite. This event featured a strong microlensing parallax effect, which resulted in multiple peaks in the light curve. We conducted extensive photometric, spectroscopic, and high-resolution imaging follow-up observations to determine the mass and the nature of the invisible lensing object. Using the Milky Way priors on density and velocity of lenses, we found that the dark lens is likely to be located at a distance of $D_L =(3.05^{+4.10}_{-2.42})$kpc, and has a mass of $M_L =(0.51^{+3.07}_{-0.40}) M_\odot$. Based on its low luminosity and mass, we propose that the lens in Gaia19dke event is an isolated white dwarf.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest flux auto-correlation function has been shown to be sensitive to the mean free path of hydrogen-ionizing photons, $\lambda_{\text{mfp}}$, for simulations at $z \geq 5.4$. Measuring $\lambda_{\text{mfp}}$ at these redshifts will give vital information on the ending of reionization. Here we present the first observational measurements of the Ly$\alpha$ forest flux auto-correlation functions in ten redshift bins from $5.1 \leq z \leq 6.0$. We use a sample of 35 quasar sightlines at $z > 5.7$ from the extended XQR-30 data set, this data has signal-to-noise ratios of $> 20$ per spectral pixel. We carefully account for systematic errors in continuum reconstruction, instrumentation, and contamination by damped Ly$\alpha$ systems. With these measurements, we introduce software tools to generate auto-correlation function measurements from any simulation. For an initial comparison, we show our auto-correlation measurements with simulation models for recently measured $\lambda_{\text{mfp}}$ values and find good agreements. Further work in modeling and understanding the covariance matrices of the data is necessary to get robust measurements of $\lambda_{\text{mfp}}$ from this data.
#### A comparative study of two X2.2 and X9.3 solar flares observed with  HARPS-N: Reconciling Sun-as-a-star spectroscopy and high-spatial resolution  solar observations in the context of the solar-stellar connection

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar flares cannot be spatially resolved, which complicates ascertaining the physical processes behind particular spectral signatures. Due to their proximity to Earth, solar flares can serve as a stepping stone for understanding their stellar counterparts, especially when using a Sun-as-a-star instrument and in combination with spatially resolved observations. We aim to understand the disk-integrated spectral behaviors of a confined X2.2 solar flare and its eruptive X9.3 successor as measured by HARPS-N. The behavior of multiple photospheric and chromospheric spectral lines are investigated by means of activity indices and contrast profiles. A number of different photospheric lines were also investigated by means of equivalent widths, and radial velocity measures, which are then related to physical processes directly observed in high-resolution observations made with the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope and SDO Our findings suggest a relationship between the evolving shapes of contrast profile time and the flare locations, which assists in constraining flare locations in disk-integrated observations. In addition, an upward bias was found in flare statistics based on activity indices derived from the Ca II H & K lines. In this case, much smaller flares cause a similar increase in the activity index as that produced by larger flares. H$\alpha$-based activity indices do not show this bias and are therefore less susceptible to activity jitter. Sodium line profiles show a strongly asymmetric response during flare activity, which is best captured with a newly defined asymmetrical sodium activity index. A strong flare response was detected in Mn I line profiles, which is unexpected and calls for further exploration. Intensity increases in H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and certain spectral windows of AIA before the flare onset suggest their potential use as short-term flare predictors.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Most stars from in groups which with time disperse, building the field population of their host galaxy. In the Milky Way, open clusters have been continuously forming in the disk up to the present time, providing it with stars spanning a broad range of ages and masses. Observations of the details of cluster dissolution are, however, scarce. One of the main difficulties is obtaining a detailed characterisation of the internal cluster kinematics, which requires very high quality proper motions. For open clusters, which are typically loose groups with some tens to hundreds of members, there is the additional difficulty of inferring kinematic structures from sparse and irregular distributions of stars. Aims. Here, we aim to analyse internal stellar kinematics of open clusters, and identify rotation, expansion or contraction patterns. Methods. We use Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) astrometry and Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations to perform vector-field inference and create spatio-kinematic maps of 1237 open clusters. The sample is composed of clusters for which individual stellar memberships were known, thus minimising contamination from field stars in the velocity maps. Projection effects were corrected using EDR3 data complemented with radial velocities from Gaia Data Release 2 and other surveys. Results. We report the detection of rotation patterns in 8 open clusters. Nine additional clusters display possible rotation signs. We also observe 14 expanding clusters, with 15 other objects showing possible expansion patterns. Contraction is evident in two clusters, with one additional cluster presenting a more uncertain detection. In total, 53 clusters are found to display kinematic structures. Within these, elongated spatial distributions suggesting tidal tails are found in 5 clusters. [abridged]

 Wolf 359 (CN Leo, GJ 406, Gaia DR3 3864972938605115520) is a low-mass star in the fifth-closest neighboring system (2.41 pc). Because of its relative youth and proximity, Wolf 359 offers a unique opportunity to study substellar companions around M stars using infrared high-contrast imaging and radial velocity monitoring. We present the results of Ms-band (4.67 $\mu$m) vector vortex coronagraphic imaging using Keck-NIRC2 and add 12 Keck-HIRES velocities and 68 MAROON-X velocities to the radial velocity baseline. Our analysis incorporates these data alongside literature radial velocities from CARMENES, HARPS, and Keck-HIRES to rule out the existence of a close ($a < 10$ AU) stellar or brown dwarf companion and the majority of large gas-giant companions. Our survey does not refute or confirm the long-period radial velocity candidate Wolf 359 b ($P\sim2900$ d) but rules out the candidate's existence as a large gas-giant ($>4 M_{jup}$) assuming an age of younger than 1 Gyr. We discuss the performance of our high-contrast imaging survey to aid future observers using Keck-NIRC2 in conjunction with the vortex coronagraph in the Ms-band and conclude by exploring the direct imaging capabilities with JWST to observe Jupiter-mass and Neptune-mass planets around Wolf 359.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in globular clusters (GCs) raises the possibility of long-term retention of BHs within GCs. These BHs influence various astrophysical processes, including merger-driven gravitational waves and the formation of X-ray binaries. They also impact cluster dynamics by heating and creating low-density cores. Previous N-body models suggested that Palomar 5, a low-density GC with long tidal tails, may contain more than 100 BHs. To test this scenario, we conduct N-body simulations of Palomar 5 with primordial binaries to explore the influence of BHs on binary populations and the stellar mass function. Our results show that primordial binaries have minimal effect on the long-term evolution. In dense clusters with BHs, the fraction of wide binaries with periods >$10^5$ days decreases, and the disruption rate is independent of the initial period distribution. Multi-epoch spectroscopic observations of line-of-sight velocity changes can detect most bright binaries with periods below $10^4$ days, significantly improving velocity dispersion measurements. Four BH-MS binaries in the model with BHs suggests their possible detection through the same observation method. Including primordial binaries leads to a flatter inferred mass function because of spatially unresolved binaries, leading to a better match of the observations than models without binaries, particularly in Palomar 5's inner region. Future observations should focus on the cluster velocity dispersion and binaries with periods of $10^4-10^5$ days in Palomar 5's inner and tail regions to constrain BH existence.

 - **Abstract**
 Broad absorption line (BAL) quasars are characterized by gas clouds that absorb flux at the wavelength of common quasar spectral features, although blueshifted by velocities that can exceed 0.1c. BAL features are interesting as signatures of significant feedback, yet they can also compromise cosmological studies with quasars through their impact on accurate redshifts and measurements of the matter density distribution traced by the Lyman-alpha forest. The presence of BALs can also significantly contaminate the shape of the most prominent quasar emission lines and introduce systematic shifts in quasar redshifts. We present a catalog of BAL quasars discovered in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey Early Data Release, which were observed as part of DESI Survey Validation, as well as the first two months of the main survey. We describe our method to automatically identify BAL quasars in DESI data, the quantities we measure for each BAL, and investigate the completeness and purity of this method with mock DESI observations. We mask the wavelengths of the BAL features and recompute the quasar redshifts, and find the new redshifts differ by 243 km/s on average for the BAL quasar sample. These new, more accurate redshifts are important to obtain the best measurements of quasar clustering, especially at small scales. Finally, we present some spectra of rarer classes of BALs that illustrate the potential of DESI data to identify such populations for further study.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce \texttt{Weakhub}, a novel neutrino microphysics library that provides opacities and kernels beyond conventional interactions used in the literature. This library includes neutrino-matter, neutrino-photon, and neutrino-neutrino interactions, along with corresponding weak and strong corrections. A full kinematics approach is adopted for the calculations of $\beta$-processes, incorporating various weak corrections and medium modifications due to the nuclear equation of state. Calculations of plasma processes, electron neutrino-antineutrino annihilation, and nuclear de-excitation are included. We also present the detailed derivations of weak interactions and the coupling of them to the two-moment based general-relativistic multi-group radiation transport in the \texttt{G}eneral-relativistic \texttt{mu}ltigrid \texttt{nu}merical (\texttt{Gmunu}) code. We compare the neutrino opacity spectra for all interactions and estimate their contributions at hydrodynamical points in core-collapse supernova and binary neutron star postmerger remnant, and predict the effects of improved opacities in comparison to conventional ones for a binary neutron star postmerger at a specific hydrodynamical point. We test the implementation of the conventional set of interactions by comparing it to an open-source neutrino library \texttt{NuLib} in a core-collapse supernova simulation. We demonstrate good agreement with discrepancies of less than $\sim 10\%$ in luminosity for all neutrino species, while also highlighting the reasons contributing to the differences. To compare the advanced interactions to the conventional set in core-collapse supernova modelling, we perform simulations to analyze their impacts on neutrino signatures, hydrodynamical behaviors, and shock dynamics, showing significant deviations.

 Context. The study of planet-crossing asteroids is of both practical and fundamental importance. As they are closer than asteroids in the Main Belt, we have access to a smaller size range, and this population frequently impacts planetary surfaces and can pose a threat to life. Aims. We aim to characterize the compositions of a large corpus of planet-crossing asteroids and to study how these compositions are related to orbital and physical parameters. Methods. We gathered publicly available visible colors of near-Earth objects (NEOs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and SkyMapper surveys. We also computed SDSS-compatible colors from reflectance spectra of the Gaia mission and a compilation of ground-based observations. We determined the taxonomy of each NEO from its colors and studied the distribution of the taxonomic classes and spectral slope against the orbital parameters and diameter. Results. We provide updated photometry for 470 NEOs from the SDSS, and taxonomic classification of 7,401 NEOs. We classify 42 NEOs that are mission-accessible, including six of the seven flyby candidates of the ESA Hera mission. We confirm the perihelion dependance of spectral slope among S-type NEOs, likely related to a rejuvenation mechanism linked with thermal fatigue. We also confirm the clustering of A-type NEOs around 1.5-2 AU, and predict the taxonomic distribution of small asteroids in the NEO source regions in the Main Belt.

 - **Abstract**
 The Rosette Nebula is a young stellar cluster and molecular cloud complex, located at the edge of the southern shell of a middle-aged SNR Monoceros Loop (G205.5+0.5). We revisited the GeV gamma-ray emission towards the Rosette Nebula using more than 13 years of Fermi-LAT data. We tested several spatial models and found that compared to the result using the CO gas template only, the inclusion of the HII gas template can significantly improve the likelihood fit. We performed spectral analysis using the new spatial template. With both the gamma-ray observation and CO+HII gas data, we derived the cosmic ray spectrum of different components in the vicinity of the Rosette Nebula. We found the gamma-ray emissions from Rosette Nebula are substantially harder than previously reported, which may imply that Rosette Nebula is another example of a gamma-ray emitting young massive star cluster.
#### Toward micro-arcsecond-precision astrometry on the innermost wobbling  jet of OJ 287 at 43 GHz: discovery of a mas-scale compact, stable and  7-arcmin-apart reference source

 - **Abstract**
 The BL Lacertae object OJ 287 is a very unusual quasar producing a wobbling radio jet and some double-peaked optical outbursts with a possible period of about 12 yr for more than one century. This variability is widely explained by models of binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) or precessing jet/disk from a single SMBH. To enable an independent and nearly bias-free investigation on these possible scenarios, we explored the feasibility of extremely high-precision differential astrometry on its innermost restless jet at mm-wavelengths. Through re-visiting some existing radio surveys and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) data at frequencies from 1.4 to 15.4 GHz and performing new Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at 43.2 GHz, we find that the radio source J0854$+$1959, 7.1 arcmin apart from OJ 287 and no clearly-seen optical and infrared counterparts, could provide a nearly ideal reference point to track the complicated jet activity of OJ 287. The source J0854$+$1959 has a stable GHz-peaked radio spectrum and shows a jet structure consisting of two discrete, mas-scale-compact and steep-spectrum components and showing no proper motion over about 8 yr. The stable VLBI structure can be interpreted by an episodic, optically thin and one-sided jet. With respect to its 4.1-mJy peak feature at 43.2 GHz, we have achieved an astrometric precision at the state-of-art level, about 10 $\mu$as. These results indicate that future VLBI astrometry on OJ 287 could allow us to accurately locate its jet apex and activity boundary, align its restless jet structure over decades without significant systematic bias, and probe various astrophysical scenarios.

 The open problems related to cosmological tensions in current times have opened new paths to study new probes to constrain cosmological parameters in standard and extended cosmologies, in particular, to determine at a local level the value of the Hubble constant $H_0$, through independent techniques. However, while standard Cosmological Constant Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model has been well constrained and parts of extended cosmology have been intensively studied, the physics behind them aspects restrains our possibilities of selecting the best cosmological model that can show a significant difference from the first model. Therefore, to explore a possible deviation from a such model that can explain the current discrepancy on the $H_0$ value, in this work we consider adding the current local observables, e.g. Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa), $H(z)$ measurements, and Baryon Acoustic Observations (BAO) combined with two new calibrated Quasars (QSO) datasets using ultraviolet, x-ray and optical plane techniques. While these can be identified as part of the high-redshift standard candle objects, the main characteristics of these are based on fluxes distributions calibrated up to $z \sim 7 $. We consider five $H_0$ prior scenarios to develop these calibrations. Furthermore, we found that our estimations provide the possibility to relax the $H_0$ tension at 2$\sigma$ using a QSO ultraviolet sample in combination with late measurements showing higher values of $H_0$. Our results can be an initial start for more serious treatments in the quasars physics from ultraviolet, x-ray, and optical plane techniques behind the local observations as cosmological probes to relax the cosmological tensions problems.

 This contribution describes some recent advances in the parallelization of the generation and processing of radio signals emitted by particle showers in CORSIKA 8. CORSIKA 8 is a Monte Carlo simulation framework for modeling ultra-high energy particle cascades in astroparticle physics. The aspects associated with the generation and processing of radio signals in antennas arrays are reviewed, focusing on the key design opportunities and constraints for deployment of multiple threads on such calculations. The audience is also introduced to Gyges, a lightweight, header-only and flexible multithread self-adaptive scheduler written compliant with C++17 and C++20, which is used to distribute and manage the worker computer threads during the parallel calculations. Finally, performance and scalability measurements are provided and the integration into CORSIKA 8 is commented.

 - **Abstract**
 The binary stellar system $\eta$ Carinae is one of very few established astrophysical hadron accelerators. It seems likely that at least some fraction of the accelerated particles escape from the system. Copious target material for hadronic interactions and associated $\gamma$-ray emission exists on a wide range of spatial scales outside the binary system. This material creates a unique opportunity to trace the propagation of particles into the interstellar medium. Here we analyse $\gamma$-ray data from Fermi-LAT of $\eta$ Carinae and surrounding molecular clouds and investigate the many different scales on which escaping particles may interact and produce $\gamma$-rays. We find that interactions of escaping cosmic rays from $\eta$ Carinae in the wind region and the Homunculus Nebula could produce a significant contribution to the $\gamma$-ray emission associated with the system. Furthermore, we detect excess emission from the surrounding molecular clouds. The derived radial cosmic-ray excess profile is consistent with a steady injection of cosmic rays by a central source. However, this would require a higher flux of escaping cosmic rays from $\eta$ Carinae than provided by our model. Therefore it is likely that additional cosmic ray sources contribute to the hadronic $\gamma$-ray emission from the clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of Sun-as-a-star observations from four different high-resolution, stabilized spectrographs -- HARPS, HARPS-N, EXPRES, and NEID. With simultaneous observations of the Sun from four different instruments, we are able to gain insight into the radial velocity precision and accuracy delivered by each of these instruments and isolate instrumental systematics that differ from true astrophysical signals. With solar observations, we can completely characterize the expected Doppler shift contributed by orbiting Solar System bodies and remove them. This results in a data set with measured velocity variations that purely trace flows on the solar surface. Direct comparisons of the radial velocities measured by each instrument show remarkable agreement with residual intra-day scatter of only 15-30 cm/s. This shows that current ultra-stabilized instruments have broken through to a new level of measurement precision that reveals stellar variability with high fidelity and detail. We end by discussing how radial velocities from different instruments can be combined to provide powerful leverage for testing techniques to mitigate stellar signals.
#### How to make giant planets via pebble accretion

 - **Abstract**
 Planet formation is directly linked to the birthing environment that protoplanetary disks provide. The disk properties determine whether a giant planet will form and how it evolves. The number of exoplanet and disk observations is consistently rising, however, it is not yet possible to directly link these two populations. Therefore, a deep theoretical understanding of how planets form is crucial. We performed numerical simulations of planet formation via pebble and gas accretion, while including migration, in a viscously evolving protoplanetary disk, with dust growing, drifting, and evaporating at the ice lines. In our investigation of the most favorable conditions for giant planet formation, we find that these are high disk masses, early formation, and a large enough disk to host a long-lasting pebble flux. However, small disks with the same mass allow more efficient gas accretion onto planetary cores, leading to more massive gas giants. Given the right conditions, high viscosity leads to more massive cores and it enhances gas accretion. It also causes faster type II migration rates, so the giants have a decreasing final position for increasing viscosity. Intermediate dust fragmentation velocities provide the necessary pebble sizes and radial drift velocities for maximized pebble accretion and pebble flux. An enhanced dust-to-gas ratio can compensate for lower disk masses, but early formation is still crucial. We conclude that there is no specific initial parameter that leads to giant planet formation; rather, it is the outcome of a combination of complementary factors. This also implies that the diversity of the exoplanet systems is the product of the intrinsic diversity of the protoplanetary disks and it is crucial to take advantage of the increasing number and quality of observations to constrain the disk population properties and ultimately devise planet formation theories.

 - **Abstract**
 Some solar-type stars are known to present faint, time-variable radio continuum emission whose nature is not clearly established. We report on Jansky Very Large Array observations of the nearby star $\epsilon$ Eridani at 10.0 and 33.0 GHz. We find that this star has flux density variations on scales down to days, hours and minutes. On 2020 Apr 15 it exhibited a radio pulse at 10.0 GHz with a total duration of about 20 minutes and a peak four times larger than the plateau of 40 $\mu$Jy present in that epoch. We were able to model the time behavior of this radio pulse in terms of the radiation from shocks ramming into the stellar wind. Such shocks can be produced by the wind interaction of violently expanding gas heated suddenly by energetic electrons from a stellar flare, similar to the observed solar flares. Because of the large temperature needed in the working surface to produce the observed emission, this has to be non thermal. It could be gyrosynchrotron or synchrotron emission. Unfortunately, the spectral index or polarization measurements from the radio pulse do not have enough signal-to-noise ratio to determine its nature.

 - **Abstract**
 Although it is well known that the bulk of dark matter (DM) has to be cold, the existence of an additional sub-dominant, hot species remains a valid possibility. In this paper we investigate the potential of the cosmic shear power spectrum to constrain such a mixed (hot plus cold) DM scenario with two additional free parameters, the hot-to-total DM fraction ($f_{\rm hdm}$) and the thermal mass of the hot component ($m_{\rm hdm}$). Running a Bayesian inference analysis for both the Kilo-Degree Survey cosmic shear data (KiDS) as well as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarisation data from Planck, we derive new constraints for the mixed DM scenario. We find a 95 per cent confidence limit of $f_{\rm hdm}<0.08$ for a very hot species of $m_{\rm hdm}\leq20$ eV. This constraint is weakened to $f_{\rm hdm}<0.25$ for $m_{\rm hdm}\leq80$ eV. Scenarios with masses above $m_{\rm hdm}\sim200$ eV remain unconstrained by the data. Next to providing limits, we investigate the potential of mixed DM to address the clustering (or $S_8$) tension between lensing and the CMB. We find a reduction of the 2D ($\Omega_m - S_8$) tension from 2.9$\sigma$ to 1.6$\sigma$ when going from a pure cold DM to a mixed DM scenario. When computing the 1D gaussian tension on $S_8$ the improvement is milder, from 2.4$\sigma$ to 2.0$\sigma$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cryogenic IR echelle Spectrometer (CRIRES) instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) was in operation from 2006 to 2014. Great strides in characterizing the inner regions of protoplanetary disks were made using CRIRES observations in the L- and M-band at this time. The upgraded instrument, CRIRES+, became available in 2021 and covers a larger wavelength range simultaneously. Here we present new CRIRES+ Science Verification data of the binary system S Coronae Australis (S CrA). We aim to characterize the upgraded CRIRES+ instrument for disk studies and provide new insight into the gas in the inner disk of the S CrA N and S systems. We analyze the CRIRES+ data taken in all available L- and M-band settings, providing spectral coverage from 2.9 to 5.5 $\mu$m. We detect emission from $^{12}$CO (v=1-0, v=2-1, and v=3-2), $^{13}$CO (v=1-0), hydrogen recombination lines, OH, and H$_2$O in the S CrA N disk. In the fainter S CrA S system, only the $^{12}$CO v=1-0 and the hydrogen recombination lines are detected. The $^{12}$CO v=1-0 emission in S CrA N and S shows two velocity components, a broad component coming from $\sim$0.1 au in S CrA N and $\sim$0.03 au in S CrA S and a narrow component coming from $\sim$3 au in S CrA N and $\sim$5 au in S CrA S. We fit local thermodynamic equilibrium slab models to the rotation diagrams of the two S CrA N velocity components and find that they have similar column densities ($\sim$1-7$\times$10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$), but that the broad component is coming from a hotter and narrower region. Two filter settings, M4211 and M4368, provide sufficient wavelength coverage for characterizing CO and H$_2$O at $\sim$5 $\mu$m, in particular covering low- and high-$J$ lines. CRIRES+ provides spectral coverage and resolution that are crucial complements to low-resolution observations, such as those with JWST, where multiple velocity components cannot be distinguished.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the effect of asymmetric fermionic dark matter (DM) on the thermal evolution of neutron stars (NSs). No interaction between DM and baryonic matter is assumed, except the gravitational one. Using the two-fluid formalism, we show that DM accumulated in the core of a star pulls inwards the outer baryonic layers of the star, increasing the baryonic density in the NS core. As a result, it significantly affects the star's thermal evolution by triggering an early onset of the direct Urca process and modifying the photon emission from the surface caused by the decrease of the radius. Thus, due to the gravitational pull of DM, the direct Urca process becomes kinematically allowed for stars with lower masses. Based on these results, we discuss the importance of NS observations at different distances from the Galactic center. Since the DM distribution peaks towards the Galactic center, NSs in this region are expected to contain higher DM fractions that could lead to a different cooling behavior.
