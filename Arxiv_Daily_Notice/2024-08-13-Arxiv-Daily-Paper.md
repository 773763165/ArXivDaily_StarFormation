          Constraints on cosmology beyond $\Lambda$CDM with kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich velocity reconstruction

 - **Abstract**
 Kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich velocity reconstruction uses the statistically anisotropic cross-correlation between cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies and a galaxy survey to reconstruct the remotely observed CMB dipole. Using a reconstruction based on data from $\textit{Planck}$ and unWISE, we rule out non-linear Gpc-scale voids, provide the tightest constraint on the intrinsic dipole ($<14 \ {\rm km/s}$ at $68\%$ confidence), rule out matter-radiation isocurvature as an explanation of discrepancies between the measured CMB and galaxy number count dipoles, and constrain the amplitude of local-type primordial non-Gaussianity ($-220\lesssim f_{\rm NL}\lesssim 136$ at $68\%$ confidence) and compensated isocurvature ($-147\lesssim A_{\rm CIP} \lesssim 281$ at $68\%$ confidence). This representative set of constraints on beyond-$\Lambda$CDM scenarios demonstrates the breadth of fundamental science possible with measurements of secondary CMB anisotropies such as the kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect.

 - **Abstract**
 The black hole X-ray binary H1743-322 lies in a region of the Galaxy with high extinction, and therefore it has not been possible to make a dynamical mass measurement. In this paper we make use of a recent model which uses the X-ray reflection spectrum to constrain the ratio of the black hole mass to the source distance. By folding in a reported distance measurement, we are able to estimate the mass of the black hole to be $12\pm2~\text{M}_\odot$ ($1\sigma$ credible interval). We are then able to revise a previous disc continuum fitting estimate of black hole spin $a_*$ (previously relying on a population mass distribution) using our new mass constraint, finding $a_*=0.47\pm0.10$. This work is a proof of principle demonstration of the method, showing it can be used to find the mass of black holes in X-ray binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the influence of a phase transition from hadronic matter to a deconfined quark phase inside a neutron star on its cooling behaviour. We take particular care that all equations of state under investigation are compatible with astrophysical constraints as well as are able to reproduce finite nuclear properties. We find that while the inferred neutrino luminosity of cold transiently-accreting star MXB $1659\text{-}29$ is reproduced in all of the constructed twin star models, the luminosity of colder source SAXJ $1808.4\text{-}3658$ cannot be described by equations of state with quark-hadron transition densities below $1.7$ saturation density, suggesting that twin stars with such low density transitions to the quark phase are not realized in nature. We also discuss how constraints to the quark-hadron phase transition density are strongly dependent on the cooling effectiveness of quark phase reactions.

 - **Abstract**
 Results are presented for the measurement of large-scale anisotropies in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays detected at the Pierre Auger Observatory during 19 years of operation, prior to AugerPrime, the upgrade of the Observatory. The 3D dipole amplitude and direction are reconstructed above $4\,$EeV in four energy bins. Besides the established dipolar anisotropy in right ascension above $8\,$EeV, the Fourier amplitude of the $8$ to $16\,$EeV energy bin is now also above the $5\sigma$ discovery level. No time variation of the dipole moment above $8\,$EeV is found, setting an upper limit to the rate of change of such variations of $0.3\%$ per year at the $95\%$ confidence level. Additionally, the results for the angular power spectrum are shown, demonstrating no other statistically significant multipoles. The results for the equatorial dipole component down to $0.03\,$EeV are presented, using for the first time a data set obtained with a trigger that has been optimized for lower energies. Finally, model predictions are discussed and compared with observations, based on two source emission scenarios obtained in the combined fit of spectrum and composition above $0.6\,$EeV.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cosmic Dawn Survey (DAWN survey) provides multiwavelength (UV/optical to mid-IR) data across the combined 59 deg$^{2}$ of the Euclid Deep and Auxiliary fields (EDFs and EAFs). Here, the first public data release (DR1) from the DAWN survey is presented. DR1 catalogues are made available for a subset of the full DAWN survey that consists of two Euclid Deep fields: Euclid Deep Field North (EDF-N) and Euclid Deep Field Fornax (EDF-F). The DAWN survey DR1 catalogues do not include $Euclid$ data as they are not yet public for these fields. Nonetheless, each field has been covered by the ongoing Hawaii Twenty Square Degree Survey (H20), which includes imaging from CFHT MegaCam in the new $u$ filter and from Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) in the $griz$ filters. Each field is further covered by $Spitzer$/IRAC 3.6-4.5$\mu$m imaging spanning 10 deg$^{2}$ and reaching $\sim$25 mag AB (5$\sigma$). All present H20 imaging and all publicly available imaging from the aforementioned facilities are combined with the deep $Spitzer$/IRAC data to create source catalogues spanning a total area of 16.87 deg$^{2}$ in EDF-N and 2.85 deg$^{2}$ in EDF-F for this first release. Photometry is measured using The Farmer, a well-validated model-based photometry code. Photometric redshifts and stellar masses are computed using two independent codes for modeling spectral energy distributions: EAZY and LePhare. Photometric redshifts show good agreement with spectroscopic redshifts ($\sigma_{\rm NMAD} \sim 0.5, \eta < 8\%$ at $i < 25$). Number counts, photometric redshifts, and stellar masses are further validated in comparison to the COSMOS2020 catalogue. The DAWN survey DR1 catalogues are designed to be of immediate use in these two EDFs and will be continuously updated. Future data releases will provide catalogues of all EDFs and EAFs and include $Euclid$ data.

          Spin-Orbit Alignment of Early-type Astrometric Binaries and the Origin of Slow Rotators

 - **Abstract**
 The spin-orbit alignment of binary stars traces their formation and accretion history. Previous studies of spin-orbit alignment have been limited to small samples, slowly rotating solar-type stars, and/or wide visual binaries that not surprisingly manifest random spin-orbit orientations. We analyze 917 Gaia astrometric binaries across periods $P$ = 100-3,000 days ($a$ = 0.5-5 au) that have B8-F1 IV/V primaries ($M_1$ = 1.5-3 M$_{\odot}$) and measured projected rotational velocities $v$sin$i$. The primary stars in face-on orbits exhibit substantially smaller $v$sin$i$ compared to those in edge-on orbits at the 6$\sigma$ level, demonstrating significant spin-orbit alignment. The primaries in our astrometric binaries are rotating more slowly than their single-star or wide-binary counterparts and therefore comprise the slow-rotator population in the observed bimodal rotational velocity distribution of early-type stars. We discuss formation models of close binaries where some of the disk angular momentum is transferred to the orbit and/or secondary spin, quenching angular momentum flow to the primary spin. The primaries in astrometric binaries with small mass ratios $q$ = $M_2$/$M_1<$0.3 possess even smaller $v$sin$i$, consistent with model predictions. Meanwhile, astrometric binaries with large eccentricities $e>$0.4 do not display spin-orbit alignment or spin reduction. Using a Monte Carlo technique, we measure a spin-orbit alignment fraction of $F_{\rm align}$ = 75% $\pm$ 5% and an average spin reduction factor of $\langle S_{\rm align} \rangle$ = 0.43 $\pm$ 0.04. We conclude that 75% of close A-type binaries likely experienced circumbinary disk accretion and probably formed via disk fragmentation and inward disk migration. The remaining 25%, mostly those with $e>$0.4, likely formed via core fragmentation and orbital decay via dynamical friction.

          Statistics of Solar White-Light Flares I: Optimization of Identification Methods and Application

 - **Abstract**
 White-light flares (WLFs) are energetic activity in stellar atmosphere. However, the observed solar WLF is relatively rare compared to stellar WLFs or solar flares observed at other wavelengths, limiting our further understanding solar/stellar WLFs through statistical studies. By analyzing flare observations from the \emph{Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)}, here we improve WLF identification methods for obtaining more solar WLFs and their accurate light curves from two aspects: 1) imposing constraints defined by the typical temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of WLF-induced signals; 2) setting the intrinsic threshold for each pixel in the flare ribbon region according to its inherent background fluctuation rather than a fixed threshold for the whole region. Applying the optimized method to 90 flares (30 C-class ones, 30 M-class ones, and 30 X-class ones) for a statistical study, we identified a total of 9 C-class WLFs, 18 M-class WLFs, and 28 X-class WLFs. The WLF identification rate of C-class flares reported here reaches 30\%, which is the highest to date to our best knowledge. It is also revealed that in each GOES energy level, the proportion of WLFs is higher in confined flares than that in eruptive flares. Moreover, a power-law relation is found between the WLF energy (\emph{E}) and duration ($\tau$): $\tau \propto {E}^{0.22}$, similar to those of solar hard/soft X-ray flares and other stellar WLFs. These results indicate that we could recognize more solar WLFs through optimizing the identification method, which will lay a base for future statistical and comparison study of solar and stellar WLFs.

          Assembly History and Internal Structure of Cluster Cold Dark Matter Haloes

 - **Abstract**
 We use the Phoenix simulations to study the mass assembly history and internal structures of cluster dark matter haloes ($M_{200} \gtrsim 5\times 10^{14} h^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot$). We confirm that cluster haloes grow inside-out, similar to galactic haloes. Major merger events dominate the growth of the internal region and minor mergers/diffuse accretion shape the outskirts. However, compared to galactic haloes, cluster haloes tend to have a younger and more actively evolving inner region. On average, the majority of mass (> 80%) in the inner region ($R< 0.1 r_{200}$) of Phoenix haloes is accreted after $z = 3$, while for galactic haloes, most mass in the central region has already been accreted before $z=6$. The density profiles of cluster haloes are less stable than those of galactic haloes over different radii. The enclosed mass within $50$ or $150$ kpc of all Phoenix haloes evolves substantially in the past ${\sim} 7$ Gyr, while galactic haloes remained stable during the same period. We suggest that the relatively younger and more active state explains the various observations of cluster haloes, especially in central regions.

          Differential image motion in astrometric observations with very large seeing-limited telescopes

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how to quantitatively model the observed differential image motion (DIM) in relative astrometric observations. As a test bed we used differential astrometric observations from the FORS2 camera of the Very Large Telescope (VLT) obtained during 2010-2019 under several programs of observations of southern brown dwarfs. The measured image motion was compared to models that decompose atmospheric turbulence in frequency space and translate the vertical turbulence profile into DIM amplitude. This approach accounts for the spatial filtering by the telescope's entrance pupil and the observation parameters (field size, zenith angle, reference star brightness and distribution, and exposure time), and it aggregates that information into a newly defined metric integral term. We demonstrate excellent agreement (within 1%) between the model parameters derived from the DIM variance and determined by the observations. For a 30s exposure of a typical 1 arcmin-radius field close to the Galactic plane, image motion limits astrometric precision to ~60 mu-as when sixth-order transformation polynomial is applicable. We confirm that the measured image motion variance is well described by Kolmogorov-type turbulence with exponent 11/3 dependence on the field size at effective altitudes of 16-18~km, where the best part of the DIM is generated. Extrapolation to observations with extremely large telescopes enables the estimation of the astrometric precision limit for seeing-limited observations of ~5 mu-as, which has a variety of exciting scientific applications.

          Free Streaming in Warm Wave Dark Matter

 - **Abstract**
 We provide a framework for numerically computing the effects of free-streaming in scalar fields produced after inflation. First, we provide a detailed prescription for setting up initial conditions in the field. This prescription allows us to specify the power spectra of the fields (peaked on subhorizon length scales and without a homogeneous field mode), and importantly, also correctly reproduces the behaviour of density perturbations on large length scales consistent with superhorizon adiabatic perturbations. We then evolve the fields using a spatially inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equation, including the effects of expansion and radiation-sourced metric perturbations. We show how gravity enhances, and how free streaming erases the initially adiabatic density perturbations of the field, revealing more of the underlying, non-evolving, white-noise isocurvature density contrast. Furthermore, we explore the effect of non-gravitational self-interactions of the field, including oscillon formation, on the suppression dynamics. As part of this paper, we make our code, ${\sf{Cosmic-Fields-Lite}}$ (${\sf{CFL}}$), publicly available. For observationally accessible signatures, our work is particularly relevant for structure formation in light/ultralight dark matter fields.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot and warm Jupiters might have undergone the same formation and evolution path, but the two populations exhibit different distributions of orbital parameters, challenging our understanding on their actual origin. The present work, which is the results of our warm Jupiters survey carried out with the CHIRON spectrograph within the KESPRINT collaboration, aims to address this challenge by studying two planets that could help bridge the gap between the two populations. We report the confirmation and mass determination of a hot Jupiter (orbital period shorter than 10 days), TOI-2420\,b, and a warm Jupiter, TOI-2485\,b. We performed a joint analysis using a wide variety of spectral and photometric data in order to characterize these planetary systems. We found that TOI-2420\,b has an orbital period of P$_{\rm b}$=5.8 days, a mass of M$_{\rm b}$=0.9 M$_{\rm J}$ and a radius of R$_{\rm b}$=1.3 R$_{\rm J}$, with a planetary density of 0.477 \gc; while TOI-2485\,b has an orbital period of P$_{\rm b}$=11.2 days, a mass of M$_{\rm b}$=2.4 M$_{\rm J}$ and a radius of R$_{\rm b}$=1.1 R$_{\rm J}$ with density 2.36 \gc. With current parameters, the migration history for TOI-2420\,b and TOI-2485\,b is unclear: the high-eccentricity migration scenarios cannot be ruled out, and TOI-2485\,b's characteristics may rather support this scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impacts of nuclear burning on the spherically symmetric stationary accretion flow of helium-rich matter on to compact objects. We have already shown the existence of the critical accretion rates for the accretion of CO-rich matter above which the flow truncates in the supersonic region due to nuclear burning in the previous paper \citep{2022ApJ...933...29N}. Here, we show that there are also critical accretion rates for helium-rich matter. While we used empirical formulae for the energy generation rates for carbon burning and oxygen burning without solving the nuclear reaction network in our previous work, we solve a simple nuclear reaction network consisting of 13 elements from $^4$He to $^{56}$Ni to investigate influence of the energy generation from not only triple-$\alpha$ reactions but also the subsequent reactions of synthesized elements. We have also qualitatively confirmed the previous results for CO-rich matter accretion using the revised code with the nuclear reaction network and reported some new findings.

          Prospects of FRBs and Large Scale 21 cm Power Spectra in Constraining the Epoch of Reionization

 - **Abstract**
 The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is a crucial link to grasp the complete evolutionary history of the universe. Several attempts with a variety of observables have been utilized in the past to understand the thermal and ionization evolution of the Intergalactic Medium during EoR. In this study, we explore the simultaneous prospects of two important observables which are expected to be available in the near future, i.e. Dispersion Measure (DM) of high redshift FRBs and large scale 21 cm power spectra. For this purpose, we use an earlier developed explicitly photon conserving semi numerical model, $\texttt{SCRIPT}$ including realistic recombination and radiative feedback effect. We check that DM evolution of 100 mock FRBs at high redshifts ($7.0\le z\le15.0$) is sufficient to recover the underlying reionization model, while 1000 FRB mocks at redshift range can constrain the reionization timeline within the percentage level uncertainties at 68\% confidence limit. Further, we study the effect of including large scale 21~cm power spectra (using only a single bin, $k\sim0.14~h/\mathrm{cMpc}$) at three redshifts along with FRB DM distribution. The joint exploration using these two observables can significantly improve the constraints on the various parameters ($\lesssim 8\%$ uncertainties for reionization interval and midpoint at 95\% confidence) alleviating the degeneracies and can narrow down the thermal history of the universe by discarding some of the extreme heating models.

 - **Abstract**
 The diversity of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) has become increasingly apparent with the rapid growth in observational data. Understanding the explosion mechanism of SNe Ia is crucial for their cosmological calibration and for advancing our knowledge of stellar physics. The estimation of $^{56}$Ni mass produced in these events is key to elucidating their explosion mechanism. This study compares two methods of $^{56}$Ni mass estimation. We first examine the relationship between peak luminosity and the second maximum in near-infrared (NIR) bands using observations of 18 nearby SNe Ia. Based on this relationship, we estimate the Ni mass for a set of nine well-observed SNe Ia using the Arnett rule. Additionally, we estimate the $^{56}$Ni mass using bolometric light curves of these SNe through energy conservation arguments. A comparison of these two estimation methods using Student's t-test reveals no statistically significant differences between the estimates. This finding suggests that both methods provide robust estimates of Ni mass in SNe Ia.

While transporting raw materials from Earth can be costly and time-consuming, in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) presents an attractive alternative. This review paper aims to provide a thorough examination of the current state and future potential of Lunar-based manufacturing and construction (LBMC), with a particular focus on the prospect of utilizing in-situ resources and additive manufacturing. The paper analyzes existing research on LBMC from various perspectives, including different manufacturing techniques and compositions, the potential of ISRU for LBMC, characterization of built parts and structures, the role of energy sources and efficiency, the impact of low-gravity and vacuum conditions, and the feasibility of using artificial intelligence, automation, and robotics. By synthesizing these findings, this review offers valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for LBMC.

 - **Abstract**
 Cygnus X-1 is a high mass X-ray binary where accretion onto the black hole is mediated by the stellar wind from the blue supergiant companion star HDE 226868. Depending on the position of the black hole along the orbit, X-ray observations can probe different layers of the stellar wind. Deeper wind layers can be investigated at superior conjunction (i.e. null orbital phases). We aim at characterising the stellar wind in the Cyg X-1/HDE 226868 system analysing one passage at superior conjunction covered by XMM-Newton during the CHOCBOX campaign via modelling of colour-colour diagrams. Since X-ray absorption is energy-dependent, colour indices provide information on the parameters of the stellar wind, such as the column density $N_{H,w}$ and the covering factor $f_c$. We fitted colour-colour diagrams with models that include both a continuum and a stellar wind component. We used the KDE method to infer the unknown probability distribution of the data points in the colour-colour diagram, and selected the model corresponding to the highest likelihood. In order to study the temporal evolution of the wind around superior conjunction, we extracted and fitted time-resolved colour-colour diagrams. We found that the model that best describes the shape of the colour-colour diagram of Cyg X-1 at superior conjunction requires the wind to be partially ionised. The shape of the colour-colour diagram strongly varies during the analysed observation, as due to concurrent changes of the mean $N_{H,w}$ and the $f_c$ of the wind. Our results suggest the existence of a linear scaling between the rapid variability amplitude of $N_{H,w}$ (on time scales between 10 s and 11 ks) and its long term variations (on time scales 11>ks). Using the inferred best-fit values, we estimated the stellar mass loss rate to be $\sim 7\times10^{-6} {\rm M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$ and the clumps to have a mass of $\sim10^{17}$ g.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents results from Kepler photometric light curves and high-resolution spectroscopic study of a super Li-rich giant KIC11087027. Using the light curve analysis, we measured the star's rotational period P$_{\rm rot}$=30.4$\pm$0.1~days, which translates to rotational velocity V$_{\rm rot}$=19.5 $\pm$ 1.7~km s$^{-1}$. Star's location in the HR-diagram, derived values of $^{12}C/^{13}C$ = 7$\pm$1 and $[C/N]=-0.95\pm 0.2$, and the inferred asteroseismic parameters from secondary calibration based on spectra suggest star is a low-mass red clump giant in the He-core burning phase. Using Gaia data, we found evidence of variation in radial velocity and proper motion, indicative of presence of an unresolved binary. The large V$_{\rm rot}$ is probably a result of tidal synchronization combined with the after-effects of He-flash, in which the size of the star is reduced significantly. The simultaneous presence of features like high rotation, very high Li abundance, strong dust shell, and strong flares in a single star is relatively uncommon, suggesting that the star experiencing tidal synchronization has recently undergone He-flash. The results pose a question whether the binary interaction, hence the high rotation, is a prerequisite for dredging-up of the high amounts of Li from the interior to the photosphere during or immediately after the He-flash event.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are transient radio signals of extragalactic origins that are subjected to propagation effects such as dispersion and scattering. It follows then that these signals hold information regarding the medium they have traversed and are hence useful as cosmological probes of the Universe. Recently, FRBs were used to make an independent measure of the Hubble Constant $H_0$, promising to resolve the Hubble tension given a sufficient number of detected FRBs. Such cosmological studies are dependent on FRB population statistics, cosmological parameters and detection biases, and thus it is important to accurately characterise each of these. In this work, we empirically characterise the sensitivity of the Fast Real-time Engine for Dedispersing Amplitudes (FREDDA) which is the current detection system for the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We coherently redisperse high-time resolution data of 13 ASKAP-detected FRBs and inject them into FREDDA to determine the recovered signal-to-noise ratios as a function of dispersion measure (DM). We find that for 11 of the 13 FRBs, these results are consistent with injecting idealised pulses. Approximating this sensitivity function with theoretical predictions results in a systematic error of 0.3$\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}\,$Mpc$^{-1}$ on $H_0$ when it is the only free parameter. Allowing additional parameters to vary could increase this systematic by up to $\sim1\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}\,$Mpc$^{-1}$. We estimate that this systematic will not be relevant until $\sim$400 localised FRBs have been detected, but will likely be significant in resolving the Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 M- and K-dwarf stars make up 86% of the stellar population and host many promising astronomical targets for detecting habitable climates in the near future. Of the two, M dwarfs currently offer greater observational advantages and are home to many of the most exciting observational discoveries in the last decade. But K dwarfs could offer even better prospects for detecting habitability by combining the advantage of a relatively dim stellar flux with a more stable stellar environment. Here we explore the climate regimes that are possible on Earth-like synchronous planets in M- and K-dwarf systems, and how they vary across the habitable zone. We focus on surface temperature patterns, water availability, and implications for habitability. We find that the risk of nightside cold-trapping decreases with increased orbital radius and is overall lower for K-dwarf planets. With reduced atmospheric shortwave absorption, K-dwarf planets have higher dayside precipitation rates and less day-to-night moisture transport, resulting in lower nightside snow rates. These results imply a higher likelihood of detecting a planet with a moist dayside climate in a habitable "eyeball" climate regime orbiting a K-dwarf star. We also show that "terminator habitability" can occur for both M- and K-dwarf land planets, but would likely be more prevalent in M-dwarf systems. Planets in a terminator habitability regime tend to have slightly lower fractional habitability, but offer alternative advantages including instellation rates more comparable to Earth in regions that have temperatures amenable to life.

 - **Abstract**
 Close-proximity exploration of small celestial bodies is crucial for the comprehensive and accurate characterization of their properties. However, the complex and uncertain dynamical environment around them contributes to a rapid dispersion of uncertainty and the emergence of non-Gaussian distributions. Therefore, to ensure safe operations, a precise understanding of uncertainty propagation becomes imperative. In this work, the dynamical environment is analyzed around two asteroids, Apophis, which will perform a close flyby to Earth in 2029, and Eros, which has been already explored by past missions. The performance of different uncertainty propagation methods (Linear Covariance Propagation, Unscented Transformation, and Polynomial Chaos Expansion) are compared in various scenarios of close-proximity operations around the two asteroids. Findings are discussed in terms of propagation accuracy and computational efficiency depending on the dynamical environment. By exploring these methodologies, this work contributes to the broader goal of ensuring the safety and effectiveness of spacecraft operations during close-proximity exploration of small celestial bodies.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar molecules, which play an important role in astrochemistry, are identified using observed spectral lines. Despite the advent of spectral analysis tools in the past decade, the identification of spectral lines remains a tedious task that requires extensive manual intervention, preventing us from fully exploiting the vast amounts of data generated by large facilities such as ALMA. This study aims to address the aforementioned issue by developing a framework of automated line identification. We introduce a robust spectral fitting technique applicable for spectral line identification with minimal human supervision. Our method is assessed using published data from five line surveys of hot cores, including W51, Orion-KL, Sgr B2(M), and Sgr B2(N). By comparing the identified lines, our algorithm achieves a recall of ~ 84% - 98%. Our code, named Spectuner, is publicly available on GitHub.

 - **Abstract**
 Symbiotic systems often include an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star and a hot compact companion, such as a white dwarf, that are in close interaction. Due to the intense ultraviolet emission from the hot companion, the molecular content of circumstellar envelopes in the symbiotic systems is poor. As a result, the less abundant molecules have not been previously studied in detail in this kind of object. R Aqr is the closest and best-studied symbiotic system. We obtain the spatial distribution of the recombination line H30{\alpha} with a high and moderate angular resolution, and it is compared with the emission of the continuum at 1.3 mm. High-resolution maps of several molecules are also obtained in the three observed ALMA bands. We study the molecular emissions using a simplified model to explain the brightness distributions seen in the central position of our maps. We find that the low-resolution continuum map at 1.3mm shows the emission of the radio photosphere of the AGB star, its surroundings, and the structure of the bipolar jet launched by the companion. The high-resolution continuum map at 1.3mm shows the innermost part of the jet, probably revealing the position of the secondary, and suggests mass transfer from the AGB star to the white dwarf. The brightness distribution of H30{\alpha} is similar but not coincident with the continuum emission. The brightness distributions of the studied molecular lines show a variety of shapes. The emissions of the abundant molecules, CO and SiO, are relatively extended since they can survive far from the AGB star in spite of the intense ultraviolet emission from the white dwarf. On the contrary, less abundant molecules only survive in regions close to the AGB star, where shielding is stronger. From our best-fit model for these weak species, we find that these less abundant species are confined to the intra-orbital regions.

 - **Abstract**
 <Context> Pebbles drifting past a disk-embedded low-mass planet develop asymmetries in their distribution and exert a substantial gravitational torque on the planet, thus modifying its migration rate. <Aims> Our aim is to assess how the distribution of pebbles and the resulting torque change in the presence of pebble accretion, focusing on its 2D regime. <Methods> First, we performed 2D high-resolution multi-fluid simulations with Fargo3D but found that they are impractical for resolving pebble accretion due to the smoothing of the planetary gravitational potential. To remove the smoothing and directly trace pebbles accreted by the planet, we developed a new code, Deneb, which evolves an ensemble of pebbles, represented by Lagrangian superparticles, in a steady-state gaseous background. <Results> For small and moderate Stokes numbers, St $\lesssim 0.1$, pebble accretion creates two underdense regions with a front-rear asymmetry with respect to the planet. The underdensity trailing the planet is more extended. The resulting excess of pebble mass in front of the planet then makes the pebble torque positive and capable of outperforming the negative gas torque. Pebble accretion thus enables outward migration (previously thought to occur mainly for St $\gtrsim 0.1$) in a larger portion of the parameter space. It occurs for the planet mass $M_{pl}\lesssim3\,M_{\oplus}$ and for all the Stokes numbers considered in our study, St $\in$ [$10^{-2}, 0.785$], assuming a pebble-to-gas mass ratio of $Z = 0.01$. <Conclusions> If some of the observed planets underwent outward pebble-driven migration during their accretion, the formation sites of their progenitor embryos could have differed greatly from the usual predictions of planet formation models. To enable an update of the respective models, we provide a scaling law for the pebble torque that can be readily incorporated in N-body simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent spectra of protoplanetary disks around very low-mass stars (VLMS), captured by the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), reveal a rich carbon chemistry. Current interpretations of these spectra are based on 0D slab models and provide valuable estimates for molecular emission temperatures and column densities in the innermost disk. However, the established fitting procedures and simplified models are challenged by the many overlapping gas features. We aim to simultaneously determine the molecular and the dust composition of the disk around the VLMS Sz28 in a Bayesian way. We model the JWST/MIRI spectrum of Sz28 up to $17\,\rm \mu m$ using the Dust Continuum Kit with Line emission from Gas (DuCKLinG). Systematically excluding different molecules from the Bayesian analysis allows for an evidence determination of all investigated molecules and isotopologues. We continue by examining the emission conditions and locations of all molecules, analysing the differences to previous 0D slab fitting, and analysing the dust composition. We find very strong Bayesian evidence for the presence of C2H2, HCN, C6H6, CO2, HC3N, C2H6, C3H4, C4H2, and CH4 in the JWST/MIRI spectrum of Sz28. Additionally, we identify CH3 and find tentative indications for NH3. There is no evidence for water in the spectrum. However, we show that column densities of up to $2\times10^{17}\,\rm cm^{-2}$ could be hidden in the observational noise if assuming similar emission conditions of water as the detected hydrocarbons. Contrary to previous 0D slab results, a C4H2 quasi-continuum is robustly identified. We expect some of the stated differences to previous 0D slab fitting results to arise from an updated data reduction of the spectrum, but also due to the different modelling process. The latter reason underpins the need for more advanced models and fitting procedures.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia mission discovered many new candidate \beta Cephei (\beta Cep) pulsators, which are meanwhile confirmed from TESS space photometry. We aim to analyse all currently available TESS data for these \beta Cep pulsators, of which 145 were new discoveries, in order to exploit their asteroseismic potential. \beta Cep stars belong to an under-represented class of pulsators in the current space photometry revolution while being of critical importance to improve evolution models of massive stars. We extracted light curves for 216 star from the TESS full-frame images and performed pre-whitening. Based on Gaia DR3, we deduced stellar properties and compared them to those of known \beta Cep stars. We developed a methodology to identify the dominant pulsation modes of the \beta Cep stars from Gaia and TESS amplitude ratios and from the detection of rotationally-split multiplets. We used grid modelling to gain insights into the population of \beta Cep stars. With the combination of TESS and Gaia, we successfully identified the mode degrees for 176 stars. of which the majority are dipole non-radial modes. Many non-radial modes show splittings in their TESS frequency spectra allowing us to assemble a large set of split multiplets in \beta Cep stars and to calculate their envelope rotation, spin parameter, and the level of differential envelope-to-surface rotation. For the latter, we find an upper limit of 4, with most stars rotating almost rigidly. We also provide the asymmetries of the multiplets. Based on grid modelling, we provide mass, convective core mass, and ages for 164 stars. By combining Gaia and TESS, we enable asteroseismology of \beta Cep stars as a population. Our study prepares for future detailed modelling based on individual frequencies of identified modes leading towards a better understanding of these massive pulsators, as crucial probes of stellar evolution theory.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-supervised learning (SSL) applied to natural images has demonstrated a remarkable ability to learn meaningful, low-dimension representations without labels, resulting in models that are adaptable to many different tasks. Until now, applications of SSL to astronomical images have been limited to Galaxy Zoo datasets, which require a significant amount of pre-processing to prepare sparse images centered on a single galaxy. With wide-field survey instruments at the forefront of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) era, this approach to gathering training data is impractical. We demonstrate that continuum images from surveys like the MeerKAT Galactic Cluster Legacy Survey (MGCLS) can be successfully used with SSL, without extracting single-galaxy cutouts. Using the SSL framework DINO, we experiment with various preprocessing steps, augmentations, and architectures to determine the optimal approach for this data. We train both ResNet50 and Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones. Our models match state-of-the-art results (trained on Radio Galaxy Zoo) for FRI/FRII morphology classification. Furthermore, they predict the number of compact sources via linear regression with much higher accuracy. However, fine-tuning results in similar performance between our models, the state-of-the-art, and open-source models on multi-class morphology classification. Using source-rich crops from wide-field images to train multi-purpose models is an easily scalable approach that significantly reduces data preparation time. For the tasks evaluated in this work, twenty thousand crops is sufficient training data for models that produce results similar to state-of-the-art. In the future, complex tasks like source detection and characterization, together with domain-specific tasks, ought to demonstrate the true advantages of training models with radio astronomy data over natural-image foundation models.

 - **Abstract**
 We compare and contrast the kinematics of various classes of stars, both normal (with M-K spectral types) and peculiar. Numerous plots show the differences in spatial and velocity distributions as well as distributions in kinetic energy vs. angular momentum (KE vs. LZ) space. In the latter plots, young, thin disk stars on nearly circular orbits cling to the left edge of a so-called solar parabola, while older objects on elliptical orbits fill the central parabolic region. Some of the young Wolf-Rayet stars violate this trend due to smaller semi-major axes than the Sun or orbital eccentricities. Deviation of the vertex of the velocity ellipsoid is discussed as an indication of population and youth, with an emphasis on Ap, Bp, Am, Fm, Herbig AeBe, and lambda Boo stars. Both the vertex deviation and phase space distribution provide useful insights.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the discovery of a dual supermassive black hole system in the radio galaxy J1543-0757, with a projected separation between the two black holes of 46 mas. The result is based on recent multifrequency observations using the Very Long Baseline Array and European VLBI Network, which reveal two compact, variable, flat-spectrum, active nuclei within the elliptical host galaxy of J1543-0757. Multiepoch observations from the VLBA also provide constraints on the spectral index and proper motions of all components. The flat spectra of both N and S at both frequencies strongly support that these radio components are associated with two separate, accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The two nuclei appear stationary, while the jets emanating from the weaker of the two nuclei appear to move out and terminate in bright hot spots. The discovery of this system has implications for the number of close dual black holes that might be sources of gravitational radiation.

 - **Abstract**
 Many circumbinary gas giant planets have been recently discovered. The formation mechanism of circumbinary planets on wide orbits is unclear. We investigate the formation of Delorme 1 (AB)b, a 13$\pm$5M$_{\rm J}$ planet, orbiting its host binary at 84AU. The planet is accreting while having an estimated age of 40Myr, which is unexpected, as this process should have ceased due to the dissipation of the protoplanetary disc. Using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code SEREN, we model three formation scenarios for this planet. In Scenario I the planet forms in-situ on a wide orbit in a massive disc (by gravitational instability), in Scenario II closer to the binary in a massive disc (by gravitational instability), and in Scenario III much closer to the binary in a less massive disc (by core accretion). Planets in Scenario I stay at the observed separation, have mass accretion rates consistent with observed value, but their final mass is too high. In Scenario II, the planet reaches the observed separation through outward migration or scattering by the binary, and has mass accretion rate comparable to the observed; however, the planet mass is above the observed value. In Scenario III, the planet's final mass and mass accretion rate are comparable to the observed ones but the planet's separation is smaller. We conclude that all models may explain some features of the observations but not all of them, raising questions about how gas is accreted onto the planet from its circumplanetary disc, and of the presumed age of the system.

 - **Abstract**
 The gas-phase abundance of carbon, x_C = C/H, and its depletion factors are essential parameters for understanding the gas and solid compositions that are ultimately incorporated into planets. The majority of protoplanetary disks are born in clusters and, as a result, are exposed to external FUV radiation. These FUV photons potentially affect the disk's evolution, chemical composition, and line excitation. We present the first detection of the [CI]609um fine-structure line of neutral carbon (CI), achieved with ALMA, toward one of these disks, d203-506, in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We also report the detection of CI forbidden and permitted lines (from electronically excited states up to 10 eV) observed with JWST in the IR. These lines trace the irradiated outer disk and photo-evaporative wind. Contrary to the common belief that these IR lines are C+ recombination lines, we find that they are dominated by FUV-pumping of CI followed by fluorescence cascades. They trace the transition from atomic to molecular gas, and their intensities scale with G0. The lack of outstanding IR OI fluorescent emission, however, implies a sharper attenuation of external FUV radiation with E > 12 eV (~Lyman-beta). This is related to a lower effective FUV dust absorption cross section compared to that of interstellar grains, implying a more prominent role for FUV shielding by the CI photoionization continuum. The [CI]609um intensity is proportional to N(CI) and can be used to infer x_C. We derive x_C ~ 1.4E-4. This implies that there is no major depletion of volatile carbon compared to x_C measured in the natal cloud, hinting at a young disk. We also show that external FUV radiation impacts the outer disk and wind by vertically shifting the water freeze-out depth, which results in less efficient grain growth and settling. This shift leads to nearly solar gas-phase C/O abundance ratios in these irradiated layers.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a systematic analysis of the early multi-band light curves and colors of 19 Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network SN Program, including 16 previously unpublished events. Seven are detected $\lesssim$ 1 day since the estimated epoch of first light and the rest within $\lesssim$ 3 days. Some show excess emission within $<$ 0.5 days to $\sim$ 2 days, but most show pure power-law rises. The colors are initially diverse before $\sim$ 5 days, but converge to a similar color at $\sim$ 10 days. We identify at least three populations based on 2--5-day color evolution: (1) "early-blues" exhibit slowly-evolving colors consistent with a $\sim$ 17,000 K blackbody; (2) "early-reds" have initially blue $B-V$ and red $V-i$ colors that cannot simultaneously be fit with a blackbody -- likely due to suppression of $B$- and $i$-band flux by Fe II/III and Ca II -- and evolve more rapidly; and (3) "early-yellows" evolve blueward, consistent with thermal heating from $\sim$ 8,000 to 13,000 K. The distributions of early-blue and early-red colors are compatible with them being either distinct populations -- with early-reds comprising (60 $\pm$ 15)% of them -- or extreme ends of one continuous population; whereas the early-yellow population identified here is clearly distinct. Compared to the other populations, early-blues in our sample differ by exhibiting excess emission within 1--2 days, nearly constant peak brightness regardless of $\Delta M_{15}(B)$ after standardization, and shallower Si II features. Early-blues also prefer star-forming host environments, while early-yellows and, to a lesser extent, early-reds prefer quiescent ones. These preferences appear to indicate at least two Type Ia SN production channels based on stellar population age, while early-reds and early-blues may still share a common origin.

 - **Abstract**
 The Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) constitutes a mission intricately designed to systematically survey approximately 100 solar-type stars located within the immediate proximity of the solar system, specifically within a range of 10 parsecs. The core objective of this mission is the detection and characterization of potentially habitable Earth-like planets or super-Earths within the habitable zone of these stars. The CHES mission obtains high-precision astrometric measurements of planets orbiting the target stars by observing angular distance variations between the target star and reference stars. As a result, we surveyed the relevant parameters of both target and reference stars in detail, conducting a thorough analysis and calculation of the required observation accuracy, the number of observations, and the priority assigned to each target star. Observational emphasis will be concentrated on targets considered of higher priority, ensuring the effectiveness of their observation capabilities. Through this approach, we formulate a five-year observation strategy that will cover all the target stars within a six-month timeframe. The strategy not only fulfills the required observing capability but also exhibit high efficiency simultaneously, providing an executable program for future mission. Over the span of the mission's five-year duration, a cumulative observation time of 29,220 hours will be available. Approximately 86 percent of this, totaling 25,120 hours, is allocated for the observation of target stars. This allocation leaves approximately 4,100 hours for extended scientific observation programs. We have also performed simulated observations based on this strategy and verified its observational capability for exoplanets.
