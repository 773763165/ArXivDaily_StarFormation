 - **Abstract**
 We report that HD 110067, the recently announced host star of a resonant sextuplet of transiting sub-Neptunes, is not a single star as claimed in the discovery paper, but a wide hierarchical triple. The K0 V planet hosting star (V = 8.4 mag, d = 32 pc) has a companion at a wide projected separation of 13400 au. This companion, namely HD 110106, is a slightly fainter (V = 8.8 mag) K3 V type 8-year period double-lined spectroscopic binary. The secondary in this spectroscopic binary is contributing a significant amount of flux and has a measured high mass ratio.

 - **Abstract**
 We present six spectroscopically confirmed massive protostructures, spanning a redshift range of $2.5<z<4.5$ in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS) field discovered as part of the Charting Cluster Construction in VUDS and ORELSE (C3VO) survey. We identify and characterize these remarkable systems by applying an overdensity measurement technique on an extensive data compilation of public and proprietary spectroscopic and photometric observations in this highly studied extragalactic field. Each of these six protostructures, i.e., a large scale overdensity (volume $>9000$\thinspace cMpc$^3$) of more than $2.5\sigma_{\delta}$ above the field density levels at these redshifts, have a total mass $M_{tot}\ge10^{14.8}M_\odot$ and one or more highly overdense (overdensity$\thinspace>5\sigma_{\delta}$) peaks. One of the most complex protostructures discovered is a massive ($M_{tot}=10^{15.1}M_\odot$) system at $z\sim3.47$ that contains six peaks and 55 spectroscopic members. We also discover protostructures at $z\sim3.30$ and $z\sim3.70$ that appear to at least partially overlap on sky with the protostructure at $z\sim3.47$, suggesting a possible connection. We additionally report on the discovery of three massive protostructures at $z=2.67$, 2.80, and 4.14 and discuss their properties. Finally, we discuss the relationship between star formation rate and environment in the richest of these protostructures, finding an enhancement of star formation activity in the densest regions. The diversity of the protostructures reported here provide an opportunity to study the complex effects of dense environments on galaxy evolution over a large redshift range in the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a radial velocity (RV) analysis of TOI-1136, a bright TESS system with six confirmed transiting planets, and a seventh single-transiting planet candidate. All planets in the system are amenable to transmission spectroscopy, making TOI-1136 one of the best targets for intra-system comparison of exoplanet atmospheres. TOI-1136 is young ($\sim$ 700 Myr), and the system exhibits transit timing variations (TTVs). The youth of the system contributes to high stellar variability on the order of 50 m s$^{-1}$, much larger than the likely RV amplitude of any of the transiting exoplanets. Utilizing 359 HIRES and APF RVs collected as a part of the TESS-Keck Survey (TKS), and 51 HARPS-N RVs, we experiment with a joint TTV-RV fit. With seven possible transiting planets, TTVs, more than 400 RVs, and a stellar activity model, we posit that we may be presenting the most complex mass recovery of an exoplanet system in the literature to date. By combining TTVs and RVs, we minimized GP overfitting and retrieved new masses for this system: (m$_{b-g}$ = 3.50$^{+0.8}_{-0.7}$, 6.32$^{+1.1}_{-1.3}$, 8.35$^{+1.8}_{-1.6}$, 6.07$^{+1.09}_{-1.01}$, 9.7$^{+3.9}_{-3.7}$, 5.6$^{+4.1}_{-3.2}$ M$_{\oplus}$). We are unable to significantly detect the mass of the seventh planet candidate in the RVs, but we are able to loosely constrain a possible orbital period near 80 days. Future TESS observations might confirm the existence of a seventh planet in the system, better constrain the masses and orbital properties of the known exoplanets, and generally shine light on this scientifically interesting system.

 - **Abstract**
 The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provides an avenue to study black hole accretion flows on event-horizon scales. Fitting a semi-analytical model to EHT observations requires the construction of synthetic images, which is computationally expensive. This study presents an image generation tool in the form of a generative machine learning model, which extends the capabilities of a variational autoencoder. This tool can rapidly and continuously interpolate between a training set of images and can retrieve the defining parameters of those images. Trained on a set of synthetic black hole images, our tool showcases success in both interpolating black hole images and their associated physical parameters. By reducing the computational cost of generating an image, this tool facilitates parameter estimation and model validation for observations of black hole system.

 - **Abstract**
 The recently observed population of 540 free-floating Jupiter-mass objects, including 40 dynamically soft pairs in the Trapezium cluster have raised interesting questions on their formation and evolution. We test various scenarios for the origin and survivability of these free floating Jupiter-mass objects and Jupiter-mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) in the Trapezium cluster. The numerical calculations are performed by direct N-body integration of the stars and planets in the Trapezium cluster starting with a wide variety of planets in various configurations. We discuss four models: SPP, in which selected stars have two outer orbiting Jupiter-mass planets; SPM, where selected stars are orbited by Jupiter-mass planet-moon pairs; ISF in which JuMBOs form in situ with the stars, and FFC, where we introduce a population of free-floating single Jupiter-mass objects, but no initialized binaries. Models FFC and SPP fail to produce enough JuMBOs. Models SPM can produce sufficient JuMBOs, but requires unusually wide orbits for the planet-moon system around the star. The observed JuMBOs and free-floating Jupiter-mass objects in the Trapezium cluster are best reproduced if they formed in pairs and as free-floaters together with the other stars in a smooth (Plummer) density profile with a virial radius of 0.5pc. A fractal stellar distribution also works, but requires relatively recent formations (>0.2Myr after the other stars formed) or a high (50%) initial binary fraction. This would make the primordial binary fraction of JuMBOs even higher than the already large observation fraction of 8%. The fraction of JuMBOs will continue to drop with time, and the lack of JuMBOs in Upper Scorpius could then result in its higher age, causing more JuMBOs to be ionized. We then also predict that the interstellar density of Jupiter-mass objects (mostly singles with 2% lucky surviving binaries) is 0.05/pc$^{3}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The High Energy X-ray Probe is a proposed NASA probe-class mission that combines the power of high angular resolution with a broad X-ray bandpass to provide the necessary leap in capabilities to address the important astrophysical questions of the next decade. HEX-P achieves breakthrough performance by combining technologies developed by experienced international partners. HEX-P will be launched into L1 to enable high observing efficiency. To meet the science goals, the payload consists of a suite of co-aligned X-ray telescopes designed to cover the 0.2 - 80 keV bandpass. The High Energy Telescope (HET) has an effective bandpass of 2 - 80 keV, and the Low Energy Telescope (LET) has an effective bandpass of 0.2 - 20 keV. The combination of bandpass and high observing efficiency delivers a powerful platform for broad science to serve a wide community. The baseline mission is five years, with 30% of the observing time dedicated to the PI-led program and 70% to a General Observer (GO) program. The GO program will be executed along with the PI-led program.

 - **Abstract**
 A notable fraction of helium observations at 1083~nm, probing evaporating atmospheres of short-period gas giants, exhibit a blueshift during transit, which might be indicative of a day-to-night side flow. In this study, we explore the gas dynamic effects of day-to-night temperature contrasts on the escaping atmosphere of a tidally locked planet. Using a combination of 3D hydrodynamic simulations and radiative transfer post-processing, we model transmission spectra of the metastable helium triplet. The key findings are: (1) Increasing day-night anisotropy leads to a narrowing of the helium line and an increase in the blueshift of the line centroid of a few km/s. (2) The velocity shift of the line depends on the line forming altitude, with higher planetary mass-loss rates causing the line to form at higher altitudes, resulting in a more pronounced velocity shift. (3) A critical point of day-night anisotropy exists at which the blueshift saturates due to turbulent flows generated by outflow material falling back onto the planet's night side. (4) A strong stellar wind and the presence of turbulent flows may induce time variations in the velocity shift. Assuming that the day-night temperature gradient is the main cause of the observed blueshifts in the He-1083 nm triplet, the correlation between the velocity shift and day-night anisotropy offers the opportunity to constrain the temperature gradient of the line forming region.
#### The 3D Kinematics of the Orion Nebula Cluster II: Mass-dependent  Kinematics of the Inner Cluster

 - **Abstract**
 We present the kinematic anaylsis of $246$ stars within $4^\prime$ from the center of Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), the closest massive star cluster with active star formation across the full mass range, which provides valuable insights in the the formation and evolution of star cluster on an individual-star basis. High-precision radial velocities and surface temperatures are retrieved from spectra acquired by the NIRSPEC instrument used with adaptive optics (NIRSPAO) on the Keck II 10-m telescope. A three-dimensional kinematic map is then constructed by combining with the proper motions previously measured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ACS/WFPC2/WFC3IR and Keck II NIRC2. The measured root-mean-squared velocity dispersion is $2.26\pm0.08~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, significantly higher than the virial equilibrium's requirement of $1.73~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, suggesting that the ONC core is supervirial, consistent with previous findings. Energy equipartition is not detected in the cluster. Most notably, the velocity of each star relative to its neighbors is found to be negatively correlated with stellar mass. Low-mass stars moving faster than their surrounding stars in a supervirial cluster suggests that the initial masses of forming stars may be related to their initial kinematic states. Additionally, a clockwise rotation preference is detected. A weak sign of inverse mass segregation is also identified among stars excluding the Trapezium stars, though it could be a sample bias. Finally, this study reports the discovery of four new candidate spectroscopic binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we detect double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2) in five open clusters: NGC 2243, NGC 2420, NGC 3532, NGC 6253 and NGC 6705 (M 11) using a method based on high values of the projected rotational velocity when they are fitted with single star spectral model. Observed spectra were obtained from ESO archive. The method was validated on sets of synthetic spectra for the single and binary stars. It is able to reliably select spectroscopic binaries without confusing them with single stars, if components in binary rotate slowly and radial velocity separation is sufficiently high. We found 60 SB2 candidates: two in NGC~2243, eight in NGC~2420 and NGC~3532, 17 in NGC 6253 and 25 in NGC~6705. Comparison with literature confirms 18 of them, thus we found 42 new SB2 candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 The SiO emissions are usually used to trace high-velocity outflow shocks in star-forming regions. However, several studies have found low-velocity and widespread SiO emissions not associated with outflows in molecular clouds. We aim to detect and characterize the SiO emissions in massive dense cores (MDCs), and explore the properties of the central sources of SiO emission. We present high-angular-resolution ($\sim$1.5$^{\prime\prime}$) observations of the SiO (5$-$4) line made with the Submillimeter Array towards a sample of 48 MDCs in the Cygnus-X star-forming complex. We studied the SiO emission structures, including their morphologies, kinematics, and energetics, and investigated their relationship with the evolution of the central sources. The SiO (5$-$4) emission is detected in 16 out of 48 MDCs. We identify 14 bipolar and 18 unipolar SiO (5$-$4) outflows associated with 29 dust condensations. Most outflows (24 out of 32) are associated with excess Spitzer 4.5 $\mu$m emissions. We also find diffuse low-velocity ($\Delta{v}$ $\le$ 1.2 km s$^{-1}$) SiO (5$-$4) emission closely surrounding the dust condensations in two MDCs, and suggest that it may originate from decelerated outflow shocks or large-scale shocks from global cloud collapse. We find that the SMA SiO (5$-$4) emission in MDCs is mostly associated with outflows. Probably due to the relatively high excitation of SiO (5$-$4) compared to SiO (2$-$1) and due to the spatial filtering effect, we do not detect large-scale low-velocity SiO (5$-$4) emission, but detect more compact low-velocity emission in close proximity to the dust condensations. We group the sources into different evolutionary stages based on the infrared emission, radio continuum emission, and gas temperature properties of the outflow central sources, and find that the 24 $\mu$m luminosity tends to increase with evolution.
#### Early $\rm TeV$ photons of GRB 221009A were absorbed by the prompt MeV  photons

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.04886
 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A produced the highest flux of gigaelectronvolt-teraelectronvolt ($\rm GeV-TeV$) photons ever observed, allowing the construction of a detailed $\rm TeV$ light curve. We focus on explaining the noticeable dip in the light curve around $2$-$5\ \rm s$ after the onset of $\rm TeV$ emission. We propose that Megaelectronvolt (MeV) photons from the prompt emission annihilate with $\rm TeV$ photons from the afterglow, producing an optical depth that obscures the $\rm TeV$ emission during this period. We develop a two-zone model accounting for the angles of MeV photons that can successfully reproduce the time delay between MeV and $\rm TeV$ photons, the peak optical depth over 3, and the rapid decline in optical depth. Our model supports $\rm MeV-TeV$ annihilation as the cause of the dip and provides reasonable constraints on the emission region parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will produce an unprecedented astronomical data set for studies of the deep and dynamic universe. Its Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will image the entire southern sky every three to four days and produce tens of petabytes of raw image data and associated calibration data over the course of the experiment's run. More than 20 terabytes of data must be stored every night, and annual campaigns to reprocess the entire dataset since the beginning of the survey will be conducted over ten years. The Production and Distributed Analysis (PanDA) system was evaluated by the Rubin Observatory Data Management team and selected to serve the Observatory's needs due to its demonstrated scalability and flexibility over the years, for its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) support, its support for multi-site processing, and its highly scalable complex workflows via the intelligent Data Delivery Service (iDDS). PanDA is also being evaluated for prompt processing where data must be processed within 60 seconds after image capture. This paper will briefly describe the Rubin Data Management system and its Data Facilities (DFs). Finally, it will describe in depth the work performed in order to integrate the PanDA system with the Rubin Observatory to be able to run the Rubin Science Pipelines using PanDA.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrochemical simulations are a powerful tool for revealing chemical evolution in the interstellar medium. Astrochemical calculations require efficient processing of large matrices for the chemical networks. The large chemical reaction networks often present bottlenecks for computation because of time derivatives of chemical abundances. We propose an efficient algorithm using a stoichiometry matrix approach in which this time-consuming part is expressed as a loop, unlike the algorithm used in previous studies. Since stoichiometry matrices are sparse in general, the performances of simulations with our algorithm depend on which sparse-matrix storage format is used. We conducted a performance comparison experiment using the common storage formats, including the coordinate (COO) format, the compressed column storage (CCS) format, the compressed row storage (CRS) format, and the Sliced ELLPACK (SELL) format. Experimental results showed that the simulations with the CRS format are the most suitable for astrochemical simulations and about three times faster than those with the algorithm used in previous studies. In addition, our algorithm significantly reduces not only the computation time but also the compilation time. We also explore the beneficial effects of parallelization and sparse-matrix reordering in these algorithms.
#### Revisiting the effects of baryon physics on small-scale redshift space  distortions

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.05009
 - **Abstract**
 Redshift space distortions are an important probe of the growth of large-scale structure and for constraining cosmological parameters in general. As galaxy redshift surveys approach percent level precision in their observations of the two point clustering statistics, it is timely to review what effects baryons and associated processes such as feedback may have on small-scale clustering in redshift space. Contrary to previous studies in the literature, we show using the large-volume BAHAMAS hydrodynamic simulations that the effect of baryons can be as much as 1% in the k ~ 0.1 h/Mpc range for the monopole and 5% for quadrupole, and that this could rise to as much as 10% at k~10 h/Mpc in both measurements. For the halo power spectra, this difference can be as much 3-4% in the monopole on scales of 0.05 < k < 0.3 h/Mpc for 10^{13} M_sun/h haloes. We find that these deviations can be mitigated to the sub-percent level in the both the monopole and quadrupole up to k ~ 0.3 h/Mpc if the baryon corrected halo masses are used to calculate the redshift space power spectra. Finally, we use the cosmo-OWLS simulation suite to explore the changes in the redshift space power spectra with different feedback prescriptions, finding that there is a maximum of 15-20% difference between the redshift space monopole and quadrupole with and without baryons at k ~1-2 h/Mpc within these models.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of $Gaia$ DR3 provides a large sample of stars with complete 6D information, offering a fertile ground for the exploration of stellar objects that were accreted to the Milky Way through ancient merger events. In this study, we developed a deep learning methodology to identify ex-situ stars within the $Gaia$ DR3 catalogue. After two phases of training, our neural network (NN) model was capable of performing binary classification of stars based on input data consisting of 3D position and velocity, as well as actions. From the target sample of 27 085 748 stars, our NN model managed to identify 160 146 ex-situ stars. The metallicity distribution suggests that this ex-situ sample comprises multiple components but appears to be predominated by the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus. We identified member stars of the Magellanic Clouds, Sagittarius, and 20 globular clusters throughout our examination. Furthermore, an extensive group of member stars from Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, Thamnos, Sequoia, Helmi streams, Wukong, and Pontus were meticulously selected, constituting an ideal sample for the comprehensive study of substructures. Finally, we conducted a preliminary estimation to determine the proportions of ex-situ stars in the thin disc, thick disc, and halo, which resulted in percentages of 0.1%, 1.6%, and 63.2%, respectively. As the vertical height from the Galactic disc and distance from the Galactic centre increased, there was a corresponding upward trend in the ex-situ fraction of the target sample.

 - **Abstract**
 KASCADE-Grande, the extension of the multi-detector setup of KASCADE, was devoted to measure the properties of extensive air showers initiated by high-energy cosmic rays in the primary energy range of 1 PeV up to 1 EeV. The observations of the energy spectrum and mass composition of cosmic rays contribute with great detail to the understanding of the transition from galactic to extragalactic origin of cosmic rays, and furthermore to validate the properties of hadronic interaction models in the air shower development. Although the experiment is fully dismantled, the analysis of the entire KASCADE-Grande data set continues. We have recently investigated the impact of different post-LHC hadronic interaction models, QGSJETII-04, EPOS-LHC, Sibyll 2.3d, on air shower predictions in terms of the reconstructed spectra of heavy and light primary masses, including systematic uncertainties. In addition, the conversely discussed evolution of the muon content of high-energy air showers in the atmosphere is compared with the predictions of different interaction models. In this contribution, the latest results from the KASCADE-Grande measurements will be discussed.
#### Box Replication Effects in Weak Lensing Light-cone Construction

 - **Abstract**
 Weak gravitational lensing simulations serve as indispensable tools for obtaining precise cosmological constraints. In particular, it is crucial to address the systematic uncertainties in theoretical predictions, given the rapid increase in galaxy numbers and the reduction in observational noise. Both on-the-fly and post-processing methods for constructing lensing light-cones encounter limitations due to the finite simulated volume, necessitating the replication of the simulation box to encompass the volume to high redshifts. To address this issue, our primary focus lies on investigating and quantifying the impact of box replication on the convergence power spectrum and higher-order moments of lensing fields. By combining the KS test with these statistics, we confirm that there is a probability exceeding 99\% to observe the significant statistical deviation from the correct measurements for all investigated special line-of-sight directions, e.g., x-axis direction. Additionally, we have developed a code that facilitates the identification of optimal viewing angles for the light-cone construction. This code has been made publicly accessible.

 - **Abstract**
 The splashback radius, coinciding with the minimum in the dark matter radial density gradient, is thought to be a universal definition of the edge of a dark matter halo. Observational methods to detect it have traced the dark matter using weak gravitational lensing or galaxy number counts. Recent attempts have also claimed the detection of a similar feature in Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) observations of the hot intracluster gas. Here, we use the FLAMINGO simulations to investigate whether a reflection of the splashback feature is predicted to occur in the cluster gas profiles. We find that the minimum in the gradient of the stacked 3D gas density and pressure profiles, and the maximum in the entropy profile, broadly align with the splashback feature though there are significant differences. While the dark matter splashback radius varies with specific mass accretion rate, in agreement with previous work, the radial position of the feature in the gas density is more sensitive to halo mass. In addition, we show that the feature is also present in projected 2D pseudo-observable profiles: emission measure (X-ray); Compton-$y$ (SZ) and surface mass density (weak lensing). We find that the latter traces the dark matter results reasonably well albeit the feature occurs at a slightly smaller radius. While results for the gas profiles are largely insensitive to accretion rate and various observable proxies for dynamical state, they do depend on the strength of the feedback processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Kuiper belt objects are thought to be formed at least a few million years after the formation of calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions, at a time when the $^{26}$Al isotope -- the major source of radiogenic heat in the early Solar System -- had significantly depleted. The internal structure of these objects is highly dependent on any additional source that can produce extra heat in addition to that produced by the remaining, long-lasting radioactive isotopes. In this paper, we explore how serpentinization, the hydration of silicate minerals, can contribute to the heat budget and to what extent it can modify the internal structure of large Kuiper belt objects. We find that the extent of restructuring depends very strongly on the start time of the formation process, the size of the object, and the starting ice-to-rock ratio. Serpentinization is able to restructure most of the interior of all objects in the whole size range (400-1200\,km) and ice-to-rock ratio range investigated if the process starts early, $\sim$3\,Myr after CAI formation, potentially leading to a predominantly serpentine core much earlier than previously thought ($\leq$5\,Myr vs. several tens of million years). While the ratio of serpentinized material gradually decreases with the increasing formation time, the increasing ice-to-rock ratio, and the increasing start time of planetesimal formation in the outer solar system, in the case of the largest objects a significant part of the interior will be serpentinized even if the formation starts relatively late, $\sim$5\,Myr after CAI formation. Therefore it is feasible that the interior of planetesimals may have contained a significant amount of serpentine, and in some cases, it could have been a dominant constituent, at the time of satellite-forming impacts.

 - **Abstract**
 The rotation state of small asteroids is affected in the long term by perturbing torques of gravitational and radiative origin (the YORP effect). Direct observational evidence of the YORP effect is the primary goal of our work. We carried out photometric observations of five near-Earth asteroids: (1862) Apollo, (2100) Ra-Shalom, (85989) 1999 JD6, (138852) 2000 WN10, and (161989) Cacus. Then we applied the light-curve inversion method to all available data to determine the spin state and a convex shape model for each of the five studied asteroids. In the case of (2100) Ra-Shalom, the analysis required that the spin-axis precession due to the solar gravitational torque also be included. We obtained two new detections of the YORP effect: (i) $(2.9 \pm 2.0)\times 10^{-9}\,\mathrm{rad\,d}^{-2}$ for (2100) Ra-Shalom, and (ii) $(5.5\pm 0.7)\times 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{rad\,d}^{-2}$ for (138852) 2000 WN10. The analysis of Ra-Shalom also reveals a precession of the spin axis with a precession constant $\sim 3000''\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. This is the first such detection from Earth-bound photometric data. For the other two asteroids, we improved the accuracy of the previously reported YORP detection: (i) $(4.94 \pm 0.09)\times 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{rad\,d}^{-2}$ for (1862) Apollo, and (ii) $(1.86\pm 0.09)\times 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{rad\,d}^{-2}$ for (161989) Cacus. Despite the recent report of a detected YORP effect for (85989) 1999 JD6, we show that the model without YORP cannot be rejected statistically. Therefore, the detection of the YORP effect for this asteroid requires future observations. The spin-axis precession constant of Ra-Shalom determined from observations matches the theoretically expected value. The total number of asteroids with a YORP detection has increased to 12. In all cases, the rotation frequency increases in time.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the robustness of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) analysis to the underlying cosmological model. We focus on testing the standard BAO analysis that relies on the use of a template. These templates are constructed assuming a fixed fiducial cosmological model and used to extract the location of the acoustic peaks. Such ``compressed analysis'' had been shown to be unbiased when applied to the $\Lambda$CDM model and some of its extensions. However, it has not been known whether this type of analysis introduces biases in a wider range of cosmological models where the template may not fully capture relevant features in the BAO signal. In this study, we apply the compressed analysis to noiseless mock power spectra that are based on Horndeski models, a broad class of modified-gravity theories specified with eight additional free parameters. We study the precision and accuracy of the BAO peak-location extraction assuming DESI, DESI II, and MegaMapper survey specifications. We find that the bias in the extracted peak locations is negligible; for example, it is less than 10% of the statistical error for even the proposed future MegaMapper survey. Our findings indicate that the compressed BAO analysis is remarkably robust to the underlying cosmological model.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the capability of measuring lensing signals in $LiteBIRD$ full-sky polarization maps. With a $30$ arcmin beam width and an impressively low polarization noise of $2.16\,\mu$K-arcmin, $LiteBIRD$ will be able to measure the full-sky polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) very precisely. This unique sensitivity also enables the reconstruction of a nearly full-sky lensing map using only polarization data, even considering its limited capability to capture small-scale CMB anisotropies. In this paper, we investigate the ability to construct a full-sky lensing measurement in the presence of Galactic foregrounds, finding that several possible biases from Galactic foregrounds should be negligible after component separation by harmonic-space internal linear combination. We find that the signal-to-noise ratio of the lensing is approximately $40$ using only polarization data measured over $90\%$ of the sky. This achievement is comparable to $Planck$'s recent lensing measurement with both temperature and polarization and represents a four-fold improvement over $Planck$'s polarization-only lensing measurement. The $LiteBIRD$ lensing map will complement the $Planck$ lensing map and provide several opportunities for cross-correlation science, especially in the northern hemisphere.

 - **Abstract**
 We estimate the efficiency of mitigating the lensing $B$-mode polarization, the so-called delensing, for the $LiteBIRD$ experiment with multiple external data sets of lensing-mass tracers. The current best bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, is limited by lensing rather than Galactic foregrounds. Delensing will be a critical step to improve sensitivity to $r$ as measurements of $r$ become more and more limited by lensing. In this paper, we extend the analysis of the recent $LiteBIRD$ forecast paper to include multiple mass tracers, i.e., the CMB lensing maps from $LiteBIRD$ and CMB-S4-like experiment, cosmic infrared background, and galaxy number density from $Euclid$- and LSST-like survey. We find that multi-tracer delensing will further improve the constraint on $r$ by about $20\%$. In $LiteBIRD$, the residual Galactic foregrounds also significantly contribute to uncertainties of the $B$-modes, and delensing becomes more important if the residual foregrounds are further reduced by an improved component separation method.

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular abundances in protoplanetary disks are highly sensitive to the local physical conditions, including gas temperature, gas density, radiation field, and dust properties. Often multiple factors are intertwined, impacting the abundances of both simple and complex species. We present a new approach to understanding these chemical and physical interdependencies using machine learning. Specifically we explore the case of CO modeled under the conditions of a generic disk and build an explanatory regression model to study the dependence of CO spatial density on the gas density, gas temperature, cosmic ray ionization rate, X-ray ionization rate, and UV flux. Our findings indicate that combinations of parameters play a surprisingly powerful role in regulating CO compared to any singular physical parameter. Moreover, in general, we find the conditions in the disk are destructive toward CO. CO depletion is further enhanced in an increased cosmic ray environment and in disks with higher initial C/O ratios. These dependencies uncovered by our new approach are consistent with previous studies, which are more modeling intensive and computationally expensive. Our work thus shows that machine learning can be a powerful tool not only for creating efficient predictive models, but also for enabling a deeper understanding of complex chemical processes.
#### The Long Secondary Period (LSP) Variables: Overview and Some Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 We briefly review the phenomenon of long secondary periods (LSPs) in red giants, and the LSP variable stars classification introduced in the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) variable star catalog; they are red giant Long Period Variables (LPVs) in which their LSP variability is significantly greater than their pulsational variability. We then describe and discuss the results of a period and amplitude analysis of a random sample of 35 LSP variables in the ASAS-SN catalog, using ASAS-SN data and the AAVSO VStar time-series analysis software. The pulsation period and amplitude, and LSP, all increase with increasing luminosity or size of the star, as expected. The behavior of the LSP amplitude is more complicated; it appears to be larger in moderate-luminosity stars, and smaller in low- and high-luminosity stars. In particular, it is relatively small in a sample of 27 Mira stars, analyzed separately using AAVSO visual data. These results are discussed in the context of the current model for the LSP phenomenon, namely that it is caused by eclipses of the red giant star by a dust-enshrouded companion.
