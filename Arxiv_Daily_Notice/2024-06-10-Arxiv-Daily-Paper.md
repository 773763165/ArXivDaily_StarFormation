 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter makes up approximately 85% of total matter in our universe, yet it has never been directly observed in any laboratory on Earth. The origin of dark matter is one of the most important questions in contemporary physics, and a convincing detection of dark matter would be a Nobel-Prize-level breakthrough in fundamental science. The ABRACADABRA experiment was specifically designed to search for dark matter. Although it has not yet made a discovery, ABRACADABRA has produced several dark matter search results widely endorsed by the physics community. The experiment generates ultra-long time-series data at a rate of 10 million samples per second, where the dark matter signal would manifest itself as a sinusoidal oscillation mode within the ultra-long time series. In this paper, we present the TIDMAD -- a comprehensive data release from the ABRACADABRA experiment including three key components: an ultra-long time series dataset divided into training, validation, and science subsets; a carefully-designed denoising score for direct model benchmarking; and a complete analysis framework which produces a community-standard dark matter search result suitable for publication as a physics paper. This data release enables core AI algorithms to extract the signal and produce real physics results thereby advancing fundamental science.

 - **Abstract**
 Internal gravity waves (IGWs) are likely to cause mixing in stellar interiors. Studies show that the mixing by these waves changes drastically across age and mass (Varghese et al. 2023, arXiv:2211.06432). Here, we study the effect of rotation on this wave mixing by considering a 7 M$_{\odot}$ model at ZAMS and midMS. We compare the mixing profiles at a range of rotation rates ($1\times 10^{-5}$, $2\times 10^{-5}$, $3\times 10^{-5}$, $4\times 10^{-5}$ and $1\times 10^{-4}$ rad.s$^{-1}$) and observe that the mixing decreases with decreasing Rossby number. This can be attributed to the effect of rotation on convection which influences the amplitude with which the waves are excited near the convective-radiative interface.

 - **Abstract**
 Pixelated dark energy is a string theory scenario with a quantum mechanically stable cosmological constant. The number of pixels that make up the universe slowly increases, manifesting as a time-dependent source of dark energy. DESI has recently reported evidence for dynamical dark energy that fits within this framework. In light of this, we perform the first cosmological analysis of the pixelated model. We find that the simplest model where the pixel growth rate is constant is unable to accommodate the data, providing a comparable fit to $\Lambda$CDM; but that models where the pixel growth rate is increasing and of order the Hubble constant today are compatible. Our analysis helps to clarify the features of UV constructions of dark energy necessary to accommodate the data.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of our Galaxy's high-velocity clouds (HVCs) remains a mystery after many decades of effort. In this paper, we use the TNG50 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project to identify cool, dense clouds that match observations of Galactic HVCs. We track these clouds back in time to determine their origin. We find that only 17% of HVCs (by mass) can be tracked directly to the disk, and 21% to satellite accretion. The majority of HVCs (62%) arise from warm and hot circumgalactic gas that cools through thermal instability. They then obtain their anomalous velocities through interactions with the turbulent circumgalactic medium. At TNG50 resolution, we do not see evidence for HVCs forming out of very low metallicity intergalactic material. Instead, low metallicity HVCs are most likely associated with satellite accretion. These results suggest that Galactic HVCs are highly heterogeneous in their origin, and can provide insight into the physical processes that shape the circumgalactic medium such as disk outflows, satellite accretion, and thermal instabilities.

          Observational constraints on thawing quintessence scalar field model

 - **Abstract**
 Thawing quintessence scalar field models with the various potential forms to explain the late-time cosmic acceleration are compared to the {\Lambda}CDM model in detail by analyzing cosmological parameters with a set of observational data including H(z), BAO, CMB, SNIa, BBN, and f(z){\sigma}8 at the background and the perturbation levels. At low redshifts for the thawing quintessence scalar field models, the growth rate of the cosmic structure is significant. By utilizing a standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure based on the recent expansion and the growth observational data with the statistical values of the Akaike and the Bayesian information criteria, we discuss the consistency of the thawing quintessence scalar field models with the set of different potentials with the observational data. The main consequence of this work is that despite the various considered potential forms that are very popular in the literature, we should be looking for consistent potential forms with observational data.

          Sulfur Dioxide and Other Molecular Species in the Atmosphere of the Sub-Neptune GJ 3470 b

 - **Abstract**
 We report observations of the atmospheric transmission spectrum of the sub-Neptune exoplanet GJ 3470 b taken using the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) on JWST. Combined with two archival HST/WFC3 transit observations and fifteen archival Spitzer transit observations, we detect water, methane, sulfur dioxide, and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of GJ 3470 b, each with a significance of >3-sigma. GJ 3470 b is the lowest mass -- and coldest -- exoplanet known to show a substantial sulfur dioxide feature in its spectrum, at $M_{p}$=11.2${\,{\rm M}_{\oplus}}$ and $T_{eq}$=600$\,$K. This indicates disequilibrium photochemistry drives sulfur dioxide production in exoplanet atmospheres over a wider range of masses and temperatures than has been reported or expected. The water, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide abundances we measure indicate an atmospheric metallicity of approximately $100\times$ Solar. We see further evidence for disequilibrium chemistry in our inferred methane abundance, which is significantly lower than expected from equilibrium models consistent with our measured water and carbon dioxide abundances.

          Modeling Time-Variable Elemental Abundances in Coronal Loop Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Numerous recent X-ray observations of coronal loops in both active regions (ARs) and solar flares have shown clearly that elemental abundances vary with time. Over the course of a flare, they have been found to move from coronal values towards photospheric values near the flare peak, before slowly returning to coronal values during the gradual phase. Coronal loop models typically assume that the elemental abundances are fixed, however. In this work, we introduce a time-variable abundance factor into the 0D ebtel++ code that models the changes due to chromospheric evaporation in order to understand how this affects coronal loop cooling. We find that for strong heating events ($\gtrsim$ 1 erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-3}$), the abundances quickly tend towards photospheric values. For smaller heating rates, the abundances fall somewhere between coronal and photospheric values, causing the loop to cool more quickly than the time-fixed photospheric cases (typical flare simulations) and more slowly than time-fixed coronal cases (typical AR simulations). This suggests heating rates in quiescent AR loops no larger than $\approx 0.1$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-3}$ to be consistent with recent measurements of abundance factors $f \gtrsim 2$.

 - **Abstract**
 The W. M. Keck Observatory is welcoming a new era where data reduction and archiving are tightly integrated into our observing model, under the auspices of the Observatory's Data Services Initiative (DSI) project. While previously the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) archived minimally processed, raw science data the day after observing, Keck is transitioning to a model in which it archives both raw frames and reduced data in near real-time. These data will be made available to observers and collaborators immediately upon ingestion through a dedicated new interface that will support collaboration and sharing among teams, as well as stream data directly to personal computers without access to WMKO's internal networks. Both the raw and science-ready data products will be made publicly available upon the expiration of data protections.

          Towards Precision Photometric Type Ia Supernova Cosmology with Machine Learning

 - **Abstract**
 The revolutionary discovery of dark energy and accelerating cosmic expansion was made with just 42 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in 1999. Since then, large synoptic surveys, e.g., Dark Energy Survey (DES), have observed thousands more SNe Ia and the upcoming Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and Roman Space Telescope promise to deliver millions in the next decade. This unprecedented data volume can be used to test concordance cosmology. However, extracting a pure SN Ia sample with accurate redshifts for such a large dataset will be a challenge. Spectroscopic classification will not be possible for the vast majority of discovered objects, and only 25% will have spectroscopic redshifts. This thesis presents a series of observational and methodological studies designed to address the questions associated with this new era of photometric SN Ia cosmology. First, we present a machine learning (ML) method for SN photometric classification, SCONE. Photometric classification enables SNe with no spectroscopic information to be categorized, a critical step for cosmological analysis. SCONE achieves 99+% accuracy distinguishing simulated SNe Ia from non-Ia SNe, and is a part of DES, LSST, and Roman analysis pipelines. We also show that SCONE can classify 6 SN types with 75% accuracy on the night of initial discovery, comparable to results in the literature for full-phase SNe. Next, we study current methods for estimating SN Ia redshifts and propose an ML alternative that uses SN photometry alone to extract redshift information. Photo-zSNthesis is a host galaxy-independent redshift estimator accurate to within 2% across the redshift range of LSST, a first in the literature. Finally, we focus on ML robustness and demonstrate a general method for improving robustness that achieves new state-of-the-art results on astronomical object classification, wildlife identification, and tumor detection.

 - **Abstract**
 I conducted a new search for dispersed radio pulses from the X-ray pulsar PSR J0537$-$6910 in the Large Magellanic Cloud in a long (11.6 hr) archival 1.4 GHz Parkes search observation. I searched dispersion measures (DMs) between 0 and 10000 pc cm$^{-3}$ and detected 49 pulses with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) greater than 7 at a wide range of DMs using the HEIMDALL and FETCH pulse detection and classification packages. All of the pulses were weak, with none having a S/N above 8.5. There was a significant excess of pulses observed in the DM range of the known pulsar population in the LMC, suggesting that these pulses may originate from LMC pulsars. Three repeat pulses, each having widths $\lesssim 1$ ms, were detected in a single DM trial of 103.412 pc cm$^{-3}$, which is in the LMC DM range. This is unlikely to occur by chance in a single DM trial in this search at the (marginally significant) 4.3$\sigma$ level. It remains unclear whether any of the detected pulses in the sample are from PSR J0537$-$6910 itself.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying transient phenomena, such as individual pulses from pulsars, has garnered considerable attention in the era of astronomical big data. Of specific interest to this study are Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs), nulling, and intermittent pulsars. This study introduces a new algorithm named LuNfit, tailored to correct the selection biases originating from the telescope and detection pipelines. Ultimately LuNfit estimates the intrinsic luminosity distribution and nulling fraction of the single pulses emitted by pulsars. LuNfit relies on Bayesian nested sampling so that the parameter space can be fully explored. Bayesian nested sampling also provides the additional benefit of simplifying model comparisons through the Bayes ratio. The robustness of LuNfit is shown through simulations and applying LuNfit onto pulsars with known nulling fractions. LuNfit is then applied to three RRATs, J0012+5431, J1538+1523, and J2355+1523, extracting their intrinsic luminosity distribution and burst rates. We find that their nulling fraction is 0.4(2), 0.749(5) and 0.995(2) respectively. We further find that a log-normal distribution likely describes the single pulse luminosity distribution of J0012+5431 and J1538+1523, while the Bayes ratio for J2355+1523 slightly favors an exponential distribution. We show the conventional method of correcting selection effects by "scaling up" the missed fraction of radio transients can be unreliable when the mean luminosity of the source is faint relative to the telescope sensitivity. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the current implementation of LuNfit while also delving into potential enhancements that would enable LuNfit to be applied to sources with complex pulse morphologies.

          The Active Optics System on the Vera C. Rubin Observatory: Optimal Control of Degeneracy Among the Large Number of Degrees of Freedom

 - **Abstract**
 The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is a unique facility for survey astronomy that will soon be commissioned and begin operations. Crucial to many of its scientific goals is the achievement of sustained high image quality, limited only by the seeing at the site. This will be maintained through an Active Optics System (AOS) that controls optical element misalignments and corrects mirror figure error to minimize aberrations caused by both thermal and gravitational distortions. However, the large number of adjustment degrees of freedom available on the Rubin Observatory introduces a range of degeneracies, including many that are \textit{noise-induced} due to imperfect measurement of the wavefront errors. We present a structured methodology for identifying these degeneracies through an analysis of image noise level. We also present a novel scaling strategy based on Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD) that mitigates the degeneracy, and optimally distributes the adjustment over the available degrees of freedom. Our approach ensures the attainment of optimal image quality, while avoiding excursions around the noise-induced subspace of degeneracies, marking a significant improvement over the previous techniques adopted for Rubin, which were based on an Optimal Integral Controller (OIC). This new approach is likely to also yield significant benefits for all telescopes that incorporate large numbers of degrees of freedom of adjustment.

 - **Abstract**
 Mitigating the far sidelobes of a wide field-of-view telescope is one of the critical issues for polarization observation of the cosmic microwave background. Since even small reflections of stray light at the millimeter-wave absorbers inside the telescope may create nonnegligible far sidelobes, we have developed a method to measure the reflectance of millimeter-wave absorbers, including diffuse reflections. By applying the planar near-field measurement method to the absorbers, we have enabled two-dimensional diffuse-reflection measurements, in addition to characterizing specular reflection. We have measured the reflectance of five samples (TK RAM Large and Small Tiles and Eccosorb AN-72, HR-10, and LS-22) at two angles of incidence in the frequency range from 70 GHz to 110 GHz. Compared with conventional horn-to-horn measurements, we obtained a consistent specular reflectance with a higher precision, less affected by standing waves. We have demonstrated that the angular response and diffuse-to-specular reflectance ratio differ among various materials. The measurements also imply that some absorbers may affect the polarization direction when reflecting the incident waves.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent hydrodynamical simulations of the late stages of supernova remnant (SNR) evolution have revealed that as they merge with the ambient medium, SNRs implode, leading to the formation of dense clouds in their center. While being highly chemically enriched by their host SNR, these clouds appear to have similar properties as giant molecular clouds, which are believed to be the main site of star formation. Here, we develop a simple model, in order to estimate the efficiency of the star formation that might be triggered by the implosion of SNRs. We separately consider two cases, cyclic star formation, maintained by the episodic driving of feedback from new generations of stars; and a single burst of star formation, triggered by a single explosion. We find that in the cyclic case, star formation is inefficient, with implosion-triggered star-formation contributing a few percent of the observed star-formation efficiency per free-fall timescale. In the single-burst case, higher star-formation efficiencies can be obtained. However, while the implosion-triggered process might not contribute much to the overall star-formation, due to the high chemical enrichment of the birth clouds, it can explain the formation of a significant fraction of metal-rich stars.

          Mitigation of DESI fiber assignment incompleteness effect on two-point clustering with small angular scale truncated estimators

 - **Abstract**
 We present a method to mitigate the effects of fiber assignment incompleteness in two-point power spectrum and correlation function measurements from galaxy spectroscopic surveys, by truncating small angular scales from estimators. We derive the corresponding modified correlation function and power spectrum windows to account for the small angular scale truncation in the theory prediction. We validate this approach on simulations reproducing the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 (DR1) with and without fiber assignment. We show that we recover unbiased cosmological constraints using small angular scale truncated estimators from simulations with fiber assignment incompleteness, with respect to standard estimators from complete simulations. Additionally, we present an approach to remove the sensitivity of the fits to high $k$ modes in the theoretical power spectrum, by applying a transformation to the data vector and window matrix. We find that our method efficiently mitigates the effect of fiber assignment incompleteness in two-point correlation function and power spectrum measurements, at low computational cost and with little statistical loss.

          Cosmological Forecasts from the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in 21cm Intensity Mapping

 - **Abstract**
 We use the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the angular power spectrum (APS) of the 21cm line of neutral hydrogen (HI) to constrain cosmological parameters. As the BAO shift parameter can only constrain the product of the Hubble constant and the sound horizon $H_0r_s$, we combine our Fisher matrices with cosmic microwave background (CMB) Fisher matrices from the covariance of $Planck$ telescope to break this degeneracy. In particular, we find that the best constraints we can get with this method are on the Hubble parameter $h$, and the dark energy parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$. Assuming a noise level as for the BINGO telescope, we find $\sigma_h = 0.0055\;(0.8\%)$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model. For the $w$CDM model, we find $\sigma_h = 0.020\;(2.9\%)$ and $\sigma_{w_0} = 0.075\;(7.5\%)$. In the CPL parameterization, we find $\sigma_h = 0.029\;(4.4\%)$, $\sigma_{w_0} = 0.40\;(40\%)$, and $\sigma_{w_a} = 1.7$. Although these constraints improve those from $Planck$ alone, we observe the BINGO data will be more significant for the $w$CDM model. We also observe the constraints from the BAO only is not as strong as using the whole 21cm angular power spectrum, but it is less susceptible to systematic effects.

 - **Abstract**
 The $\beta$ Pictoris system is the closest known stellar system with directly detected gas giant planets, an edge-on circumstellar disc, and evidence of falling sublimating bodies and transiting exocomets. The inner planet, $\beta$ Pictoris c, has also been indirectly detected with radial velocity (RV) measurements. The star is a known $\delta$ Scuti pulsator, and the long-term stability of these pulsations opens up the possibility of indirectly detecting the gas giant planets through time delays of the pulsations due to a varying light travel time. We search for phase shifts in the $\delta$ Scuti pulsations consistent with the known planets $\beta$ Pictoris b and c and carry out an analysis of the stellar pulsations of $\beta$ Pictoris over a multi-year timescale. We used photometric data collected by the BRITE-Constellation, bRing, ASTEP, and TESS to derive a list of the strongest and most significant $\delta$ Scuti pulsations. We carried out an analysis with the open-source python package maelstrom to study the stability of the pulsation modes of $\beta$ Pictoris in order to determine the long-term trends in the observed pulsations. We did not detect the expected signal for $\beta$ Pictoris b or $\beta$ Pictoris c. The expected time delay is 6 seconds for $\beta$ Pictoris c and 24 seconds for $\beta$ Pictoris b. With simulations, we determined that the photometric noise in all the combined data sets cannot reach the sensitivity needed to detect the expected timing drifts. An analysis of the pulsational modes of $\beta$ Pictoris using maelstrom showed that the modes themselves drift on the timescale of a year, fundamentally limiting our ability to detect exoplanets around $\beta$ Pictoris via pulsation timing.

 - **Abstract**
 Stochastic backgrounds of gravitational waves from primordial first-order phase transitions are a key probe of physics beyond the Standard Model. They represent one of the best prospects for observing or constraining new physics with the LISA gravitational wave observatory. However, the large foreground population of galactic binaries in the same frequency range represents a challenge, and will hinder the recovery of a stochastic background. To test the recoverability of a stochastic gravitational wave background, we use the LISA Simulation Suite to generate data incorporating both a stochastic background and an annually modulated foreground modelling the galactic binary population, and the Bayesian analysis code Cobaya to attempt to recover the model parameters. By applying the Deviance Information Criterion to compare models with and without a stochastic background we place bounds on the detectability of gravitational waves from first-order phase transitions. By further comparing models with and without the annual modulation, we show that exploiting the modulation improves the goodness-of-fit and gives a modest improvement to the bounds on detectable models.

          Effect of time-varying X-ray emission from stellar flares on the ionization of protoplanetary disks

 - **Abstract**
 X-rays have significant impacts on cold, weakly ionized protoplanetary disks by increasing the ionization rate and driving chemical reactions. Stellar flares are explosions that emit intense X-rays and are the unique source of hard X-rays with an energy of $\gtrsim10$ keV in the protoplanetary disk systems. Hard X-rays should be carefully taken into account in models as they can reach the disk midplane as a result of scattering in the disk atmospheres. However, previous models are insufficient to predict the hard X-ray spectra because of the simplification in flare models. We develop a model of X-ray spectra of stellar flares based on observations and flare theories. The flare temperature and nonthermal electron emissions are modeled as functions of flare energy, which allows us to better predict the hard X-ray photon flux than before. Using our X-ray model, we conduct radiative transfer calculations to investigate the impact of flare hard X-rays on disk ionization, with a particular focus on the protoplanetary disk around a T Tauri star. We demonstrate that for a flare with an energy of $\geq 10^{33}$ erg, X-ray photons with $\gtrsim 10$ keV penetrate down to the midplane to increase the ionization rates more than galactic cosmic rays. We also find that the 10-year-averaged X-rays from multiple flares could certainly contribute to the ionization at the disk midplane. These results emphasize the importance of stellar flares on the disk evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The circular polarization of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) is a key observable for characterising the origin of the signal detected by Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations. Both the astrophysical and the cosmological SGWB can have a sizeable amount of circular polarization, due to Poisson fluctuations in the source properties for the former, and to parity violating processes in the early universe for the latter. Its measurement is challenging since PTA are blind to the circular polarization monopole, forcing us to turn to anisotropies for detection. We study the sensitivity of current and future PTA datasets to circular polarization anisotropies, focusing on realistic modelling of intrinsic and kinematic anisotropies for astrophysical and cosmological scenarios respectively. Our results indicate that the expected level of circular polarization for the astrophysical SGWB should be within the reach of near future datasets, while for cosmological SGWB circular polarization is a viable target for more advanced SKA-type experiments.

          Unraveling Trace Anomaly of Supradense Matter via Neutron Star Compactness Scaling

 - **Abstract**
 The trace anomaly $\Delta\equiv 1/3-P/\varepsilon$ quantifies the possibly broken conformal symmetry in supradense matter under pressure $P$ at energy density $\varepsilon$. Perturbative QCD (pQCD) predicts a vanishing $\Delta$ at extremely high energy or baryon densities when the conformal symmetry is realized but its behavior at intermediate densities reachable in neutron stars (NSs) are still very uncertain. The extraction of $\Delta$ from NS observations strongly depends on the employed model for nuclear Equation of State (EOS). Based on the analytical results from perturbatively analyzing the dimensionless Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations that are further verified numerically by using $10^5$ EOSs generated randomly with a meta-model in a very broad EOS parameter space constrained by terrestrial nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations, here we first show that the compactness $\xi\equiv M_{\rm{NS}}/R$ of a NS with mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$ and radius $R$ scales very accurately with $\Pi_{\rm{c}}\equiv\mathrm{X}/(1+3\mathrm{X}^2+4\mathrm{X})$ where $\mathrm{X}\equiv P_{\rm{c}}/\varepsilon_{\rm{c}}$ is the ratio of pressure over energy density at NS centers. The scaling of NS compactness thus enables one to readily read off the central trace anomaly $\Delta_{\rm{c}}=1/3-\mathrm{X}$ directly from the observational data of either the mass-radius or red-shift measurements. We then demonstrate indeed that the available NS data themselves from recent X-ray and gravitational wave observations can determine model-independently the trace anomaly as a function of energy density in NS cores, providing a stringent test of existing NS models and a clear guidance in a new direction for further understanding the nature and EOS of supradense matter.

 - **Abstract**
 First-order primordial curvature perturbations are known to induce gravitational waves at the second-order, which can in turn probe the small-scale curvature perturbations near the end of the inflation. In this work, we extend the previous analysis in the Gaussian case into the non-Gaussian case, with particular efforts to obtain some thumb rules of sandwiching the associated peaks in gravitational waves induced from multiple peaks of non-Gaussian curvature perturbations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present $griz$ photometric light curves for the full 5 years of the Dark Energy Survey Supernova program (DES-SN), obtained with both forced Point Spread Function (PSF) photometry on Difference Images (DIFFIMG) performed during survey operations, and Scene Modelling Photometry (SMP) on search images processed after the survey. This release contains $31,636$ DIFFIMG and $19,706$ high-quality SMP light curves, the latter of which contains $1635$ photometrically-classified supernovae that pass cosmology quality cuts. This sample spans the largest redshift ($z$) range ever covered by a single SN survey ($0.1<z<1.13$) and is the largest single sample from a single instrument of SNe ever used for cosmological constraints. We describe in detail the improvements made to obtain the final DES-SN photometry and provide a comparison to what was used in the DES-SN3YR spectroscopically-confirmed SN Ia sample. We also include a comparative analysis of the performance of the SMP photometry with respect to the real-time DIFFIMG forced photometry and find that SMP photometry is more precise, more accurate, and less sensitive to the host-galaxy surface brightness anomaly. The public release of the light curves and ancillary data can be found at this https URL. Finally, we discuss implications for future transient surveys, such as the forthcoming Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).

 - **Abstract**
 We report constraints on a variety of non-standard cosmological models using the full 5-year photometrically-classified type Ia supernova sample from the Dark Energy Survey (DES-SN5YR). Both Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Suspiciousness calculations find no strong evidence for or against any of the non-standard models we explore. When combined with external probes, the AIC and Suspiciousness agree that 11 of the 15 models are moderately preferred over Flat-$\Lambda$CDM suggesting additional flexibility in our cosmological models may be required beyond the cosmological constant. We also provide a detailed discussion of all cosmological assumptions that appear in the DES supernova cosmology analyses, evaluate their impact, and provide guidance on using the DES Hubble diagram to test non-standard models. An approximate cosmological model, used to perform bias corrections to the data holds the biggest potential for harbouring cosmological assumptions. We show that even if the approximate cosmological model is constructed with a matter density shifted by $\Delta\Omega_m\sim0.2$ from the true matter density of a simulated data set the bias that arises is sub-dominant to statistical uncertainties. Nevertheless, we present and validate a methodology to reduce this bias.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a precise measurement of cosmological time dilation using the light curves of 1504 type Ia supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey spanning a redshift range $0.1\lesssim z\lesssim 1.2$. We find that the width of supernova light curves is proportional to $(1+z)$, as expected for time dilation due to the expansion of the Universe. Assuming type Ia supernovae light curves are emitted with a consistent duration $\Delta t_{\rm em}$, and parameterising the observed duration as $\Delta t_{\rm obs}=\Delta t_{\rm em}(1+z)^b$, we fit for the form of time dilation using two methods. Firstly, we find that a power of $b \approx 1$ minimises the flux scatter in stacked subsamples of light curves across different redshifts. Secondly, we fit each target supernova to a stacked light curve (stacking all supernovae with observed bandpasses matching that of the target light curve) and find $b=1.003\pm0.005$ (stat) $\pm\,0.010$ (sys). Thanks to the large number of supernovae and large redshift-range of the sample, this analysis gives the most precise measurement of cosmological time dilation to date, ruling out any non-time-dilating cosmological models at very high significance.

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of a Type Ic supernova (SN Ic) and its host galaxy (JADES-GS+53.13533-27.81457) at $z = 2.83$. This SN (named SN 2023adta) was identified in deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) Program. Follow-up observations with JWST/NIRSpec provided a spectroscopic redshift of $z = 2.83$ and the classification as a SN Ic-BL. The light curve of SN 2023adta matches well with other stripped envelope supernovae and we find a high peak luminosity, $M_V = -19.0 \pm 0.2$ mag, based on the distribution of best-fit SNe. The broad absorption features in its spectrum are consistent with other SNe Ic-BL 1-3 weeks after peak brightness. We measure a Ca II NIR triplet expansion velocity of $29{,}000 \pm 2{,}000$ km s$^{-1}$. The host galaxy of SN 2023adta is irregular, and modeling of its spectral energy distribution (SED) indicates a metallicity of $Z = 0.35^{+0.16}_{-0.08} Z_{\odot}$. This environment is consistent with the population of low-$z$ SNe Ic-BL which prefer lower metallicities relative to other stripped envelope supernovae, and track long duration $\gamma$-ray burst (LGRB) environments. We do not identify any GRBs that are coincident with SN 2023adta. Given the rarity of SNe Ic-BL in the local universe, the detection of a SN Ic-BL at $z = 2.83$ could indicate that their rates are enhanced at high redshift.

          Pulsar Timing Arrays require hierarchical models

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar Timing Array projects have found evidence of a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWB) using data from an ensemble of pulsars. In the literature, minimal assumptions are made about the signal and noise processes that affect data from these pulsars, such as pulsar spin noise. These assumptions are encoded as uninformative priors in Bayesian searches, though Frequentist approaches make similar assumptions. Uninformative priors are not suitable for (noise) properties of pulsars in an ensemble, and they bias estimates of model parameters such as gravitational-wave signal parameters. Both Frequentist and Bayesian searches are affected. In this letter, more appropriate priors are proposed in the language of Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling, where the properties of the ensemble of pulsars are jointly described with the properties of the individual components of the ensemble. Results by Pulsar Timing Array projects should be re-evaluated using Hierarchical Models.

 We present the JWST discovery of SN 2023adsy, a transient object located in a host galaxy JADES-GS$+53.13485$$-$$27.82088$ with a host spectroscopic redshift of $2.903\pm0.007$. The transient was identified in deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. Photometric and spectroscopic followup with NIRCam and NIRSpec, respectively, confirm the redshift and yield UV-NIR light-curve, NIR color, and spectroscopic information all consistent with a Type Ia classification. Despite its classification as a likely SN Ia, SN 2023adsy is both fairly red (E(B-V)$\sim0.9$) despite a host galaxy with low-extinction and has a high Ca II velocity ($19,000\pm2,000$km/s) compared to the general population of SNe Ia. While these characteristics are consistent with some Ca-rich SNe Ia, particularly SN 2016hnk, SN 2023adsy is intrinsically brighter than the low-z Ca-rich population. Although such an object is too red for any low-z cosmological sample, we apply a fiducial standardization approach to SN 2023adsy and find that the SN 2023adsy luminosity distance measurement is in excellent agreement ($\lesssim1\sigma$) with $\Lambda$CDM. Therefore unlike low-z Ca-rich SNe Ia, SN 2023adsy is standardizable and gives no indication that SN Ia standardized luminosities change significantly with redshift. A larger sample of distant SNe Ia is required to determine if SN Ia population characteristics at high-z truly diverge from their low-z counterparts, and to confirm that standardized luminosities nevertheless remain constant with redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 We study how eccentricity affects the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. We develop a fast and accurate semi-analytic method for computing the GW spectra, the distribution for the spectral fluctuations and the correlations between different frequencies. As GW emission circularizes binaries, the suppression of the signal strength due to eccentricity will be relevant for signals from wider binaries emitting at lower frequencies. Such a feature is present in the signal observed at pulsar timing arrays. We find that, when orbital decay of the SMBH binaries is driven by GWs only, the shape of the observed signal prefers highly eccentric binaries $\langle e \rangle_{2\,{\rm nHz}} = 0.83^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$. However, when environmental effects are included, the initial eccentricity can be significantly lowered yet the scenario with purely circular binaries is mildly disfavored.
