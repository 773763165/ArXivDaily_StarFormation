 - **Abstract**
 SCALES (Slicer Combined with Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy) is a 2 - 5 micron high-contrast lenslet-based integral field spectrograph (IFS) designed to characterize exoplanets and their atmospheres. The SCALES medium-spectral-resolution mode uses a lenslet subarray with a 0.34 x 0.36 arcsecond field of view which allows for exoplanet characterization at increased spectral resolution. We explore the sensitivity limitations of this mode by simulating planet detections in the presence of realistic noise sources. We use the SCALES simulator scalessim to generate high-fidelity mock observations of planets that include speckle noise from their host stars, as well as other atmospheric and instrumental noise effects. We employ both angular and reference differential imaging as methods of disentangling speckle noise from the injected planet signals. These simulations allow us to assess the feasibility of speckle deconvolution for SCALES medium resolution data, and to test whether one approach outperforms another based on planet angular separations and contrasts.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar dust at high Galactic latitudes can influence astronomical foreground subtraction, produce diffuse scattered light, and result in harder (de-reddened) ultraviolet spectra of quasars. In a sample of 94 quasars at high latitude and low extinction, we evaluate the interstellar "gas-to-dust ratio", $N_{\rm H}/E(B-V)$, using hydrogen column densities (H I and H$_2$) and far-infrared estimates of dust reddening. In the Galactic plane, this ratio is $6.0\pm0.2$ (in units of $10^{21}~{\rm cm}^{-2}~{\rm mag}^{-1}$). In a sub-sample of 51 quasars with measurements of both H I and H$_2$ and $0.01 \leq E(B-V) \lesssim 0.1$, we find mean ratios $10.3\pm0.4$ (gas at all velocities) and $9.2\pm0.3$ (low velocity only). Including H$_2$ increases $N_{\rm H}$ by $\sim10$%, even at high latitude. On average, recent Planck estimates of $E(B-V)$ in low reddening sight lines are 12% higher than those from Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011), and $N_{\rm HI}$ exhibits significant variations when measured at different radio telescopes. We also show that $E(B-V)$ is sensitive to far-infrared modeled dust temperature $T_d$ and emissivity index $\beta$. Consequently, gas-to-dust ratios have large, asymmetric errors at low $E(B-V)$. The ratios are elevated in sight lines with high-velocity clouds, which contribute $N_{\rm H}$ but little reddening. In Complex C, the ratio decreases by 40% when high velocity gas is excluded. Decreases in dust content are expected in low-metallicity gas above the Galactic plane, resulting from grain destruction in shocks, settling to the disk, and thermal sputtering in hot halo gas.

 - **Abstract**
 In 2016 the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) had a successful 46-day flight onboard NASA's Super Pressure Balloon platform. In this work we report measurements of the Galactic diffuse continuum emission (GDCE) observed towards the inner Galaxy during the flight, which in the COSI energy band (0.2 - 5 MeV) is primarily generated from inverse Compton radiation. Within uncertainties we find overall good agreement with previous measurements from INTEGRAL/SPI and COMPTEL. Based on these initial findings, we discuss the potential for further probing the GDCE with the 2016 COSI balloon data, as well as prospects for the upcoming satellite mission.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) perform Bayesian posterior inference with expensive MCMC methods. Given a dataset of ~10-100 pulsars and O(10^3) timing residuals each, producing a posterior distribution for the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) can take days to a week. The computational bottleneck arises because the likelihood evaluation required for MCMC is extremely costly when considering the dimensionality of the search space. Fortunately, generating simulated data is fast, so modern simulation-based inference techniques can be brought to bear on the problem. In this paper, we demonstrate how conditional normalizing flows trained on simulated data can be used for extremely fast and accurate estimation of the SGWB posteriors, reducing the sampling time from weeks to a matter of seconds.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic neutrinos, with energies above 100~PeV, could be finally discovered in the near future. Measuring their flavor composition would reveal information about their production and propagation, but it is unclear if planned UHE neutrino telescopes will have the capabilities to do it. We circumvent this by proposing a new way to measure the UHE neutrino flavor composition that does not rely on individual telescopes having flavor-identification capabilities. We manufacture flavor sensitivity from the joint detection by one telescope sensitive to all flavors -- the radio array of IceCube-Gen2 -- and one mostly sensitive to $\nu_\tau$ -- GRAND. From this limited flavor sensitivity, predominantly to $\nu_\tau$, and even under conservative choices of neutrino flux and detector size, we extract important insight. For astrophysics, we forecast meaningful constraints on the neutrino production mechanism; for fundamental physics, vastly improved constraints on Lorentz-invariance violation. These are the first measurement forecasts of the UHE $\nu_\tau$ content.
#### Subaru High-$z$ Exploration of Low-luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs). XVII.  Black Hole Mass Distribution at $z \sim 6$ Estimated via Spectral Comparison  with Low-$z$ Quasars

 - **Abstract**
 We report the distribution of black hole (BH) masses and Eddingont ratios estimated for a sample of 131 low luminosity quasars in the early cosmic epoch ($5.6 < z < 7.0$). Our work is based on Subaru High-$z$ Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) project, which has constructed a low luminosity quasar sample down to $M_{1450} \sim - 21$ mag, exploiting the survey data of Hyper Suprime-Cam installed on Subaru Telescope. The discovery spectra of these quasars are limited to the rest-frame wavelengths of $\sim$ 1200 -- 1400 \AA, which contains no emission lines that can be used as BH mass estimators. In order to overcome this problem, we made use of low-$z$ counterpart spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which are spectrally matched to the high-$z$ spectra in overlapping wavelengths. We then combined the C~{\sc iv} emission line widths of the counterparts with the continuum luminosity from the SHELLQs data to estimate BH masses. The resulting BH mass distribution has a range of $\sim 10^{7-10} M_{\odot}$, with most of the quasars having BH masses $\sim 10^{8} M_{\odot}$ with sub-Eddington accretion. The present study provides not only a new insight into normal quasars in the reionization epoch, but also a new promising way to estimate BH masses of high-$z$ quasars without near-infrared spectroscopy.
#### Searching for Mass Concentrations with Precision Pulsar Timing

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12251
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.12251
 - **Abstract**
 This papers searches for evidence of mass concentrations along the path of radio pulses in the PPTA2 survey data release. Radio pulse travel times are influenced via gravitational fields along the path from the source to the observer. Transient time delays in transit are a useful measure of the matter distribution along the path. Many pulsars have very well understood timing solutions with predicable arrival times and can be used to sample the mass variation. Changes in the source, observer and mass concentration positions produce changes in arrival times which can be significant for precision pulsar times. Twelve candidates are reported from this search.
#### The population of Comet candidates among quasi-Hilda objects revisited  and updated

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.12253
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we perform a dynamical study of the population of objects in the unstable quasi-Hilda region. The aim of this work is to make an update of the population of quasi-Hilda comets (QHCs) that have recently arrived from the Centaurs region. To achieve our goal, we have applied a dynamical criteria to constrain the unstable quasi-Hilda region that allowed us to select 828 potential candidates. The orbital data of the potential candidates was take from the ASTORB database and we apply backward integration to search by those that have recently arrived from the outer regions of the Solar System. Then we studied the dynamical evolution of the candidates from a statistical point of view by calculating the time-averaged distribution of a number of clones of each candidate as a function of aphelion and perihelion distances. We found that 47 objects could have been recently injected into the inner Solar System from the Centaur or transneptunian regions. These objects may have preserved volatile material and are candidates to exhibit cometary activity.

 - **Abstract**
 The complex chemistry that occurs in star-forming regions can provide insight into the formation of prebiotic molecules at various evolutionary stages of star formation. To study this process, we present millimeter-wave interferometric observations of the neighboring hot cores W3(H$_2$O) and W3(OH) carried out using the NOEMA interferometer. We have analyzed distributions of six molecules that account for most observed lines across both cores and have constructed physical parameter maps for rotational temperature, column density, and velocity field with corresponding uncertainties. We discuss the derived spatial distributions of these parameters in the context of the physical structure of the source. We propose the use of HCOOCH$_3$ as a new temperature tracer in W3(H$_2$O) and W3(OH) in addition to the more commonly used CH$_3$CN. By analyzing the physically-derived parameters for each molecule across both W3(H$_2$O) and W3(OH), the work presented herein further demonstrates the impact of physical environment on hot cores at different evolutionary stages.
#### Overview of the EUSO-SPB2 Target of Opportunity program using the  Cherenkov Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 During the Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) mission, we planned Target of Opportunity (ToO) operations to follow up on possible sources of $\gtrsim 10 \, {\rm PeV}$ neutrinos. The original plan before flight was to point the onboard Cherenkov Telescope (CT) to catch the source's path on the sky just below Earth's horizon. By using the Earth as a tau-neutrino to tau-lepton converter, the CT would then be able to look for optical extensive air shower signals induced by tau-lepton decays in the atmosphere. The CT had a field of view of $6.4^\circ$ vertical $\times$ $12.8^\circ$ horizontal. Possible neutrino source candidates include gamma ray bursts, tidal disruption events and other bursting or flaring sources. In addition, follow-ups of binary neutron star mergers would have been possible after the start of the O4 observation run from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. The resulting exposure is modeled using the NuSpaceSim framework in ToO mode. With the launch of the EUSO-SPB2 payload on the 13th May 2023, this summarizes the ToO program status and preliminary data, as available.
#### Updated reference wavelengths for Si VII and Mg VII lines in the 272-281  Angstrom range
 - **Authors:** Peter R. Young

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12313
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.12313
 - **Abstract**
 New reference wavelengths for atomic transitions of Mg VII and Si VII in the 272-281 A wavelength range are derived using measurements from the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on board the Hinode spacecraft. Mg VII and Si VII are important ions for measuring plasma properties in the solar transition region at around 0.6 MK. The six Si VII wavelengths are 13--21 mA and 7--11 mA longer than the values in the NIST Atomic Spectra Database (ASD) and the compilations of B. Edlen, respectively. The four Mg VII wavelengths are shorter than the values in the ASD by 8-12 mA but show reasonable agreement with the Edlen values. The new wavelengths will lead to more accurate Doppler shift measurements from the EIS instrument, and will be valuable for spectral disambiguation modeling for the upcoming Multi-Slit Solar Explorer mission.

 - **Abstract**
 RZ Piscium (RZ Psc) is well-known in the variable star field because of its numerous, irregular optical dips in the past five decades, but the nature of the system is heavily debated in the literature. We present multiyear infrared monitoring data from Spitzer and WISE to track the activities of the inner debris production, revealing stochastic infrared variability as short as weekly timescales that is consistent with destroying a 90-km-size asteroid every year. ALMA 1.3 mm data combined with spectral energy distribution modeling show that the disk is compact ($\sim$0.1--13 au radially) and lacks cold gas. The disk is found to be highly inclined and has a significant vertical scale height. These observations confirm that RZ Psc hosts a close to edge-on, highly perturbed debris disk possibly due to migration of recently formed giant planets which might be triggered by the low-mass companion RZ Psc B if the planets formed well beyond the snowlines.

 - **Abstract**
 The size of the optics used in observatories is often limited by fabrication, metrology, and handling technology, but having a large primary mirror provides significant benefits for scientific research. The evolution of rocket launch options enables heavy payload carrying on orbit and outstretching the telescope's form-factor choices. Moreover, cost per launch is lower than the traditional flight method, which is obviously advantageous for various novel space observatory concepts. The University of Arizona has successfully fabricated many large-scale primary optics for ground-based observatories including the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT, 8.4 meter diameter two primary mirrors), Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (now renamed to Vera C. Rubin Observatory, 8.4 meter diameter monolithic primary and tertiary mirror), and the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT, 8.4 meter diameter primary mirror seven segments). Launching a monolithic primary mirror into space could bypass many of the difficulties encountered during the assembly and deployment of the segmented primary mirrors. However, it might bring up unprecedented challenges and hurdles, also. We explore and foresee the expected challenges and evaluate them. To estimate the tolerance and optical error budget of a large optical system in space such as three mirror anastigmat telescope, we have developed a methodology that considers various errors from design, fabrication, assembly, and environmental factors.

 - **Abstract**
 Much of the exoplanet discovery efforts over the next several years are largely tasked with finding candidates for the upcoming Ariel mission. This is a role that TESS is well-suited for. Radial velocity follow-up is needed to confirm the planetary nature of these systems, as many of its planet candidates turn out to be eclipsing binary systems with small stellar secondaries. Focused Doppler follow-up to obtain these radial velocities is expensive. The Gaia mission's radial velocity measurements on its target stars are not adequately precise for a general search for orbiting planetary companions. While the RV data has yielded thousands of spectroscopic binary systems, only an extreme minority of these reach into the planetary-mass regime. Nonetheless, they do detect eclipsing binary systems that can masquerade as transiting hot Jupiters. In this work, we compare the Gaia DR3 Non-Single Stars catalogue to the current planet candidate list from TESS and determine several of these candidate planetary systems are actually eclipsing binaries. We find $\sim130$ eclipsing binaries among the TOI and EPIC lists that do not appear to be in the literature, including the previously statistically validated planet K2-256 b. This work illustrates the usefulness of \textit{Gaia} to exoplanet validation efforts and will help guide follow-up efforts for discovering new transiting planets for the Ariel mission by avoiding misdirecting valuable telescope time.
#### Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk). VIII. A Small  Protostellar Disk around the Extremely Low-Mass and Young Class 0 Protostar,  IRAS 15398-3359

 - **Abstract**
 Protostellar disks are a ubiquitous part of the star formation process and the future sites of planet formation. As part of the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) large program, we present high-angular resolution dust continuum ($\sim40\,$mas) and molecular line ($\sim150\,$mas) observations of the Class 0 protostar, IRAS 15398-3359. The dust continuum is small, compact, and centrally peaked, while more extended dust structures are found in the outflow directions. We perform a 2D Gaussian fitting to find the deconvolved size and $2\sigma$ radius of the dust disk to be $4.5\times2.8\,\mathrm{au}$ and $3.8\,\mathrm{au}$, respectively. We estimate the gas+dust disk mass assuming optically thin continuum emission to be $0.6-1.8\,M_\mathrm{jup}$, indicating a very low-mass disk. The CO isotopologues trace components of the outflows and inner envelope, while SO traces a compact, rotating disk-like component. Using several rotation curve fittings on the PV diagram of the SO emission, the lower limits of the protostellar mass and gas disk radius are $0.022\,M_\odot$ and $31.2\,\mathrm{au}$ from our Modified 2 single power-law fitting. A conservative upper limit of the protostellar mass is inferred to be $0.1\,M_\odot$. The protostellar mass-accretion rate and the specific angular momentum at the protostellar disk edge are found to be between $1.3-6.1\times10^{-6}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ and $1.2-3.8\times10^{-4}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,pc}$, respectively, with an age estimated between $0.4-7.5\times10^{4}\,$yr. At this young age with no clear substructures in the disk, planet formation would likely not yet have started. This study highlights the importance of high-resolution observations and systematic fitting procedures when deriving dynamical properties of deeply embedded Class 0 protostars.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the confirmation of a sub-Saturn-size exoplanet, TOI-1194 b with a mass about $0.456_{-0.051}^{+0.055}$ $M_{J}$, and a very low mass companion star with a mass of about $96.5\pm1.5$ $M_J$, TOI-1251 B. Exoplanet candidates provided by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) are suitable for further follow-up observations by ground-based telescopes with small and medium apertures. The analysis is performed based on data from several telescopes worldwide, including telescopes in the Sino-German multiband photometric campaign, which aimed at confirming TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) using ground-based small-aperture and medium-aperture telescopes, especially for long-period targets. TOI-1194 b is confirmed based on the consistent periodic transits depths from the multiband photometric data. We measure an orbital period of $2.310644\pm0.000001$ d, and radius is $0.767_{-0.041}^{+0.045}$ $R_J$, and amplitude of RV curve is $69.4_{-7.3}^{+7.9}$ m/s. TOI-1251 B is confirmed based on the multiband photometric and high-resolution spectroscopic data, whose orbiting period is $5.963054_{-0.000001}^{+0.000002}$ d, the radius is $0.947_{-0.033}^{+0.035}$ $R_J$, and amplitude of RV curve is $9849_{-40}^{+42}$ m/s.

 - **Abstract**
 The Slicer Combined with Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy (SCALES) instrument is a lenslet-based integral field spectrograph that will operate at 2 to 5 microns, imaging and characterizing colder (and thus older) planets than current high-contrast instruments. Its spatial resolution for distant science targets and/or close-in disks and companions could be improved via interferometric techniques such as sparse aperture masking. We introduce a nascent Python package, NRM-artist, that we use to design several SCALES masks to be non-redundant and to have uniform coverage in Fourier space. We generate high-fidelity mock SCALES data using the scalessim package for SCALES' low spectral resolution modes across its 2 to 5 micron bandpass. We include realistic noise from astrophysical and instrument sources, including Keck adaptive optics and Poisson noise. We inject planet and disk signals into the mock datasets and subsequently recover them to test the performance of SCALES sparse aperture masking and to determine the sensitivity of various mask designs to different science signals.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of inelastic collisions between dark matter (DM) and heavy cosmic ray (CR) nuclei on CR propagation. We approximate the fragmentation cross-sections for DM-CR collisions using collider-measured proton-nuclei scattering cross-sections, allowing us to assess how these collisions affect the spectra of CR Boron and Carbon. We derive new CR spectra from DM-CR collisions by incorporating these DM-CR cross-sections into the source terms and solving the diffusion equation for the complete network of reactions involved in generating secondary species. Utilizing the latest data from AMS-02 and DAMPE on the Boron-to-Carbon ratio, we estimate a 95\% upper limit for the effective inelastic cross-section of DM-proton as a function of DM mass. Our findings reveal that at $m_\chi \simeq 2 \,\rm{MeV}$, the effective inelastic cross-section between DM and protons must be less than $\mathcal{O}(10^{-32})~{\rm cm}^2$.

 Machine learning has rapidly become a tool of choice for the astronomical community. It is being applied across a wide range of wavelengths and problems, from the classification of transients to neural network emulators of cosmological simulations, and is shifting paradigms about how we generate and report scientific results. At the same time, this class of method comes with its own set of best practices, challenges, and drawbacks, which, at present, are often reported on incompletely in the astrophysical literature. With this paper, we aim to provide a primer to the astronomical community, including authors, reviewers, and editors, on how to implement machine learning models and report their results in a way that ensures the accuracy of the results, reproducibility of the findings, and usefulness of the method.

 - **Abstract**
 The standard approach to obtaining knowledge about the properties of the surface layer of a comet from observations of gas production consists of two stages. First, various thermophysical models are used to calculate gas production for a few sets of parameters. Second, a comparison of observations and theoretical predictions is performed. This approach is complicated because the values of many model characteristics are known only approximately. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the sensitivity of the simulated outgassing to variations in the properties of the surface layer. This problem was recently considered by us for aggregates up to tens of microns in size. For millimetre-size aggregates, a qualitative extension of the method used to model the structural characteristics of the layer is required. It is also necessary to study the role of radiative thermal conductivity, which may play an important role for such large particles. We investigated layers constructed from large aggregates and having various thicknesses and porosity and evaluated the effective sublimation of water ice at different heliocentric distances. For radiative conductivity, approximate commonly used models and the complicated model based on the Dense Medium Radiative Transfer theory were compared. It was shown that for millimetre-size aggregates careful consideration of the radiative thermal conductivity is required since this mechanism of energy transfer may change the resulting gas productivity by several times. We demonstrate that our model is more realistic for an evolved comet than simple models parameterising the properties of the cometary surface layer, yet maintains comparable computational complexity.

 - **Abstract**
 The observation of interstellar objects 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov suggests the existence of a larger population of smaller projectiles that impact our planet with unbound orbits. We analyze an asteroidal grazing meteor (FH1) recorded by the Finnish Fireball Network on October 23, 2022. FH1 displayed a likely hyperbolic orbit lying on the ecliptic plane with an estimated velocity excess of $\sim$0.7 km$\,$s$^{-1}$ at impact. FH1 may either be an interstellar object, indicating a high-strength bias in this population, or an Oort cloud object, which would reinforce migration-based solar system models. Furthermore, under the calculated uncertainties, FH1 could potentially be associated with the passage of Scholz's binary star system. Statistical evaluation of uncertainties in the CNEOS database and study of its hyperbolic fireballs reveals an anisotropic geocentric radiant distribution and low orbital inclinations, challenging the assumption of a randomly incoming interstellar population. Orbital integrations suggest that the event on March 9, 2017 (IM2) from CNEOS may have experienced gravitational perturbation during the Scholz fly-by, contingent upon velocity overestimation within the expected range. These findings suggest that apparent interstellar meteors may, in fact, be the result of accelerated meteoroid impacts caused by close encounters with massive objects within or passing through our solar system.
#### A modified lognormal approximation of the Lyman-$α$ forest:  comparison with full hydrodynamic simulations at $2\leq z\leq 2.7$

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in distant quasar spectra with upcoming surveys are expected to provide significantly larger and higher-quality datasets. To interpret these datasets, it is imperative to develop efficient simulations. One such approach is based on the assumption that baryonic densities in the intergalactic medium (IGM) follow a lognormal distribution. We extend our earlier work to assess the robustness of the lognormal model of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in recovering the parameters characterizing IGM state, namely, the mean-density IGM temperature ($T_0$), the slope of the temperature-density relation ($\gamma$), and the hydrogen photoionization rate ($\Gamma_{12}$), by comparing with high-resolution Sherwood SPH simulations across the redshift range $2 \leq z \leq 2.7$. These parameters are estimated through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique, using the mean and power spectrum of the transmitted flux. We find that the usual lognormal distribution of IGM densities cannot recover the parameters of the SPH simulations. This limitation arises from the fact that the SPH baryonic density distribution cannot be described by a simple lognormal form. To address this, we extend the model by scaling the linear density contrast by a parameter $\nu$. While the resulting baryonic density is still lognormal, the additional parameter gives us extra freedom in setting the variance of density fluctuations. With this extension, values of $T_0$ and $\gamma$ implied in the SPH simulations are recovered at $\sim 1-\sigma$ ($\lesssim$ 10%) of the median (best-fit) values for most redshifts bins. However, this extended lognormal model cannot recover $\Gamma_{12}$ reliably, with the best-fit value discrepant by $\gtrsim 3-\sigma$ for $z > 2.2$. Despite this limitation in the recovery of $\Gamma_{12}$, we argue that the model remains useful for constraining cosmological parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 The carbonaceous Bencubbin-like (CB), high-metal (CH), and Renazzo-like (CR) chondrites are metal-rich chondrites that have been suggested to be genetically linked and are sometimes grouped together as the CR chondrite clan. Of these, the CB and CH chondrites are thought to have formed in an impact-generated vapor-melt plume from material that may be isotopically akin to CR chondrites. We report Mo, Ti, Cr, and Hf-W isotopic data for CB and CH chondrites in order to determine their formation time, to assess whether these chondrites are genetically related, and to evaluate their potential link to CR chondrites. An internal Hf-W isochron for the CH chondrite Acfer 182 yields an age of 3.8 +- 1.2 Ma after the formation of Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs), which is indistinguishable from the mean Hf-W model age for CB metal of 3.8 +- 1.3 Ma. The Mo isotopic data for CB and CH chondrites indicate that both contain some of the same metal and silicate components, which themselves are isotopically distinct. As such, the different Mo isotopic compositions of bulk CB and CH chondrites reflect their distinct metal-to-silicate ratios. CR metal exhibits the same Mo isotopic composition as CB and CH metal, but CR silicates have distinct Mo and Ti isotopic compositions compared to CB and CH silicates, indicating that CB/CH chondrites may be genetically related to CR metal, but not to CR silicates. Together, the new isotopic data are consistent with formation of CB and CH chondrites in different regions of a common impact-generated vapor- melt plume and suggest that the CB and CH metal may derive from a metal-rich precursor genetically linked to CR chondrites. The Hf-W systematics of CH and CB chondrites indicate that the impact occurred at 3.8 +- 0.8 Ma after the formation of Ca-Al-rich inclusions and, hence, up to ~1 Ma earlier than previously inferred based on Pb- Pb chronology.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical fingerprint of a planet reveals information about its formation history regarding when and where it formed. The water content of a planet can help to constrain its formation pathway: If the planet formed in the outer regions of the disk and migrated inward, it will be water-rich due to the accretion of water-ice-rich solids. Conversely, formation in the inner disk, where water-ice is not available, will result in a smaller atmospheric water content due to the limited accretion of water vapor. This process complicates with the presence of gap-opening giant planets. A gas giant exerts a pressure bump exterior to its orbit, preventing the further influx of pebbles into the inner system, resulting in a water-poor environment. The different formation scenarios can help to constrain the formation of the HAT-P-11 system, which contains an inner sub-Neptune with a mass of 23.4 $\mathrm{M_{\oplus}}$ and substellar water abundances ($X_\mathrm{H_2O} \approx 0.11$), as well as an outer giant planet orbiting exterior to the water-ice line. Our planet formation model encompasses planetary growth through pebble and gas accretion, along with a pebble drift and evaporation module that enables us to track the chemical composition of the disk and the planets. We find that the presence of the gas giant is necessary to block water-ice-rich material, resulting in a substellar water content for the inner sub-Neptune. If the giant planet forms too early, not enough solid material can enter the inner disk regions, preventing the efficient growth of the inner planet. This highlights the importance of the timing of giant planet formation to explain the inner system structure. Our simulations predict a roughly stellar C/O ratio with superstellar C/H and O/H for HAT-P-11b, providing constraints for future observations that are essential for gaining a more detailed understanding of its formation.

 - **Abstract**
 It is commonly believed that accretion discs are truncated and their inner regions are described by advection dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) in the hard spectral state of black hole X-ray binaries. However, the increasing occurrence of a relativistically blurred Fe K$\alpha$ line together with a hard continuum points to the existence of a thin disc located near the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). Assuming the accretion in the hard state is via an ADAF extending to near 100 Schwarzschild radii, which is supplied by either a stellar wind from a companion star or resulting from an evaporated disc, we study the possible condensation of the hot gas during its accretion towards the black hole. It is found that a small fraction of the ADAF condenses into a cold disc as a consequence of efficient radiative cooling at small distances, forming a disc-corona configuration near the ISCO. This takes place for low accretion rates corresponding to luminosities ranging from $\sim 10^{-3}$ to a few per cent of the Eddington luminosity. The coexistence of the weak inner disc and the dominant hot accretion flow provides a natural explanation of the broad K$\alpha$ line in the hard state. Detailed computations demonstrate that such accretion flows produce a hard X-ray spectrum accompanied by a weak disc component with a negative correlation between the 2-10 keV photon index and the Eddington ratio. The predicted spectrum of Cygnus X-1 and the correlation between the photon index and the Eddington ratio are in good agreement with observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), namely binary systems composed of a massive black hole and a compact stellar-mass object, are anticipated to be among the gravitational wave (GW) sources detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Similarly to compact binary mergers detected by current GW detectors, EMRIs can be used as cosmic rulers to probe the expansion of the Universe. Motivated by tensions in current cosmological observations as well as by alternative models of dark energy, modified gravity theories can affect the propagation of GWs across cosmological distances, with modifications commonly parametrised in terms of two phenomenological parameters, $\Xi_0$ and $n$. In this work we adopt a Bayesian approach to constrain for the first time parametrised deviations from General Relativity using the loudest simulated EMRIs detected by LISA as dark sirens with a simulated galaxy catalog. Assuming all the cosmological parameters except $\Xi_0$ are already tightly constrained, our forecasts show that $\Xi_0$ can be constrained to a few percent level (90% C.I.) with 4 years of LISA observations, unless EMRI detection rates turn out to be closer to current pessimistic expectations. These results quickly degrade if additional cosmological parameters are inferred simultaneously, but become more robust with an extended LISA observation period of 10 years. Overall, we find that EMRIs with LISA are better at constraining modified GW propagation than current second-generation ground-based GW detectors, but they will only be comparable to third-generation detectors in the most optimistic scenarios.

 As IceCube surpasses a decade of operation in the full detector configuration, results that drive forward the fields of neutrino astronomy, cosmic ray physics, multi-messenger astronomy, particle physics, and beyond continue to emerge at an accelerated pace. IceCube data is dominated by background events, and thus teasing out the signal is the common challenge to most analyses. Statistical accumulation of data, along with better understanding of the background fluxes, the detector, and continued development of our analysis tools have produced many profound results that were presented at ICRC2023. Highlights covered here include the first neutrino observation of the Galactic Plane, the first observation of a steady emission neutrino point source NGC1068, new characterizations of the cosmic ray flux and its secondary particles, and a possible new era in measuring the energy spectrum of the diffuse astrophysical flux. IceCube is poised to make more discoveries and drive fields forward in the near future with many novel analyses coming online.
#### A Two-component Jet Model for the TeV and Multi-wavelength Afterglows of  GRB 221009A

 - **Abstract**
 The TeV afterglow detected by LHAASO has been interpreted as arising from a narrow jet while the radio to X-ray afterglows are explained as arising from a wide structured jet. However, there is no model explaining the TeV and lower-energy multi-wavelength afterglows simultaneously. We here investigate a two-component jet model, including an inner narrow core and an outer wide wing with an angular structure, to explain both the early TeV afterglow and multi-wavelength afterglows that last up to 100 days. We find that the radio afterglow and the TeV upper limit imposed by H.E.S.S. observations combine to constrain the circum-burst density to be low at larger radii. Thus, a decreasing density profile with radius is favored. Considering that the rising TeV light curve during the afterglow onset favors a constant-density medium, we invoke a stratified density profile, including a constant-density profile at small radii and a wind density profile at large radii. We find that the two-component jet model with such a stratified density profile can explain the TeV, X-ray and optical afterglows of GRB 221009A, although the radio fluxes exceed the observed ones by a factor of two at later epochs. The discrepancy in the radio afterglow could be resolved by invoking some non-standard assumption about the microphysics of afterglow shocks, such as a decreasing fraction of accelerated particles with time. The total kinetic energy of the two components in our model is $\lesssim 10^{52}{\rm erg}$, significantly smaller than that in the single structured jet models.

 - **Abstract**
 The standard cosmological model predicts statistically isotropic cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations. However, several summary statistics of CMB isotropy have anomalous values, including: the low level of large-angle temperature correlations, $S_{1/2}$; the excess power in odd versus even low-$\ell$ multipoles, $R^{TT}$; the (low) variance of large-scale temperature anisotropies in the ecliptic north, but not the south, $\sigma^2_{16}$; and the alignment and planarity of the quadrupole and octopole of temperature, $S_{QO}$. Individually, their low $p$-values are weak evidence for violation of statistical isotropy. The correlations of the tail values of these statistics have not to this point been studied. We show that the joint probability of all four of these happening by chance in $\Lambda$CDM is likely $\leq3\times10^{-8}$. This constitutes more than $5\sigma$ evidence for violation of statistical isotropy.

 - **Abstract**
 The gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB~211211A is believed to have occurred due to the merger of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole, despite its duration of more than a minute. Subsequent analysis has revealed numerous interesting properties including the possible presence of a $\sim 22$~Hz quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) during precursor emission. Here we perform timing analysis of Fermi and Swift gamma-ray data on GRB~211211A and, although we do not find a strong QPO during the precursor, we do find an extremely significant 19.5~Hz flux oscillation, which has higher fractional amplitude at higher energies, in a $\sim 0.2$~second segment beginning $\sim 1.6$~seconds after the start of the burst. After presenting our analysis we discuss possible mechanisms for the oscillation.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we consider the potential of cometary impacts to deliver complex organic molecules and the prebiotic building blocks required for life to rocky exoplanets. Numerical experiments have demonstrated that for these molecules to survive, impacts at very low velocities are required. This work shows that for comets scattered from beyond the snow-line into the habitable zone, the minimum impact velocity is always lower for planets orbiting Solar-type stars than M-dwarfs. Using both an analytical model and numerical N-body simulations, we show that the lowest velocity impacts occur onto planets in tightly-packed planetary systems around high-mass (i.e. Solar-mass) stars, enabling the intact delivery of complex organic molecules. Impacts onto planets around low-mass stars are found to be very sensitive to the planetary architecture, with the survival of complex prebiotic molecules potentially impossible in loosely-packed systems. Rocky planets around M-dwarfs also suffer significantly more high velocity impacts, potentially posing unique challenges for life on these planets. In the scenario that cometary delivery is important for the origins of life, this study predicts the presence of biosignatures will be correlated with i) decreasing planetary mass (i.e. escape velocity), ii) increasing stellar-mass, and iii) decreasing planetary separation (i.e. exoplanets in tightly-packed systems).

 - **Abstract**
 The Near-Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor mission is a NASA observatory designed to discover and characterize near-Earth asteroids and comets. The mission's primary objective is to find the majority of objects large enough to cause severe regional impact damage ($>$140 m in effective spherical diameter) within its five-year baseline survey. Operating at the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrange point, the mission will survey to within 45 degrees of the Sun in an effort to find the objects in the most Earth-like orbits. The survey cadence is optimized to provide observational arcs long enough to reliably distinguish near-Earth objects from more distant small bodies that cannot pose an impact hazard. Over the course of its survey, NEO Surveyor will discover $\sim$200,000 - 300,000 new NEOs down to sizes as small as $\sim$10 m and thousands of comets, significantly improving our understanding of the probability of an Earth impact over the next century.

 - **Abstract**
 The Near Earth Object Surveyor mission has a requirement to find two-thirds of the potentially hazardous asteroids larger than 140 meters in size. In order to determine the mission's expected progress toward this goal during design and testing, as well as the actual progress during the survey, a simulation tool has been developed to act as a consistent and quantifiable yardstick. We test that the survey simulation software is correctly predicting on-sky positions and thermal infrared fluxes by using it to reproduce the published measurements of asteroids from the NEOWISE mission. We then extended this work to find previously unreported detections of known near Earth asteroids in the NEOWISE data archive, a search that resulted in 21,661 recovery detections, including 1,166 objects that had no previously reported NEOWISE observations. These efforts demonstrate the reliability of the NEOS Survey Simulator tool, and the perennial value of searchable image and source catalog archives for extending our knowledge of the small bodies of the Solar System.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent attempts to fully resolve the Hubble tension from early dark energy models seem to favor a primordial Harrison-Zeldovich Universe with its scalar spectrum being extremely scale invariant. Restoring the Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum within the single-field inflationary paradigm appears to be infeasible, turning to the multi-field approach from either curvaton or waterfall models. In this Letter, we successfully align with the Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum within a single-field chaotic inflation by a non-minimal derivative coupling, and the previously disfavoured chaotic potential by Planck+BICEP/Keck data in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model now returns back to the scope of future polarization observations of the cosmic microwave background.
#### Consistently constraining $f_{\rm NL}$ with the squeezed lensing  bispectrum using consistency relations

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a non-perturbative method to constrain the amplitude of local-type primordial non-Gaussianity ($f_{\rm NL}$) using squeezed configurations of the CMB lensing convergence and cosmic shear bispectra. First, we use cosmological consistency relations to derive a model for the squeezed limit of angular auto- and cross-bispectra of lensing convergence fields in the presence of $f_{\rm NL}$. Using this model, we perform a Fisher forecast with specifications expected for upcoming CMB lensing measurements from the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4, as well as cosmic shear measurements from a Rubin LSST/Euclid-like experiment. Assuming a minimum multipole $\ell_{\rm min}=10$ and maximum multipole $\ell_{\rm max}=1400$, we forecast $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}}=175$ ($95$) for Simons Observatory (CMB-S4). Our forecasts improve considerably for an LSST/Euclid-like cosmic shear experiment with three tomographic bins and $\ell_{\rm min}=10$ and $\ell_{\rm max}=1400$ ($5000$) with $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}}=31$ ($16$). A joint analysis of CMB-S4 lensing and LSST/Euclid-like shear yields little gain over the shear-only forecasts; however, we show that a joint analysis could be useful if the CMB lensing convergence can be reliably reconstructed at larger angular scales than the shear field. The method presented in this work is a novel and robust technique to constrain local primordial non-Gaussianity from upcoming large-scale structure surveys that is completely independent of the galaxy field (and therefore any nuisance parameters such as $b_\phi$), thus complementing existing techniques to constrain $f_{\rm NL}$ using the scale-dependent halo bias.
