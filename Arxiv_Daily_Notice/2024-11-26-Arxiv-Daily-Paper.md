          AKRA 2.0: Accurate Kappa Reconstruction Algorithm for masked shear catalog

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic shear surveys serve as a powerful tool for mapping the underlying matter density field, including non-visible dark matter. A key challenge in cosmic shear surveys is the accurate reconstruction of lensing convergence ($\kappa$) maps from shear catalogs impacted by survey boundaries and masks, which seminal Kaiser-Squires (KS) method are not designed to handle. To overcome these limitations, we previously proposed the Accurate Kappa Reconstruction Algorithm (AKRA), a prior-free maximum likelihood map-making method. Initially designed for flat sky scenarios with periodic boundary conditions, AKRA has proven successful in recovering high-precision $\kappa$ maps from masked shear catalogs. In this work, we upgrade AKRA to AKRA 2.0 by integrating the tools designed for spherical geometry. This upgrade employs spin-weighted spherical harmonic transforms to reconstruct the convergence field over the full sky. To optimize computational efficiency, we implement a scale-splitting strategy that segregates the analysis into two parts: large-scale analysis on the sphere (referred to as AKRA-sphere) and small-scale analysis on the flat sky (referred to as AKRA-flat); the results from both analyses are then combined to produce final reconstructed $\kappa$ map. We tested AKRA 2.0 using simulated shear catalogs with various masks, demonstrating that the reconstructed $\kappa$ map by AKRA 2.0 maintains high accuracy. For the reconstructed $\kappa$ map in unmasked regions, the reconstructed convergence power spectrum $C_\kappa^{\rm{rec}}$ and the correlation coefficient with the true $\kappa$ map $r_\ell$ achieve accuracies of $(1-C_\ell^{\rm{rec}}/C_\ell^{\rm{true}}) \lesssim 1\%$ and $(1-r_\ell) \lesssim 1\%$, respectively. Our algorithm is capable of straightforwardly handling further issues such as inhomogeneous shape measurement noise, which we will address in subsequent analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmological upper bound on the total neutrino mass is the dominant limit on this fundamental parameter. Recent observations-soon to be improved-have strongly tightened it, approaching the lower limit set by oscillation data. Understanding its physical origin, robustness, and model-independence becomes pressing. Here, we explicitly separate for the first time the two distinct cosmological neutrino-mass effects: the impact on background evolution, related to the energy in neutrino masses; and the "kinematic" impact on perturbations, related to neutrino free-streaming. We scrutinize how they affect CMB anisotropies, introducing two effective masses enclosing $\textit{background}$ ($\sum m_\nu^\mathrm{Backg.}$) and $\textit{perturbations}$ ($\sum m_\nu^\mathrm{Pert.}$) effects. We analyze CMB data, finding that the neutrino-mass bound is mostly a background measurement, i.e., how the neutrino energy density evolves with time. The bound on the "kinematic" variable $\sum m_\nu^\mathrm{Pert.}$ is largely relaxed, $\sum m_\nu^\mathrm{Pert.} < 0.8\,\mathrm{eV}$. This work thus adds clarity to the physical origin of the cosmological neutrino-mass bound, which is mostly a measurement of the neutrino equation of state, providing also hints to evade such a bound.

 - **Abstract**
 Deuterium fractionation is a well-established evolutionary tracer in low-mass star formation, but its applicability to the high-mass regime remains an open question. The abundances and ratios of deuterated species have often been proposed as reliable evolutionary indicators for different stages of the high-mass star formation. We investigate the role of N$_2$H$^+$ and key deuterated molecules as tracers of the different stages of the high-mass star formation, and test whether their abundance ratios can serve as reliable evolutionary indicators. We conducted APEX observations of o-H$_2$D$^+$ (1$_{10}$-1$_{11}$), N$_2$H$^+$ (4-3), and N$_2$d$^+$ (3-2) in 40 high-mass clumps at different evolutionary stages, selected from the ATLASGAL survey. Molecular column densities ($N$) and abundances ($X$), were derived through spectral line modelling, both under local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE conditions. The $N$(o-H$_2$D$^+$) show the smallest deviation from LTE results when derived under non-LTE assumptions. In contrast, N$_2$D$^+$ shows the largest discrepancy between the $N$ derived from LTE and non-LTE. In all the cases discussed, we found that $X$(o-H$_2$D$^+$) decreases more significantly with time than in the case of $X$(N$_2$D$^+$); whereas $X$(N$_2$H$^+$) increases slightly. Therefore, the validity of the recently proposed $X$(o-H$_2$D$^+$)/$X$(N$_2$D$^+$) ratio as a reliable evolutionary indicator was not observed for this sample. While the deuteration fraction derived from N$_2$D$^+$ and N$_2$H$^+$ clearly decreases with clump evolution, the interpretation of this trend is complex, given the different distribution of the two tracers. Our results suggest that a careful consideration of the observational biases and beam-dilution effects are crucial for an accurate interpretation of the evolution of the deuteration process during the high-mass star formation process.

          Hot and cool: Characterising the companions of red supergiant stars in binary systems

 - **Abstract**
 In this article we study the nature of the recently identified populations of hot companions to red supergiant stars (RSGs). To this end, we compile the literature on the most well characterised systems with the aim of better understanding the hot companions identified with ultra-violet photometry and confirmed with Hubble Space Telescope spectra in the Local Group. We identify 9 systems with current masses greater than around 8 solar masses that have constraints on their orbital periods, which are in the range 3 to 75a. Antares (Alpha Sco) is the obvious outlier in this distribution, having an estimated orbital period of around 2000 a. Mass-ratio (q=M2/MRSG) estimates are available only for 5 of the compiled systems and range between 0.16 < q < 1. Ongoing efforts to identify and characterise hot companions to RSGs in the SMC have revealed 88 hot companions that have observational constraints free of contamination from the RSG component. We present a summary of a recently conducted HST UV spectroscopic survey that aims to characterise a subset of these companions. These companions show a flat-q distribution in the range 0.3 < q < 1.

 - **Abstract**
 The coldest Y spectral type brown dwarfs are similar in mass and temperature to cool and warm ($\sim$200 -- 400 K) giant exoplanets. We can therefore use their atmospheres as proxies for planetary atmospheres, testing our understanding of physics and chemistry for these complex, cool worlds. At these cold temperatures, their atmospheres are cold enough for water clouds to form, and chemical timescales increase, increasing the likelihood of disequilibrium chemistry compared to warmer classes of planets. JWST observations are revolutionizing the characterization of these worlds with high signal-to-noise, moderate resolution near- and mid-infrared spectra. The spectra have been used to measure the abundances of prominent species like water, methane, and ammonia; species that trace chemical reactions like carbon monoxide; and even isotopologues of carbon monoxide and ammonia. Here, we present atmospheric retrieval results using both published fixed-slit (GTO program 1230) and new averaged time series observations (GO program 2327) of the coldest known Y dwarf, WISE 0855-0714 (using NIRSpec G395M spectra), which has an effective temperature of $\sim$ 264 K. We present a detection of deuterium in an atmosphere outside of the solar system via a relative measurement of deuterated methane (CH$_{3}$D) and standard methane. From this, we infer the D/H ratio of a substellar object outside the solar system for the first time. We also present a well-constrained part-per-billion abundance of phosphine (PH$_{3}$). We discuss our interpretation of these results and the implications for brown dwarf and giant exoplanet formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Comparing how an asteroid appears in space to its ablation behavior during atmospheric passage and finally to the properties of associated meteorites represents the ultimate probe of small near-Earth objects. We present observations from the Lowell Discovery Telescope and from multiple meteor camera networks of 2022 WJ1, an Earth impactor which was disrupted over the North American Great Lakes on 19 November 2022. As far as we are aware, this is only the second time an Earth impactor has been specifically observed in multiple passbands prior to impact to characterize its composition. The orbits derived from telescopic observations submitted to the Minor Planet Center (MPC) and ground-based meteor cameras result in impact trajectories that agree to within 40 meters, but no meteorites have been found as of yet. The telescopic observations suggest a silicate-rich surface, and thus a moderate-to-high albedo, which results in an estimated size for the object of just D = 40 - 60 cm. Modeling the fragmentation of 2022 WJ1 during its fireball phase also suggests an approximate half-meter original size for the object as well as an ordinary chondrite-like strength. These two lines of evidence both support that 2022 WJ1 was likely an S-type condritic object and the smallest asteroid compositionally characterized in space. We discuss how best to combine telescopic and meteor camera datasets, how well these techniques agree, and what can be learned from studies of ultra-small asteroids.

 - **Abstract**
 Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) is an attractive dark matter candidate composed of ultralight particles. In this paper, toward a clear understanding of the core-halo relation in the FDM halos, we consider a simple model of the soliton-halo system, in which the self-gravitating soliton core is formed in the presence of Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halo potential as an external field. Solving numerically the Schrödinger-Poisson equation, the self-gravitating soliton is obtained as a ground-state solution, which is characterized by the two key parameters, i.e., size of soliton core and its strength of self-gravity relative to those of the NFW halo. Using our soliton-halo model, we investigate the properties of soliton cores found in cosmological simulation, and the key parameters characterizing these solitons are reconstructed in a self-consistent manner. Results suggest that (1) the soliton core properties depend critically on both the self-gravity of the soliton and the external potential of the host halo, and (2) the scatter observed in the core-halo relation cannot be explained solely by the one in the halo's concentration-mass relation, as previously suggested, but also significantly influenced by intrinsic features of the soliton core, potentially arising from local dynamics at the halo center. We also demonstrate that the FDM mass can be reconstructed from the simulation data characterizing the halo density profile, providing a basis for applying the model to observational studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The CompactObject package is an open-source software framework developed to constrain the neutron star equation of state (EOS) through Bayesian statistical inference. It integrates astrophysical observational constraints from X-ray timing, gravitational wave events, and radio measurements, as well as nuclear experimental constraints derived from perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) and Chiral Effective Field Theory ($\chi$EFT). The package supports a diverse range of EOS models, including meta-model like and several physics-motivated EOS models. It comprises three independent components: an EOS generator module that currently provides seven EOS choices, a Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation solver, that allows the determination of the Mass Radius and Tidal deformability as observables, and a comprehensive Bayesian inference workflow module, including a complete pipeline for implementing EOS Bayesian inference. Each component can be used independently in different scientific research contexts, such as nuclear physics and astrophysics. In addition, CompactObject is designed to work in synergy with existing software such as CompOSE, allowing the use of the CompOSE EOS database to extend the EOS options available.

          Unequivocal detection of the tidal deformation of a red giant in a binary system via interferometry

 - **Abstract**
 While mass transfer in binary systems is a crucial aspect of binary evolution models, it remains far from understood. HD 352 is a spectroscopic binary exhibiting ellipsoidal variability, likely due to a tidally deformed giant donor filling its Roche lobe and transferring matter to a faint companion. Here, we analyse VLTI/PIONIER interferometric observations of the system, obtained between 2010 to 2020. We demonstrate that observations near the system's quadrature cannot be explained by simple symmetric disk models, but are consistent with the shape of a Roche-lobe-filling star. We think that this is the first case of tidal deformation of a red giant being observed directly, thanks to the interferometric technique. By combining our interferometric modeling results with the analysis of the optical spectrum, multi-frequency spectral energy distribution, and published radial velocities and light curves, we constrain the system parameters and show that HD 352 will likely soon enter the common envelope phase, although we cannot reject the hypothesis that it is undergoing stable mass transfer against theoretical predictions. This has important consequences for modeling a large class of binary systems. Additionally, our observations confirm that Roche-lobe-filling giants can be resolved with interferometry under favorable conditions. Such observations may help resolve the mass transfer dichotomy in systems like symbiotic binaries, where the predominant mass transfer mode remains unclear.

          RAMSES-yOMP: Performance Optimizations for the Astrophysical Hydrodynamic Simulation Code RAMSES

 - **Abstract**
 Developing an efficient code for large, multiscale astrophysical simulations is crucial in preparing the upcoming era of exascale computing. RAMSES is an astrophysical simulation code that employs parallel processing based on the Message Passing Interface (MPI). However, it has limitations in computational and memory efficiency when using a large number of CPU cores. The problem stems from inefficiencies in workload distribution and memory allocation that inevitably occur when a volume is simply decomposed into domains equal to the number of working processors. We present RAMSES-yOMP, which is a modified version of RAMSES designed to improve parallel scalability. Major updates include the incorporation of Open Multi-Processing into the MPI parallelization to take advantage of both the shared and distributed memory models. Utilizing this hybrid parallelism in high-resolution benchmark simulations with full prescriptions for baryonic physics, we achieved a performance increase of a factor of 2 in the total run-time, while using 75% less memory and 30% less storage compared to the original code, when using the same number of processors. These improvements allow us to perform larger or higher-resolution simulations than what was feasible previously.

          Ionization chemistry in the inner disc: a combined treatment of ionic and thermionic emission and arbitrary grain size distributions

 - **Abstract**
 In the inner regions of protoplanetary discs, ionization chemistry controls the fluid viscosity, and is thus key to understanding various accretion, outflow and planet formation processes. The ionization is driven by thermal and non-thermal processes in the gas-phase, as well as by dust-gas interactions that lead to grain charging and ionic and thermionic emission from grain surfaces. The latter dust-gas interactions are moreover a strong function of the grain size distribution. However, analyses of chemical networks that include ionic/thermionic emission have so far only considered grains of a single size (or only approximately treated the effects of a size distribution), while analyses that include a distribution of grain sizes have ignored ionic/thermionic emission. Here, we: (1) investigate a general chemical network, widely applicable in inner disc regions, that includes gas-phase reactions, ionic and thermionic emission, and an arbitrary grain size distribution; (2) present a numerical method to solve this network in equilibrium; and (3) elucidate a general method to estimate the chemical time-scale. We show that: (a) approximating a grain size distribution by an "effective dust-to-gas ratio" (as done in previous work) can predict significantly inaccurate grain charges; and (b) grain charging significantly alters grain collisional time-scales in the inner disc. For conditions generally found in the inner disc, this work facilitates: (i) calculation of fluid resistivities and viscosity; and (ii) inclusion of the effect of grain charging on grain fragmentation and coagulation (a critical effect that is often ignored).

          Pebble Accretion

 - **Abstract**
 Pebble accretion refers to the growth of planetary bodies through the accretion of pebble-sized particles. Pebbles are defined in terms of their aerodynamically size $\tau_s$, which describes the level of coupling to the disk gas. Observations confirms the presence of pebble-sized particles in both protoplanetary disks and the early solar system. Pebble accretion proceeds through the settling mechanism, where particles settle to the surface of the planet. This Chapter discusses the key aspects of the pebble accretion framework: the accretion regimes, the planet initiation mass, and the planet isolation masses. The accretion behavior of loosely coupled $\tau_s > 1$ particles, referred to as "large pebbles", is also examined. The pebble accretion probability, $\epsilon$, is shown to be a useful parameter for evaluating the efficiency of the process, though this quantity is not necessarily high. Distinctions between pebble and planetesimal accretion are outlined. Pebble accretion, in particular, can be a highly effective mechanism in dense rings, as witnessed with ALMA.

 - **Abstract**
 The progenitors of Type II-P supernovae (SN) have been confirmed to be red supergiants. However, the upper mass limit of the directly probed progenitors is much lower than that predicted by current theories, and the accurate determination of the progenitor masses is key to understand the final fate of massive stars. Located at a distance of only 6.72 Mpc, the Type II-P SN 2024ggi is one of the closest SN in the last decade. Previous studies have analyzed its progenitor by direct detection, but the derived progenitor mass may be influenced by the very uncertain circumstellar extinction and pulsational brightness variability. In this work, we try to constrain the progenitor mass with an environmental analysis based on images from the Hubble Space Telescope. We found that stars in the progenitor environment have a uniform spatial distribution without significant clumpiness, and we derived the star formation history of the environment with a hierarchical Bayesian method. The progenitor is associated with the youngest population in the SN environment with an age of log($t$/yr) = 7.41 (i.e. 25.7 Myr), which corresponds to an initial mass of $10.2^{+0.06}_{-0.09}$ $M_\odot$. Our work provides an independent measurement of the progenitor mass, which is not affected by circumstellar extinction and pulsational brightness variability.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismology has emerged as a powerful tool to unravel the intricate relationships between evolved stars and their planetary systems. In this study, we leverage this technique to investigate the evolutionary stages of five exoplanet host stars, each exhibiting solar-like oscillations. Building on our previous work that identified two host stars as red clump and red giant branch (RGB) stars, this study focuses on a new and broader sample. By precisely measuring asteroseismic parameters such as the period spacing of dipole gravity modes ($\Delta\Pi_{1}$), we provide definitive confirmation of these stars' evolutionary states as subgiants or RGB stars. These results are not only crucial for understanding the internal structures of evolved stars but also for predicting the eventual fate of their planetary companions, which may face engulfment as their host stars expand. This research highlights the profound role of asteroseismology in advancing our knowledge of planetary system evolution and opens new pathways for exploring how stellar evolution impacts planetary survival. Our findings set the stage for future studies on the dynamic fates of exoplanets, providing key insights into the intricate processes of stellar and planetary evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We present starkiller, an open-source Python package for forward-modeling flux retrieval from integral field unit spectrograph (IFU) datacubes. Starkiller simultaneously provides stellar spectral classification, relative velocity, and line-of-sight extinction for all sources in a catalog, alongside a source-subtracted datacube. It performs synthetic difference imaging by simulating all catalog sources in the field of view, using the catalog for positions and fluxes to scale stellar models, independent of the datacube. This differencing method is particularly powerful for subtracting both point-sources and trailed or even streaked sources from extended astronomical objects. We demonstrate starkiller's effectiveness in improving observations of extended sources in dense stellar fields for VLT/MUSE observations of comets, asteroids and nebulae. We also show that starkiller can treat satellite-impacted VLT/MUSE observations. The package could be applied to tasks as varied as dust extinction in clusters and stellar variability; the stellar modeling using Gaia fluxes is provided as a standalone function. The techniques can be expanded to imagers and to other IFUs.

 - **Abstract**
 The solar system planets are benchmarks for the planet formation theory. Yet two paradigms coexist for the four terrestrial planets: the prolonged collisional growth among planetesimals lasting $>100$ million years (Myr) and the fast formation via planetesimals accreting pebbles within 10 Myr. Despite their dramatic difference, we can hardly tell which theory is more relevant to the true history of the terrestrial planets' formation. Here, we show that the Moon's origin puts stringent constraints on the pebble accretion scenario, rendering it less favourable. In the pebble accretion model, the one-off giant impact between proto-Earth and Theia rarely (probability $<$ 1\textperthousand) occurs at the right timing and configuration for the Moon formation. Even if a potential impact happens by chance, giant impact simulations reveal perfect mixing between proto-Earth and Theia, leaving no room for the observed primordial Earth mantle heterogeneity and the compositional difference, though small, between Earth and the Moon. Thus, the Earth-Moon system along other terrestrial planets should preferably form from chaotic collisional growth in the inner solar system.

 - **Abstract**
 We utilize a hybrid approach that integrates the traditional cross-correlation function (CCF) and machine learning to detect spectroscopic multi-systems, specifically focusing on double-line spectroscopic binary (SB2). Based on the ninth data release (DR9) of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), which includes a medium-resolution survey (MRS) containing 29,920,588 spectra, we identify 27,164 double-line and 3124 triple-line spectra, corresponding to 7096 SB2 candidates and 1903 triple-line spectroscopic binary (SB3) candidates, respectively, representing about 1% of the selection dataset from LAMOST-MRS DR9. Notably, 70.1% of the SB2 candidates and 89.6% of the SB3 candidates are newly identified. Compared to using only the traditional CCF technique, our method significantly improves the efficiency of detecting SB2, saves time on visual inspections by a factor of four.

 - **Abstract**
 Globally, Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments have revealed evidence supporting an existing gravitational wave background (GWB) signal in the PTA data set. Apart from acquiring more observations, the sensitivity of PTA experiments can be increased by improving the accuracy of the noise modeling. In PTA data analysis, noise modeling is conducted primarily using Bayesian statistics, relying on the marginal likelihood and Bayes factor to assess evidence. We introduce generalized steppingstone (GSS) as an efficient and accurate marginal likelihood estimation method for the PTA-Bayesian framework. This method enables cheaper estimates with high accuracy, especially when comparing expensive models such as the Hellings-Downs (HD) model or the overlap reduction function model (ORF). We demonstrate the efficiency and the accuracy of GSS for model selection and evidence calculation by reevaluating the evidence of previous analyses from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) 15 yr data set and the European PTA (EPTA) second data release. We find similar evidence for the GWB compared to the one reported by the NANOGrav 15-year data set. Compared to the evidence reported for the EPTA second data release, we find a substantial increase in evidence supporting GWB across all data sets.

 The nonlinear matter power spectrum in cosmology describes how matter density fluctuations vary with scale in the universe, providing critical insights into large-scale structure formation. The matter power spectrum includes both smooth regions and highly oscillatory features. Cosmologists rely on noisy, multi-resolution realizations of large N-body simulations to study these phenomena, which require appropriate smoothing techniques to learn about underlying structures. We introduce a Bayesian Deep Process Convolution (DPC) model that flexibly adapts its smoothness parameter across the input space, enabling it to capture both smooth and variable structure within a single framework. The DPC model leverages common patterns across related functions to improve estimation in regions with sparse data. Compared to existing methods, the DPC model offers superior accuracy and uncertainty quantification in simulated data, and qualitatively superior performance with the cosmological data. This methodology will be useful in cosmology and other fields requiring flexible modeling of smooth nonstationary surfaces.

 - **Abstract**
 A major challenge in extracting information from current and upcoming surveys of cosmological Large-Scale Structure (LSS) is the limited availability of computationally expensive high-fidelity simulations. We introduce Neural Quantile Estimation (NQE), a new Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) method that leverages a large number of approximate simulations for training and a small number of high-fidelity simulations for calibration. This approach guarantees an unbiased posterior and achieves near-optimal constraining power when the approximate simulations are reasonably accurate. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that cosmological parameters can be inferred at field level from projected 2-dim dark matter density maps up to $k_{\rm max}\sim1.5\,h$/Mpc at $z=0$ by training on $\sim10^4$ Particle-Mesh (PM) simulations with transfer function correction and calibrating with $\sim10^2$ Particle-Particle (PP) simulations. The calibrated posteriors closely match those obtained by directly training on $\sim10^4$ expensive PP simulations, but at a fraction of the computational cost. Our method offers a practical and scalable framework for SBI of cosmological LSS, enabling precise inference across vast volumes and down to small scales.

 - **Abstract**
 GRB$\,$220831A is a gamma-ray burst (GRB) with a duration and spectral peak energy that places it at the interface between the distribution of long-soft and short-hard GRBs. In this paper, we present the multi-wavelength follow-up campaign to GRB$\,$220831A and its optical, near-infrared, X-ray and radio counterparts. Our deep optical and near-infrared observations do not reveal an underlying host galaxy, and establish that GRB$\,$220831A is observationally hostless to depth, $m_i\gtrsim26.6$ AB mag. Based on the Amati relation and the non-detection of an accompanying supernova, we find that this GRB is most likely to have originated from a collapsar at $z>2$, but it could also possibly be a compact object merger at $z<0.4$ with a large separation distance from its host galaxy. Regardless of its origin, we show that its optical and near-infrared counterpart departs from the evolution expected from a forward shock dominated synchrotron afterglow, exhibiting a steep post-break temporal powerlaw index of $-3.83^{+0.62}_{-0.79}$, too steep to be the jet-break. By analysing a range of models, we find that the observed steep departure from forward shock closure relations is likely due to an internal process producing either a flare or a plateau.

 - **Abstract**
 Under the assumption that they are standard(isable) candles, the lightcurves of Type Ia supernovae have been analyzed in the framework of the standard Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker cosmology to conclude that the expansion rate of the Universe is accelerating due to dark energy. While the original claims in the late 1990s were made using overlapping samples of less than 100 supernovae in total, catalogues of nearly 2000 supernovae are now available. In light of recent developments such as the cosmic dipole anomaly and the larger than expected bulk flow in the local Universe (which does not converge to the Cosmic Rest Frame), we analyze the newer datasets using a Maximum Likelihood Estimator and find that the acceleration of the expansion rate of the Universe is unequivocally anisotropic. The associated debate in the literature highlights the artifices of using supernovae as standardisable candles, while also providing deeper insights into a consistent relativistic view of peculiar motions as departures from the Hubble expansion of the Universe. The effects of our being `tilted observers' embedded in a deep bulk flow may have been mistaken for cosmic acceleration.

 - **Abstract**
 Evidence has emerged for a stochastic signal correlated among 67 pulsars within the 15-year pulsar-timing data set compiled by the NANOGrav collaboration. Similar signals have been found in data from the European, Indian, Parkes, and Chinese PTAs. This signal has been interpreted as indicative of the presence of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background. To explore the internal consistency of this result we investigate how the recovered signal strength changes as we remove the pulsars one by one from the data set. We calculate the signal strength using the (noise-marginalized) optimal statistic, a frequentist metric designed to measure correlated excess power in the residuals of the arrival times of the radio pulses. We identify several features emerging from this analysis that were initially unexpected. The significance of these features, however, can only be assessed by comparing the real data to synthetic data sets. After conducting identical analyses on simulated data sets, we do not find anything inconsistent with the presence of a stochastic gravitational wave background in the NANOGrav 15-year data. The methodologies developed here can offer additional tools for application to future, more sensitive data sets. While this analysis provides an internal consistency check of the NANOGrav results, it does not eliminate the necessity for additional investigations that could identify potential systematics or uncover unmodeled physical phenomena in the data.

 - **Abstract**
 High energy cosmic-rays generate air showers when they enter Earth's atmosphere. Ground-based gamma-ray astronomy is possible using either direct detection of shower particles at mountain altitudes, or with arrays of imaging air-Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). Advances in the technique and larger collection areas have increased the rate at which air-shower events can be captured, and the amount of data produced by modern high-time-resolution Cherenkov cameras. Therefore, Data Volume Reduction (DVR) has become critical for such telescope arrays, ensuring that only useful information is stored long-term. Given the vast amount of raw data, owing to the highest resolution and sensitivity, the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will need robust data reduction strategies to ensure efficient handling and analysis. The CTAO data rates needs be reduced from hundreds of Petabytes (PB) per year to a few PB/year. This paper presents algorithms tailored for CTAO but also applicable for other arrays, focusing on selecting pixels likely to contain shower light. It describes and evaluates multiple algorithms based on their signal efficiency, noise rejection, and shower reconstruction. With a focus on a time-based clustering algorithm which demonstrates a notable enhancement in the retention of low-level signal pixels. Moreover, the robustness is assessed under different observing conditions, including detector defects. Through testing and analysis, it is shown that these algorithms offer promising solutions for efficient volume reduction in CTAO, addressing the challenges posed by the array's very large data volume and ensuring reliable data storage amidst varying observational conditions and hardware issues.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive a family of similarity solutions to the nonlinear non-equilibrium Marshak wave problem for an inhomogeneous planar medium which is coupled to a time dependent radiation driving source. We employ the non-equilibrium gray diffusion approximation in the supersonic regime. The solutions constitute a generalization of the non-equilibrium nonlinear solutions that were developed recently for homogeneous media. Self-similar solutions are constructed for a power law time dependent surface temperature, a spatial power law density profile and a material model with power law temperature and density dependent opacities and specific energy density. The extension of the problem to non-homogeneous media enables the existence of similarity solutions for a general power law specific material energy. It is shown that the solutions exist for specific values of the temporal temperature drive and spatial density exponents, which depend on the material exponents. We also illustrate how the similarity solutions take various qualitatively different forms which are analyzed with respect to various parameters. Based on the solutions, we define a set of non-trivial benchmarks for supersonic non-equilibrium radiative heat transfer. The similarity solutions are compared to gray diffusion simulations as well as to detailed implicit Monte-Carlo and discrete-ordinate transport simulations in the optically-thick regime, showing a great agreement, which highlights the benefit of these solutions as a code verification test problem.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents the results of a joint radio and gamma-ray timing campaign on the nine millisecond pulsars (MSPs) discovered as part of the L-band targeted survey of Fermi-LAT sources performed in the context of the Transients and Pulsars with MeerKAT (TRAPUM) Large Survey Project. Out of these pulsars, eight are members of binary systems; of these eight, two exhibit extended eclipses of the radio emission. Using an initial radio timing solution, pulsations were found in the gamma rays for six of the targets. For these sources, a joint timing analysis of radio times of arrival and gamma-ray photons was performed, using a newly developed code that optimises the parameters through a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. This approach has allowed us to precisely measure both the short- and long-term timing parameters. This study includes a proper motion measurement for four pulsars, which a gamma ray-only analysis would not have been sensitive to, despite the 15-year span of Fermi data.

          Radii, masses, and transit-timing variations of the three-planet system orbiting the naked-eye star TOI-396

 - **Abstract**
 TOI-396 is an F6V star ($V\approx6.4$) orbited by three transiting planets. The orbital periods of the two innermost planets are close to the 5:3 commensurability ($P_b \sim3.6$ d and $P_c \sim6.0$ d). To measure the masses of the three planets, refine their radii, and investigate whether planets b and c are in MMR, we carried out HARPS RV observations and retrieved photometric data from TESS. We extracted the RVs via a skew-normal fit onto the HARPS CCFs and performed an MCMC joint analysis of the Doppler measurements and transit photometry, while employing the breakpoint method to remove stellar activity from the RV time series. We also performed a thorough TTV dynamical analysis of the system. Our analysis confirms that the three planets have similar sizes: $R_b=2.004_{-0.047}^{+0.045}R_{\oplus}$; $R_c=1.979_{-0.051}^{+0.054}R_{\oplus}$; $R_d=2.001_{-0.064}^{+0.063}R_{\oplus}$. For the first time, we determine RV masses for TOI-396b and d: $M_b=3.55_{-0.96}^{+0.94}M_{\oplus}$ ($\rho_b=2.44_{-0.68}^{+0.69}$ g cm$^{-3}$) and $M_d=7.1\pm1.6M_{\oplus}$ ($\rho_d=4.9_{-1.1}^{+1.2}$ g cm$^{-3}$). Our results suggest a quite unusual system architecture, with the outermost planet being the densest. The Doppler reflex motion induced by TOI-396c remains undetected in our RV time series, likely due to the proximity of $P_c$ to the star's rotation period ($P_{\mathrm{rot}}=6.7\pm1.3$ d). We also discovered that TOI-396b and c display significant TTVs. While the TTV dynamical analysis returns a formally precise mass for TOI-396c ($M_{c,\mathrm{dyn}}=2.24^{+0.13}_{-0.67}M_{\oplus}$), the result might not be accurate owing to the poor sampling of the TTV phase. We also conclude that TOI-396b and c are close to-, but out of- the 5:3 MMR. Our numerical simulation suggests TTV semi-amplitudes of up to 5 hours over a temporal baseline of $\sim$5.2 years.

 - **Abstract**
 Two enigmatic gamma-ray features in the Galactic central region, known as Fermi Bubbles (FBs), were found from Fermi-LAT data. An energy release (e.g., by tidal disruption events in the Galactic center, GC), generates a cavity with a shock that expands into the local ambient medium of the Galactic halo. A decade or so ago, a phenomenological model of the FBs was suggested as a result of routine star disruptions by the supermassive black hole in the GC which might provide enough energy for large-scale structures, like the FBs. In 2020, analytical and numerical models of the FBs as a process of routine tidal disruption of stars near the GC were developed, which can provide enough cumulative energy to form and maintain large scale structures like the FBs. The disruption events are expected to be ten to hundred events per million years, providing the average power of energy release from the GC into the halo of 3E41 erg/s, which is needed to support the FBs. Analysis of the evolution of superbubbles in exponentially stratified disks concluded that the FB envelope would be destroyed by the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities at late stages. The shell is composed of a swept-up gas of the bubble, whose thickness is much thinner in comparison to the size of the envelope. We assume that hydrodynamic turbulence is excited in the FB envelope by the RT instability. In this case, the universal energy spectrum of turbulence may be developed in the inertial range of wavenumbers of fluctuations (the Kolmogorov-Obukhov spectrum). From our model we suppose the power of the FBs is transformed partly into the energy of hydrodynamic turbulence in the envelope. If so, hydrodynamic turbulence may generate MHD-fluctuations, which accelerate cosmic rays there and generate gamma-ray and radio emission from the FBs. We hope that this model may interpret the observed nonthermal emission from the bubbles.

 - **Abstract**
 The observations of compact star inspirals from LIGO/Virgo combined with mass and radius measurements from NICER provide a valuable tool to study the highly uncertain equation of state (EOS) of dense matter at the densities characteristic of compact stars. In this work, we constrain the solid states of strange-cluster matter, called strangeon matter, as the putative basic units of the ground state of bulk strong matter using a Bayesian statistical method, incorporating the mass and radius measurements of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, and the recent data for the $1.4\ M_{\odot}$ pulsar PSR J0437-4751. We also include constraints from gravitational wave events GW170817 and GW190814. Under the prior assumption of a finite number of quarks in a strangeon, $N_{\rm q}$, our analysis reveals that current mass-radius measurements favor a larger $N_{\rm q}$. Specifically, the results support the scenario where a strangeon forms a stable bound state with $N_{\rm q}=18$, symmetric in color, flavor, and spin spaces, compared to the minimum $N_{\rm q}$ prior. The comparative analyses of the posterior EOS parameter spaces derived from three-parameter model and two-parameter model demonstrate a consistent prediction under identical observational constraints. In particular, our results indicate that the most probable values of the maximum mass are found to be $3.58^{+0.16}_{-0.12}\ M_{\odot}$ ($3.65^{+0.18}_{-0.16}\ M_{\odot}$) at $90\%$ confidence level for three-parameter (two-parameter) EOS considering the constraints of GW190814. The corresponding radii for $1.4\ M_{\odot}$ and $2.1\ M_{\odot}$ stars are $12.04^{+0.27}_{-0.31}~\rm km$ ($12.16^{+0.26}_{-0.31}~\rm km$) and $13.43^{+0.31}_{-0.32}~\rm km$ ($13.60^{+0.29}_{-0.34}~\rm km$), respectively. This result may impact interestingly on the research of multiquark states, which could improve our understanding of the nonperturbative strong force.

 Aims: We computed a celestial reference frame (CRF) from Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Global Observing System (VGOS) data after five years of regular observations (155 multi-baseline 24-hour VGOS sessions until 2024.0). In this paper we document the source selection and scheduling strategies for the individual sessions, and investigate the effect of using this new VGOS CRF in the analysis of individual geodetic VLBI sessions. We carried out several comparisons with ICRF3-SX, and with VIE2023sx CRF which includes VLBI S/X data until 2024.0. Furthermore, we studied the effect of more frequent estimations of tropospheric parameters on the estimated CRF in the current VGOS network. We evaluated the VIE2023-VG CRF in the geodetic analysis of VGOS sessions where the source positions were fixed to either the VIE2023-VG CRF or to ICRF3-SX. Results: The current VIE2023-VG CRF is built with 1.39 million VGOS group delays and includes 418 radio sources, where 172 sources (41%) are introduced in only four research and development sessions alone. We show that the VIE2023-VG CRF has excellent source position precision. The median formal error from the least-squares adjustment is 30 microas for right ascension (scaled by cosine of declination) and 47 microas for declination. In terms of systematic distortions versus ICRF3-SX, the largest terms in the vector spherical harmonics up to the degree and order two, reach in absolute values around 60 microas, caused by correlations between the individual terms. Because of the lack of observations in the southern hemisphere, a constraint for a zero slope in declination difference with respect to ICRF3-SX is imposed in the global adjustment. Therefore, VGOS should prioritize the development of southern stations in order to limit the need for such constraints on the frame.

 - **Abstract**
 The persistent BeXRBs are a class of High-Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXRBs), which are characterized by persistent low X-ray luminosities ($L_{\rm X} \sim 10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$) and wide ($P_{\rm orb} >$ 30 d), almost circular orbits. In these sources the NS is slowly rotating (with $P_{\rm spin}$ well above 100 s) and accretes matter directly from the wind of the companion Be star, without the formation of an accretion disk. Since the '90s, when the first four members of this class were identified, several other sources of the same type have been discovered and investigated. Thanks to follow-up XMM-Newton observations, we have verified that most of them share common spectral and timing properties, such as a pulsed fraction that does not vary with the photon energy and a hot (kT = 1-2 keV) blackbody spectral component which contributes for 20-40 % to the total flux and has a size consistent with the NS polar cap. Here we provide an overview of how XMM-Newton contributed to constrain the observational properties and the current understanding of this type of sources. We also report about the first results obtained with a very recent XMM-Newton observation of the poorly known BeXRB 4U 0728-25.

 - **Abstract**
 The Magellanic Stream has long been known to contain multiple HI strands and corresponding stellar populations are beginning to be discovered. Combining an H3-selected sample with stars drawn from the Gaia catalog, we trace stars along a sub-dominant strand of the Magellanic Stream, as defined by gas content, across 30$^\circ$ on the sky. We find that the dominant strand is devoid of stars with Galactocentric distance $\lesssim 55$ kpc while the subdominant strand shows a close correspondence to such stars. We conclude that (1) the two Stream strands have different origins, (2) they are likely only close in projection, (3) the subdominant strand is tidal in origin, and (4) the subdominant strand is composed of disk material, likely drawn from the disk of the Small Magellanic Cloud.

 The intense debate about the presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere has stimulated the study of methanogens adapted to terrestrial habitats that mimic Martian environments. We examinate the environmental conditions, energy sources and ecology of terrestrial methanogens thriving in deep crystalline fractures, sub-sea hypersaline lakes and subglacial water bodies considered as analogs of a hypothetical habitable Martian subsurface. We combine this information with recent data on the distribution of buried water or ice and radiogenic elements on Mars and with models of the subsurface thermal regime of this planet to identify a 4.3-8.8 km-deep regolith habitat at the mid-latitude location of Acidalia Planitia, that might fit the requirements for hosting putative Martian methanogens analogous to the methanogenic families Methanosarcinaceae and Methanomicrobiaceae.

 - **Abstract**
 The microhertz frequency band of gravitational waves probes the merger of supermassive black holes as well as many other gravitational wave phenomena. However, space-interferometry methods that use test masses would require substantial development of test-mass isolation systems to detect anticipated astrophysical events. We propose an approach that avoids inertial test masses by situating spacecraft in the low-acceleration environment of the outer Solar System. We show that for Earth-spacecraft and inter-spacecraft distances of $\gtrsim 10$ AU, the accelerations on the spacecraft would be sufficiently small to potentially achieve sensitivities determined by stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds. We further argue, for arm lengths of $10-30$ AU and $10$ Watt transmissions, that stable phase locks should be achievable with 20 cm mirrors or 5 m radio dishes. We discuss designs that send both laser beams and radio waves between the spacecraft, finding that despite the $\sim10^4\times$ longer wavelengths, even a design with radio transmissions could reach stochastic background-limited sensitivities at $\lesssim 0.3\times 10^{-4}$ Hz. Operating in the radio significantly reduces many spacecraft design tolerances. Our baseline concept requires two arms to do interferometry. However, if one spacecraft carries a clock with Allan deviations at $10^4$ seconds of $10^{-17}$, a comparable sensitivity could be achieved with a single arm. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of achieving similar gravitational wave sensitivities in a `Doppler tracking' configuration where the single arm is anchored to Earth.

By quantifying the detectability as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and molecular abundance, we can constrain the best methods of detection with the high-contrast space-based coronagraphy slated for the next generation telescopes such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). We used 25 bandpasses between 0.8 and 1.5 microns. The abundances range from a modern-Earth level to an Archean-Earth level, driven by abundances found in available literature. We constrain the optimal 20%, 30%, and 40% bandpasses based on the effective SNR of the data, and investigate the impact of spectral confusion between CH4 and H2O on the detectability of each one. We find that a modern-Earth level of CH4 is not detectable, while an Archean Earth level of CH4 would be detectable at all SNRs and bandpass widths. Crucially, we find that CH4 detectability is inversely correlated with H2o abundance, with required SNR increasing as H2O abundance increases, while H2O detectability depends on CH4 abundance and selected observational wavelength, implying that science requirements for the characterization of Earth-like planet atmospheres in the VIS/NIR should consider the abundances of both species in tandem.

 The ground-based measurement of gravitational waves (GW) from merging binary black holes (BBH) uniquely allows determination of spins of stellar-remnant black holes (BH), thereby offering insights into their formation mechanisms. The observed population of BBH mergers exhibits two intriguing peculiarities related to BH spins, namely, a positively biased distribution of effective spin parameter, $\chi_{\rm eff}$, and an apparent anti-correlation between merger mass ratio, $q$, and $\chi_{\rm eff}$. Here we investigate the potential mechanisms for such observed properties, in BBH mergers via isolated binary evolution. We synthesize BBH mergers with the fast binary evolution code BSE. The role of various physical assumptions is explored, including tidal spin-up, compact remnant mass, and mass transfer physics. We compare the properties of WR-BH binaries that formed through stable mass transfer (SMT) and common envelope evolution (CE). We find that both the asymmetry in $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution and the $\chi_{\rm eff}-q$ anti-correlation are natural outcomes of isolated-binary BBH formation with the standard assumptions on mass transfer physics. The anti-correlation is particularly pronounced for SMT-channel BBH mergers that experience a mass-ratio-reversal, i.e., those where the second-born BH is the more massive member. The anti-correlation arises from the dependence of orbital shrinking during mass transfer and the Roche lobe size on the system's mass ratio. This characteristic $\chi_{\rm eff}-q$ trend diminishes with increasing metallicity and when the isolated-binary BBH merger population is mixed with a significant contribution of dynamically formed BBH mergers. Our results demonstrate that isolated massive binary evolution via the SMT sub-channel can reproduce the observable BBH merger population, with characteristic signatures in mass, mass ratio, and spin distributions.[abr.]

 The $\sim$5 Myr PDS 70 is the only known system with protoplanets residing in the cavity of the circumstellar disk from which they formed, ideal for studying exoplanet formation and evolution within its natal environment. Here we report the first spin constraint and C/O measurement of PDS 70b from Keck/KPIC high-resolution spectroscopy. We detected CO (3.8 $\sigma$) and H$_2$O (3.5 $\sigma$) molecules in the PDS 70b atmosphere via cross-correlation, with a combined CO and H$_2$O template detection significance of 4.2 $\sigma$. Our forward model fits, using BT-Settl model grids, provide an upper limit for the spin-rate of PDS 70b ($<$29 km s$^{-1}$). The atmospheric retrievals constrain the PDS 70b C/O ratio to ${0.28}^{+0.20}_{-0.12}$ ($<$0.63 under 95$\%$ confidence level) and a metallicity [C/H] of ${-0.2}^{+0.8}_{-0.5}$ dex, consistent with that of its host star. The following scenarios can explain our measured C/O of PDS 70b in contrast with that of the gas-rich outer disk (for which C/O $\gtrsim$ 1). First, the bulk composition of PDS 70b might be dominated by dust+ice aggregates rather than disk gas. Another possible explanation is that the disk became carbon-enriched $\textit{after}$ PDS 70b was formed, as predicted in models of disk chemical evolution and as observed in both very low mass star and older disk systems with $\textit{JWST}$/MIRI. Because PDS 70b continues to accrete and its chemical evolution is not yet complete, more sophisticated modeling of the planet and the disk, and higher quality observations of PDS 70b (and possibly PDS 70c), are necessary to validate these scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 With an aim towards modeling cosmologies beyond the LCDM paradigm, we demonstrate the automatic construction of recombination history emulators while enforcing a prior of causal dynamics. These methods are particularly useful in the current era of precision cosmology, where extremely constraining datasets provide insights into a cosmological model dominated by unknown contents. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data in particular provide a clean glimpse into the interaction of dark matter, baryons, and radiation in the early Universe, but interpretation of this data requires knowledge of the evolution of the ionization history of the Universe. The exploration of new physics with new CMB data will require fast and flexible calculation of this ionization history. We develop a differentiable machine learning model for recombination physics using a neural network ordinary differential equation model (Universal Differential Equations, UDEs), building towards automatic dimensionality reduction and the avoidance of manual tuning based on cosmological model.
