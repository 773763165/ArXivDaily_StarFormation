 - **Abstract**
 We construct explicit models of classical primordial standard clocks in an alternative to inflation, namely the slowly contracting ekpyrotic scenario. We study the phenomenology of massive spectator fields added to a state-of-the-art ekpyrotic model, with coupling functions that allow for these heavy fields to be classically excited while the background is slowly contracting. We perform numerical computations of the corrections to the scalar primordial power spectrum and compare with analytical estimates. Our full numerical results reveal so-called clock signals, sharp feature signals, as well as signals that link the two together. The models are found to predict oscillatory features that are resolutely different from what is calculated in inflation, and thus, such features represent unique fingerprints of a slowly contracting universe. This confirms the capability of primordial standard clocks to model-independently discriminate among very early universe scenarios.

          Giant Outer Transiting Exoplanet Mass (GOT `EM) Survey. V. Two Giant Planets in Kepler-511 but Only One Ran Away

 - **Abstract**
 Systems hosting multiple giant planets are important laboratories for understanding planetary formation and migration processes. We present a nearly decade-long Doppler spectroscopy campaign from the Keck-I telescope to characterize the two transiting giant planets orbiting Kepler-511 on orbits of 27 days and 297 days. The radial velocity measurements yield precise masses for both planets, which we use to infer their bulk heavy element content. Both planets contain approximately 30 Earth masses of heavy elements, but their bulk metallicities (i.e., the ratio between metal mass and total mass) are drastically different ($0.86 \pm 0.04$ and $0.22 \pm 0.04$ respectively). Envelope mass loss cannot account for this difference due to the relatively large orbital distance and mass of the inner planet. We conclude that the outer planet underwent runaway gas accretion while the inner planet did not. This bifurcation in accretion histories is likely a result of the accretion of gas with very different metallicities by the two planets or the late formation of the inner planet from a merger of sub-Neptunes. Kepler-511 uniquely demonstrates how giant planet formation can produce strikingly different outcomes even for planets in the same system.

 - **Abstract**
 Interactions between exoplanetary atmospheres and internal properties have long been hypothesized to be drivers of the inflation mechanisms of gaseous planets and apparent atmospheric chemical disequilibrium conditions. However, transmission spectra of exoplanets has been limited in its ability to observational confirm these theories due to the limited wavelength coverage of HST and inferences of single molecules, mostly H$_2$O. In this work, we present the panchromatic transmission spectrum of the approximately 750 K, low-density, Neptune-sized exoplanet WASP-107b using a combination of HST WFC3, JWST NIRCam and MIRI. From this spectrum, we detect spectroscopic features due to H$_2$O (21$\sigma$), CH$_4$ (5$\sigma$), CO (7$\sigma$), CO$_2$ (29$\sigma$), SO$_2$ (9$\sigma$), and NH$_3$ (6$\sigma$). The presence of these molecules enable constraints on the atmospheric metal enrichment (M/H is 10--18$\times$ Solar), vertical mixing strength (log$_{10}$K$_{zz}$=8.4--9.0 cm$^2$s$^{-1}$), and internal temperature ($>$345 K). The high internal temperature is suggestive of tidally-driven inflation acting upon a Neptune-like internal structure, which can naturally explain the planet's large radius and low density. These findings suggest that eccentricity driven tidal heating is a critical process governing atmospheric chemistry and interior structure inferences for a majority of the cool ($<$1,000K) super-Earth-to-Saturn mass exoplanet population.

 - **Abstract**
 This study delves into [W60] B90, one of the most luminous and extreme Red Supergiants (RSGs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), aiming to search for evidence of episodic mass loss. Our discovery of a bar-like nebular structure at 1 pc, reminiscent of the bar around Betelgeuse, raised the question of whether [W60] B90 also has a bow shock. We collected and analyzed proper motion data from Gaia, as well as new multi-epoch spectroscopic and imaging data, and archival time-series photometry in the optical and mid-infrared. We found [W60] B90 to be a walkaway star, with a supersonic peculiar velocity in the direction of the bar. We detected shocked emission between the bar and the star, based on the [S II]/H$\alpha$ > 0.4 criterion, providing strong evidence for a bow shock. The 30-year optical light curve revealed semi-regular variability, showing three similar dimming events with $\Delta V \sim 1$ mag, a recurrence of $\sim$12 yr, and a rise time of 400 d. We found the mid-IR light curve to vary by 0.51 mag and 0.37 mag in the WISE1 and WISE2 bands, respectively, and by 0.42 mag and 0.25 mag during the last dimming event. During this event, optical spectroscopy revealed spectral variability (M3I to M4I), a correlation between the $T_{\rm eff}$ and the brightness, increased extinction, and, after the minimum, spectral features incompatible with the models. We also found a difference of >300 K between the $T_{\rm eff}$ measured from the TiO bands in the optical and the atomic lines from our $J$-band spectroscopy. We inferred that [W60] B90 is a more massive analog of Betelgeuse in the LMC and the first extragalactic single RSG with a suspected bow shock. Its high luminosity $\log(L/L_{\odot})=5.32$ dex, mass-loss rate, and mid-IR variability compared to other RSGs in the LMC, indicate that it is in an unstable evolutionary state undergoing episodes of mass loss.

          (Re)mind the gap: a hiatus in star formation history unveiled by APOGEE DR17

 - **Abstract**
 The analysis of several spectroscopic surveys indicates the presence of a bimodality between the disc stars in the abundance ratio space of [${\alpha}$/Fe] versus [Fe/H]. The two stellar groups are commonly referred to as the high-${\alpha}$ and low-${\alpha}$ sequences. Some models capable of reproducing such a bimodality, invoke the presence of a hiatus in the star formation history in our Galaxy, whereas other models explain the two sequences by means of stellar migration. Our aim is to show that the existence of the gap in the star formation rate between high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ is evident in the stars of APOGEE DR17, if one plots [Fe/$\alpha$] versus [$\alpha$/H], thus confirming previous suggestions by Gratton et al. (1996) and Fuhrmann (1998). Then we try to interpret the data by means of detailed chemical models. We compare the APOGEE DR17 red giant stars with the predictions of a detailed chemical evolution model based on the two-infall paradigm, taking also into account possible accretion of dwarf satellites. The APOGEE DR17 abundance ratios [Fe/$\alpha$] versus [$\alpha$/H] exhibit a sharp increase of [Fe/$\alpha$] at a nearly constant [$\alpha$/H] (where $\alpha$ elements considered are Mg, Si, O) during the transition between the two disc phases. This observation strongly supports the hypothesis that a hiatus in star formation occurred during this evolutionary phase. Notably, the most pronounced growth in the [Fe/$\alpha$] versus [$\alpha$/H] relation is observed for oxygen, as this element is exclusively synthesised in core-collapse supernovae. A chemical model predicting a stop in the star formation of a duration of roughly 3.5 Gyr, and where the high-$\alpha$ disc starts forming from pre-enriched gas by a previous encounter with a dwarf galaxy can well explain the observations.

          An Outflow-Driven Water Maser Associated with Positive Black Hole Feedback in the Dwarf Galaxy Henize 2-10

 - **Abstract**
 Henize 2-10 is a dwarf galaxy experiencing positive black hole (BH) feedback from a radio-detected low-luminosity active galactic nucleus. Previous Green Bank Telescope (GBT) observations detected a H2O "kilomaser" in Henize 2-10, but the low angular resolution (33") left the location and origin of the maser ambiguous. We present new Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations of the H2O maser line at 22.23508 GHz in Henize 2-10 with ~2" resolution. These observations reveal two maser sources distinct in position and velocity. The first maser source is spatially coincident with the known BH outflow and the region of triggered star formation ~70 pc to the east. Combined with the broad width of the maser (W50 ~ 66 km s-1), this confirms our hypothesis that part of the maser detected with the GBT is produced by the impact of the BH outflow shocking the dense molecular gas along the flow and at the interface of the eastern star-forming region. The second maser source lies to the south-east far from the central BH and has a narrow width (W50 ~ 8 km s-1), suggesting a star-formation-related origin. This work has revealed the nature of the H2O kilomaser in Henize 2-10 and illustrates the first known connection between outflow-driven H2O masers and positive BH feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic center lobe (GCL) is an object ~1° across that is located north of the Galactic center. In the mid-infrared (MIR) the GCL appears as two 8.0${\mu}$m filaments between which is strong 24${\mu}$m and radio continuum emission. Due to its morphology and location in the sky, previous authors have argued that the GCL is located in the Galactic center region, created by outflows from star formation or by activity of the central black hole Sagittarius A*. In an associated paper (Hurley-Walker et al., 2024, in press), low-frequency radio emission indicates that the GCL must instead lie foreground to the Galactic center. If the GCL is foreground to the Galactic center, it is likely to be a type of object common throughout the Galactic disk; we here investigate whether its properties are similar to those of Galactic HII regions. We find that the GCL's MIR morphology, MIR flux densities, dust temperatures, and radio recombination line (RRL) properties as traced by the GBT Diffuse Ionized Gas Survey (GDIGS) are consistent with those of known Galactic HII regions, although the derived electron temperature is low. We search for the ionizing source(s) of the possible HII region and identify a stellar cluster candidate (Camargo #1092/Ryu & Lee #532) and a cluster of young stellar objects (SPICY G359.3+0.3) whose members have Gaia parallaxes distances of 1.7${\pm}$0.4kpc. Taken together, the results of our companion paper and those shown here suggest that the GCL has properties consistent with those of an HII region located ~2kpc from the Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 Our understanding of how exoplanets form and evolve relies on analyses of both the mineralogy of protoplanetary disks and their detailed structures; however, these key complementary aspects of disks are usually studied separately. We present initial results from a hybrid model that combines the empirical characterization of the mineralogy of a disk, as determined from its mid-infrared spectral features, with the MCFOST radiative transfer disk model, a combination we call the EaRTH Disk Model. With the results of the mineralogy detection serving as input to the radiative transfer model, we generate mid-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that reflect both the mineralogical and structural parameters of the corresponding disk. Initial fits of the SED output by the resulting integrated model to Spitzer Space T elescope mid-infrared (IRS) spectra of the protoplanetary disk orbiting the nearby T Tauri star MP Mus demonstrate the potential advantages of this approach by revealing details like the dominance of micron-sized olivine and micron-sized forsterite in this dusty disk. The simultaneous insight into disk composition and structure provided by the EaRTH Disk methodology should be directly applicable to the interpretation of mid-infrared spectra of protoplanetary disks that will be produced by the James Webb Space Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 The {\em bulk flow} in the Local Universe is a collective phenomenon due to the peculiar motions of matter structures, which, instead of moving in random directions, appears to follow an approximate dipole velocity flow. We apply a directional analysis to investigate, through the Hubble-Lema\^ıtre diagram, the angular dependence of the Hubble constant $H_0$ of a sample of Type Ia Supernovae from the Pantheon+ catalog in the Local Universe ($0.015 \le z \le 0.06$). We perform a directional analysis that reveals a statistically significant dipole variation of $H_0$, at more than $99.9\%$ confidence level, showing that matter structures follow a dipole bulk flow motion towards $(l,b) = (326.^\circ1 \pm 11.^\circ2,27.^\circ8 \pm 11.^\circ2)$, close to the Shapley supercluster $(l_{\scalebox{0.6}{Shapley}},b_{\scalebox{0.6}{Shapley}}) = (311.^\circ5, 32.^\circ3)$, with velocity $132.14 \pm 109.3$ km s$^{-1}$ at the effective distance $102.83 \pm 10.2$~Mpc. Interestingly, the antipodal direction of this dipole points close to the Dipole Repeller structure. Our analyses confirm that the gravitational dipole system Shapley-Dipole Repeller explains well the observed bulk flow velocity field in the Local Universe. Furthermore, we performed robustness tests that support our results. Additionally, our approach provides a measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0 = 70.39 \pm 1.4$~\text{km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$}, at the effective distance $102.8$~Mpc, $z \simeq 0.025$.

          Spectroscopic Survey of Faint Planetary-Nebula Nuclei. V. The EGB 6-Type Central Star of Abell 57

 - **Abstract**
 During our spectroscopic survey of central stars of faint planetary nebulae (PNe), we found that the nucleus of Abell 57 exhibits strong nebular emission lines. Using synthetic narrow-band images, we show that the emission arises from an unresolved compact emission knot (CEK) coinciding with the hot (90,000 K) central star. Thus Abell 57 belongs to the rare class of "EGB 6-type" PNe, characterized by dense emission cores. Photometric data show that the nucleus exhibits a near-IR excess, due to a dusty companion body with the luminosity of an M0 dwarf but a temperature of ~1800 K. Emission-line analysis reveals that the CEK is remarkably dense (electron density ~1.6x10**7 cm**-3), and has a radius of only ~4.5 AU. The CEK suffers considerably more reddening than the central star, which itself is more reddened than the surrounding PN. These puzzles may suggest an interaction between the knot and central star; however, Hubble Space Telescope imaging of EGB 6 itself shows that its CEK lies more than ~125 AU from the PN nucleus. We discuss a scenario in which a portion of the AGB wind that created the PN was captured into a dust cloud around a distant stellar companion; this cloud has survived to the present epoch, and has an atmosphere photoionized by radiation from the hot central star. However, in this picture EGB 6-type nuclei should be relatively common, yet they are actually extremely rare; thus they may arise from a different transitory phenomenon. We suggest future observations of Abell 57 that may help unravel its mysteries.

 - **Abstract**
 The High Energy Stereoscopic System H.E.S.S. is an array of Cherenkov Telescopes located in the Khomas Highlands in Namibia. H.E.S.S. started operations in 2003 and has been operated very successfully since then. With its location in the Southern hemisphere, the system provides a privileged view of the Milky Way and the Galactic center region. With H.E.S.S., a large variety of new TeV emitters has been discovered, both in our Galaxy and in extragalactic space. We provide a description of the individual telescopes and of the system as a whole, and review the scientific highlights that have been achieved with the instrument.

          The IACOB project: CVIII. Hunting for spectroscopic binaries in the O and B supergiant domain.The threat of pulsational variability

 - **Abstract**
 Observations have definitively strengthened the long-standing assertion that binaries are crucial in massive star evolution. While the percentage of spectroscopic binary systems among main-sequence O stars is well-studied, other phases of massive star evolution remain less explored. We aim to estimate the spectroscopic binary fraction in Galactic late O- and B-type supergiants (OB-Sgs) and set empirical thresholds in radial velocity (RV) to avoid misidentifying pulsating stars as single-line spectroscopic binaries. Using over 4500 high-resolution spectra of 56 Galactic OB-Sgs (plus 13 O dwarfs/subgiants and 5 early-B giants) from the IACOB project (2008-2020), we apply Gaussian fitting and centroid computation techniques to measure RV for each spectrum. Our findings reveal that intrinsic variability in OB-Sgs can result in peak-to-peak RV amplitudes (RVpp) of up to 20-25 km/s, notably in late-O and early-B Sgs, and decreases to typical values of RVpp in the range of 1-5 km/s for O dwarfs and 2-15 km/s for late B-Sgs. Considering these results and evaluating line-profile variability in each star, we find that 10$\pm$4% of OB-Sgs are clearly single-line spectroscopic binaries. In addition, we find that the percentage of double-line spectroscopic binaries in late O- and early B-Sgs is ~6%, much lower than the ~30% in O-type dwarfs and giants. This study, along with prior research on B-Sgs in the 30 Doradus region of the LMC, indicates that the spectroscopic binary percentage decreases by a factor of 4-5 from O stars to B-Sgs. Our study underscores the need for a thorough characterization of spectroscopic variability due to intrinsic sources to reliably determine the spectroscopic binary fraction among OB-Sgs and O-type stars in general, offering valuable insights into the impact of binaries on massive star evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The oldest stars in the Milky Way are metal-poor with [Fe/H] < -- 1.0, displaying peculiar elemental abundances compared to solar values. The relative variations in the chemical compositions among stars is also increasing with decreasing stellar metallicity, allowing for the pure signature of unique nucleosynthesis processes to be revealed. In this work, we report the atmospheric parameters, main dynamic properties, and the abundances of four metal-poor stars: HE 1523--0901, HD 6268, HD 121135, and HD 195636 (--1.5 > [Fe/H] >--3.0). The abundances were derived from spectra obtained with the HRS echelle spectrograph at the SALT, using both LTE and NLTE approaches. Based on their kinematical properties, we show that HE 1523--0901 and HD 195636 are halo stars with typical high velocities. In particular, HD 121135 displays a peculiar kinematical behaviour, making it unclear whether it is a halo or an accreted star. Furthermore, HD 6268 is possibly a rare prototype of very metal-poor thick disk stars. The abundances derived for our stars are compared with theoretical stellar models and with other stars with similar metallicity values from the literature. HD 121135 is Al-poor and Sc-poor, compared to stars observed in the same metallicity range (--1.62 > [Fe/H] >--1.12). The most metal-poor stars in our sample, HE 1523 -- 0901, HD 6268, and HD 195636, exhibit anomalies that are better explained by supernova models from fast-rotating stellar progenitors for elements up to the Fe group. Compared to other stars in the same metallicity range, their common biggest anomaly is represented by the low Sc abundances. If we consider the elements beyond Zn, HE 1523--0901 can be classified as an r-II star, HD 6268 as an r-I candidate, and HD 195636 and HD 121135 exhibiting a borderline r-process enrichment between limited-r and r-I star.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new CO observation toward the Type Ia supernova remnant (SNR) 3C 397 using the Nobeyama 45-m radio telescope at an unprecedent angular resolution of $\sim$18''. We newly found that the CO cloud at $V_{\mathrm{LSR}}$ = 55.7-62.2 km s$^{-1}$ (60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud) shows a good spatial correspondence with the radio continuum shell. We also found an expanding gas motion of the 60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud with an expansion velocity of $\sim$3 km s$^{-1}$, which is thought to be formed by the pre-and/or post-supernova feedback. By considering the positions of Galactic spiral arms and the X-ray/HI absorption studies, we concluded that 3C 397 is physically associated with the 60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud rather than the previously known CO cloud at $V_{\mathrm{LSR}}$ $\sim$30 km s$^{-1}$. Given that the previously measured pre-shock density is $\sim$2-5 cm$^{-3}$, the expanding motion of the 60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud was likely formed by the pre-supernova feedback known as optically thick wind. The scenario is consistent with that 3C 397 exploded inside a wind-blown bubble as a single degenerate system.

          Klein-Nishina Corrections to the Spectra and Light Curves of Gamma-ray Burst Afterglows

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-wavelength modeling of the synchrotron radiation from relativistic transients such as Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) afterglows is a powerful means of exploring the physics of relativistic shocks and of deriving properties of the explosion, such as the kinetic energy of the associated relativistic outflows. Capturing the location and evolution of the synchrotron cooling break is critical to break parameter degeneracies associated with such modeling. However, the shape of the spectrum above the cooling break, as well as the location and evolution of the break itself can be significantly altered by synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) cooling. We present an observer's guide to applying SSC cooling with and without Klein-Nishina (KN) corrections to GRB afterglow modeling. We provide a publicly available python code to calculate the Compton $Y$-parameter as a function of electron Lorentz factor, from which we compute changes to the electron distribution, along with KN-corrected afterglow spectra and light curves. In this framework, the canonical synchrotron spectral shapes split into multiple sub-regimes. We summarize each new spectral shape and describe its observational significance. We discuss how KN corrections can account for harder spectra and shallower decline rates observed in some GRB X-ray afterglows. Our overall aim is to provide an easy application of SSC+KN corrections into analytical multi-wavelength modeling frameworks for relativistic transients.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of Keplerian rotation is rare among Class 0 protostellar systems. We have investigated the high-density tracer HCN as a probe of the inner disk in a Class 0 proto-brown dwarf candidate. Our ALMA high angular resolution observations show the peak in the HCN (3-2) line emission arises from a compact component near the proto-brown dwarf with a small bar-like structure and a deconvolved size of $\sim$50 au. Radiative transfer modelling indicates that this HCN feature is tracing the innermost, dense regions in the proto-brown dwarf where a small Keplerian disk is expected to be present. The limited velocity resolution of the observations, however, makes it difficult to confirm the rotational kinematics of this feature. A brightening in the HCN emission towards the core center suggests that HCN can survive in the gas phase in the inner, dense regions of the proto-brown dwarf. In contrast, modelling of the HCO$^{+}$ (3-2) line emission indicates that it originates from the outer pseudo-disk/envelope region and is centrally depleted. HCN line emission can reveal the small-scale structures and can be an efficient observational tool to study the inner disk properties in such faint compact objects where spatially resolving the disk is nearly impossible.

 The main goal of this study is to screen the PENELLOPE/UVES targets for outflow activity and find microjets via spectro-astrometry in, e.g., the [OI]$\lambda$6300 line. In total, 34 T\,Tauri stars of the PENELLOPE survey have been observed with the high resolution slit spectrograph UVES in three different slit positions rotated by $120^\text{o}$. Our spectro-astrometric analysis in the [OI]$\lambda$6300 wind line reveals two newly discovered microjets associated with Sz\,103 and XX\,Cha. Both microjets have an extent of about $0.04$ arcseconds, that is, $<10\,\text{au}$, and we confined their orientation by the three slit observations. Furthermore, we confirm the binary nature of VW\,Cha and CVSO\,109. We present (further) evidence that DK\,Tau\,B and CVSO\,104\,A are spectroscopic binaries. Sz\,115 is tentatively a spectroscopic binary. The origin of the LVC, that is, MHD winds versus photoevaporative winds, of the Sz\,103 and XX\,Cha microjets remains unclear.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the effects of massive primordial black holes (PBHs) on cosmic structure formation, employing both a semi-analytical approach and cosmological simulations. Our simulations incorporate PBHs with a monochromatic mass distribution centered around $10^6 \ \rm M_{\odot}$, constituting a fraction of $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-4}$ of the dark matter (DM) in the universe, with the remainder being collision-less particle dark matter (PDM). Additionally, we conduct a $\Lambda$CDM simulation for comparative analysis with runs that include PBHs. At smaller scales, halos containing PBHs exhibit similar density and velocity dispersion profiles to those without PBHs. Conversely, at larger scales, PBHs can expedite the formation of massive halos and reside at their centers due to the `seed effect'. To analyze the relative distribution of PBH host halos compared to non-PBH halos, we apply nearest-neighbor (NN) statistics. Our results suggest that PBH host halos, through gravitational influence, significantly impact the structure formation process, compared to the $\Lambda$CDM case, by attracting and engulfing nearby newly-formed minihalos. Should PBHs constitute a fraction of DM significantly larger than $\sim$$10^{-3}$, almost all newly-formed halos will be absorbed by PBH-seeded halos. Consequently, our simulations predict a bimodal feature in the halo mass function, with most of the massive halos containing at least one PBH at their core and the rest being less massive non-PBH halos.

 The exploration of the universe is experiencing a huge development thanks to the success and possibilities of today's major space telescope missions which can generate measurements and images with a resolution 100 times higher than their precedents. This big ecosystem of observations, aimed at expanding the limits of known science, can be analyzed using personal computers thanks to the implementation of interoperable Virtual Observatory (VO) technologies and massive portals of stellar catalogs and databases. In this context of global analysis of astronomical big data, sonification has the potential of adding a complementary dimension to visualization, enhancing the accessibility of the archives, and offering an alternative strategy to be used when overlapping issues and masking effects are found in purely graphical representations. This article presents a collection of sonification and musification prototypes that explore the case studies of the MILES and STELIB stellar libraries from the Spanish Virtual Observatory (SVO), and the Kepler Objects of Interest light curve database from the Space Telescope Science Institute archive (STScI). The work makes use of automation, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms to offer a palette of resources that could be used in future developments oriented towards an auditory virtual observatory proposal. It includes a user study that provides qualitative and quantitative feedback from specialized and non-specialized users in the fields of Music and Astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Biosignature detection in the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets is one of the most significant and ambitious goals for astronomy, astrobiology, and humanity. Molecular oxygen is among the strongest indicators of life on Earth, but it will be extremely difficult to detect via transmission spectroscopy. We used the Bioverse statistical framework to assess the ability to probe Earth-like O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ levels on hypothetical nearby habitable zone exoplanets (EECs) using direct imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy on the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) and the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). We found that O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ could be probed on up to $\sim$5 and $\sim$15 EECs orbiting bright M dwarfs within 20 pc in a 10-year survey on the GMT and ELT, respectively. Earth-like O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ levels could be probed on four known super-Earth candidates, including Proxima Centauri b, within about one week on the ELT and a few months on the GMT. We also assessed the ability of the ELT to test the habitable zone oxygen hypothesis $\unicode{x2013}$ that habitable zone Earth-sized planets are more likely to have O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ $\unicode{x2013}$ within a 10-year survey using Bioverse. Testing this hypothesis requires either $\sim$1/2 of the EECs to have O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ or $\sim$1/3 if $\eta_{\oplus}$ is large. A northern hemisphere large-aperture telescope, such as the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), would expand the target star pool by about 25%, reduce the time to probe biosignatures on individual targets, and provide an additional independent check on potential biosignature detections.

 - **Abstract**
 We report measurements of trigonometric parallax and proper motion for two 6.7 GHz methanol and two 22 GHz water masers located in the far portion of the Sagittarius spiral arm as part of the BeSSeL Survey. Distances for these sources are estimated from parallax measurements combined with 3-dimensional kinematic distances. The distances of G033.64$-$00.22, G035.57$-$00.03, G041.15$-$00.20, and G043.89$-$00.78 are $9.9\pm0.5$, $10.2\pm0.6$, $7.6\pm0.5$, and $7.5\pm0.3$ kpc, respectively. Based on these measurements, we suggest that the Sagittarius arm segment beyond about 8 kpc from the Sun in the first Galactic quadrant should be adjusted radially outward relative to previous models. This supports the suggestion of Xu et al. (2023) that the Sagittarius and Perseus spiral arms might merge in the first quadrant before spiraling inward to the far end of the Galactic bar.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the structure of relativistic, low-angular momentum, inviscid advective accretion flow in a stationary axisymmetric Kerr-like wormhole (WH) spacetime, characterized by the spin parameter ($a_{\rm k}$), the dimensionless parameter ($\beta$), and the source mass ($M_{\rm WH}$). In doing so, we self-consistently solve the set of governing equations describing the relativistic accretion flow around a Kerr-like WH in the steady state, and for the first time, we obtain all possible classes of global accretion solutions for transonic as well as subsonic flows. We study the properties of dynamical and thermodynamical flow variables and examine how the nature of the accretion solutions alters due to the change of the model parameters, namely energy ($\mathcal{E}$), angular momentum ($\lambda$), $a_{\rm k}$, and $\beta$. Further, we separate the parameter space in $\lambda-\mathcal{E}$ plane according to the nature of the flow solutions, and study the modification of the parameter space by varying $a_{\rm k}$ and $\beta$. Moreover, we retrace the parameter space in $a_{\rm k}-\beta$ plane that allows accretion solutions containing multiple critical points. Finally, we calculate the disc luminosity ($L$) considering free-free emissions for transonic solutions as these solutions are astrophysically relevant and discuss the implication of this model formalism in the context of astrophysical applications.

          Solar image quality assessment: a proof of concept using Variance of Laplacian method and its application to optical atmospheric condition monitoring

 - **Abstract**
 Here we present a proof of concept for the application of the Variance of Laplacian (VL) method in quantifying the sharpness of optical solar images. We conducted a comprehensive study using over 65,000 individual solar images acquired on more than 160 days. Each image underwent processing using a VL image processing algorithm, which assigns a 'score' based on the sharpness of the solar disk's edges. We studied the scores obtained from images acquired at different conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the sharpness of the images exhibits daily trends that are closely linked to the altitude of the Sun at the observation site. We observed a significant degradation in image quality only below a certain altitude threshold. Furthermore, we compared airmass formulae from the literature with our sharpness observations and concluded that the degradation could be modeled as an Image Sharpness Function (ISF), which exhibits similarities to airmass variations. In addition to assessing image quality, our method has the potential to evaluate the optical atmospheric conditions during daytime observations. Moreover, this technique can be easily and cost-effectively applied to archival or real-time images of other celestial bodies, such as the Moon, bright planets and defocused stars. Given that ISF is unique to each location and sensitive to sky conditions, the development of an ISF is not only beneficial for routine observation preparation but also essential for long-term site monitoring.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high resolution (0.06 A/px) spectroscopic observations of the recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis obtained during the last 1.5 years (September 2022 -- January 2024), with the 2.0m RCC telecope of the Rozhen National Astronomical Observatory, Bulgaria. Double-peaked emission is visible in the H-alpha line after the end of the superactive state. We subtract the red giant contribution and measure the distance between the peaks ($\Delta v_a$) of the line. For the period July 2023 -- January 2024, we find that $\Delta v_a$ is in range $90 < \Delta v_a < 120$ km/s. Assuming that the emission is from the accretion disc around the white dwarf, we find average radius of the accretion disc $R_{disc} = 89 \pm 19$ R$_\odot$, which is approximately equal to the Roche lobe size of the white dwarf. Our results indicate that tidal torque plays an important role but that the disc can extend up to the Roche lobe of the accreting star.

 In this letter, we report the observational constraints on a Bianchi type I anisotropic extension of $w$CDM model with spatial curvature from observational data including Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Cosmic chronometers (CC), Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), Pantheon+ (PP) compilation of SNe Ia and SH0ES Cepheid host distance anchors. The anisotropy is found to be of the order $10^{-13}$, which interplay with spatial curvature to reduce $H_0$ tension by $\sim 1\sigma$ as found in the analyses with BAO+CC+BBN+PP combination of data, while no significant effect of anisotropy is observed with BAO+CC+BBN+PPSH0ES combination of data. A closed Universe is favored by $w$CDM as well as anisotropic $w$CDM models with spatial curvature in analyses with BAO+CC+BBN+PP combination of data. An observation of an open Universe from $w$CDM model with spatial curvature in analyses with BAO+CC+BBN+PPSH0ES combination of data and a closed Universe from anisotropic $w$CDM model with curvature in analyses with same combination of data is made. The quintessence form of dark energy is favored at 95\% CL in both analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic center lobe (GCL) is a $\sim 1^\circ$ object located north of the Galactic center. In the mid-infrared (MIR), the GCL appears as two 8.0-micron filaments that roughly define an ellipse. There is strong 24-micron and radio continuum emission in the interior of the ellipse. Due to its morphology and location in the sky, previous authors have argued that the GCL is created by outflows from star formation in the central molecular zone or by activity of the central black hole Sgr~A$^*$. We present images of the GCL from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array survey in radio continuum that show thermal absorption against the Galactic center, incompatible with an interpretation of synchrotron self-absorption. Estimates of the cosmic ray emissivity in this direction allow us to place a distance constraint on the GCL. To be consistent with standard emissivity assumptions, the GCL would be located 2kpc away. At a distance of 8kpc, the synchrotron background emissivity is enhanced by $\sim75$% in the direction of the GCL. We also present radio recombination line data from the Green Bank Telescope that constrains the electron temperature and line widths in this region, which are also more explicable if the GCL lies relatively close.

 - **Abstract**
 Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs) are very important massive stars. However, their origin and the observed binary fraction within the entire WR population are still debated. We investigate some possible merger channels for the formation of WRs, including main sequence (MS)/ Hertzsprung Gap (HG) + MS, He + HG/ Giant Branch (GB). We find that many products produced via binary merger can evolve into WRs, the MS/ HG + MS merger channel can explain WRs with luminosities higher than $\sim 10^{5.4}$\,L$_{\odot}$, while the He + HG/ GB merger channel can explain low-luminosity WRs in the range of $10^{4.7}$\,L$_{\odot}$\,$\sim$\,$10^{5.5}$\,L$_{\odot}$. In the population synthesis analysis of WRs, we assume an initial binary fraction ($f_{\rm ini,bin}$) of 50\% and 100\% for massive stars. We also assume that MS/ HG + MS merger products are non-rotating or rapidly rotating ($\omega/\omega_{\rm crit}=0.8$). In different cases, the calculated single fractions of WRs range from $22.2\%$ to $60.6\%$ in the Milky Way (MW) and from $8.3\%$ to $70.9\%$ in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The current observations fall within the range of our calculations. When the merger product of MS/HG+MS rotates rapidly, we estimate that there are approximately 1015 to 1396 WRs in the MW and 128 to 204 WRs in the LMC. Our model also roughly reproduces the observed single-peak luminosity distribution of WRs in the MW. However, the weak bimodal luminosity distribution observed in the LMC is not reproduced in our model. We assess that this may be due to the model underestimating the mass-loss rate in the LMC. In conclusion, we consider that the binary merger is significant formation channel for WR formation, and can explain the observed high fraction of the single WRs in the total population.

 - **Abstract**
 Rapid-turn slow-roll inflationary trajectories have been shown to be an attractor in two-field models, provided the turn rate is near constant and larger than the slow-roll parameters. These trajectories can produce primordial spectra consistent with current observations on CMB scales. We present the generalized consistency condition for sustained rapid-turn inflationary trajectory with two fields, arbitrary field-space metric and potential valid for any value of the turn rate. This has to be supplemented by a second condition to ensure slow roll evolution. Both conditions together constitute a tool to identify inflationary trajectories with arbitrary values of the turning rate without having to solve the equations of motion. We present a Python package for the numerical identification of regions in field-space and parameter space that allow for rapid-turn trajectories.

 - **Abstract**
 The joint detection of the gravitational wave (GW) event GW170817 and the short-duration gamma-ray burst (SGRB) event GRB 170817A, marked the beginning of GW multi-messenger astronomy and confirmed that binary neutron star mergers are progenitors of at least some SGRBs. An estimated joint detection rate of 0.3 - 1.7 per year between the LIGO-Hanford, LIGO-Livingston and Virgo GW network at design sensitivity, and the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor was predicted. However, to date, the GW170817/GRB 170817A joint detection has been the only event of its kind so far. Taking into account that SGRBs are narrowly beamed and are emitted perpendicular to the orbital plane of the binary system, we propose that previous mergers involving neutron stars, were orientated such that observation of the emitted SGRB along this narrow jet was not possible. To support this hypothesis we have estimated the inclination of the binary systems for previously detected Binary Neutron Star (BNS) and Black Hole Neutron Star (BHNS) mergers through GW analysis. This analysis was performed using BILBY, a Python based Bayesian inference library, to estimate the inclination of the BNS events GW170817 and GW190425, and the BHNS events GW190917_114630 and GW200115_042309. The results obtained in this study indicate that these binaries may have had inclinations greater than $33^{\circ}$ with respect to the line of sight from Earth, an upper limit on the viewing angle set from observations of GRB 170817A. This then suggests that the observation of the emitted SGRB from these past mergers might not have been possible.

 - **Abstract**
 The positive evidence of a nano-hertz gravitational wave background recently found by several pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations opened up a window to test modified gravity theories in a unique frequency band in parallel to other gravitational wave detection experiments. In particular, the overlap reduction function (ORF) in PTA observation is sensitive to the phase velocity of gravitational waves. In this work, we provide analytical expressions for the coefficients of the multipole moments in the ORF, and utilize these analytical results to study constraints on the phase velocity from the frequency dependent overlap reduction function obtained from the Chinese PTA (CPTA) data. While the data contain large error bars yet, interesting constraints are found in the frequency-dependent ORF in the case of subluminal phase velocity. This makes us expect that the nano-hertz band gravitational wave background will become one of the important arenas for exploring modified gravity theories.

 We report the photometric analysis of SU UMa based on the observations of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). TESS has released a large amount of data, which contains the light curves of a complete superoutburst and three normal outbursts of SU UMa. Based on the observations, the evolution of superhumps during the superoutburst was analyzed. By using the O - C method, the three stages were determined, and the superhump period for each stage was calculated. The mass ratio $q=0.137 (1)$ was estimated based on the stage A superhump method. A periodic oscillation with a period of 2.17(9) days was found in the superhump minimum O - C diagram, which is related to the precession of the accretion disk. We investigated the frequency information of quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) in the light curves. An ultralong period QPO of 0.18 days at the time of normal outburst and two ultralong periods QPOs of 0.19 days and 0.285 days in quiescence were found. No QPO was found in the superoutburst.

 We report the superhumps analysis of seven SU UMa-type dwarf novae based on the observations of Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Superhumps are seen during superoutbursts of SU UMa-type dwarf novae. The month-long data sets of TESS are well suited for studying the variation of superhumps. We selected seven non-eclipsing SU UMa-type dwarf novae with superhumps in which TESS light curves are available and have not yet been studied. The stages A, B, and C of superhumps in superoutbursts were determined by O-C method. The results indicate that not all complete superoutbursts show obvious three stages, such as DT Oct and the second superoutburst of J1730+6247. We calculated the superhump periods for each stage and the mean periods for whole superoutbursts. Taking the stage A superhump method, the mass ratios (M2/M1) were estimated. According to the results, the seven stars are pre-bounce systems with mass ratios ranging from 0.1 to 0.2. By combining the orbital periods and the mean superhump periods, the precession periods were calculated. The results show that the precession periods of the seven SU UMa stars are about 2 days.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the description and initial results of the TRAPUM (TRAnsients And PUlsars with MeerKAT) search for pulsars associated with supernova remnants (SNRs), pulsar wind nebulae and unidentified TeV emission. The list of sources to be targeted includes a large number of well-known candidate pulsar locations but also new candidate SNRs identified using a range of criteria. Using the 64-dish MeerKAT radio telescope, we use an interferometric beamforming technique to tile the potential pulsar locations with coherent beams which we search for radio pulsations, above a signal-to-noise of 9, down to an average flux density upper limit of 30 $\mu$Jy. This limit is target-dependent due to the contribution of the sky and nebula to the system temperature. Coherent beams are arranged to overlap at their 50 per cent power radius, so the sensitivity to pulsars is not degraded by more than this amount, though realistically averages around 65 per cent if every location in the beam is considered. We report the discovery of two new pulsars; PSR J1831$-$0941 is an adolescent pulsar likely to be the plerionic engine of the candidate PWN G20.0+0.0, and PSR J1818$-$1502 appears to be an old and faint pulsar that we serendipitously discovered near the centre of a SNR already hosting a compact central object. The survey holds importance for better understanding of neutron star birth rates and the energetics of young pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 We studied the optical variability of 241 BL Lacs and 83 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) from the 4LAC catalog using data from the Tomo-e Gozen Northern Sky Transient Survey, with $\sim$ 50 epochs per blazar on average. We excluded blazars whose optical variability may be underestimated due to the influence of their host galaxy, based on their optical luminosity ($L_O$). FSRQs with $\gamma$-ray photon index greater than 2.6 exhibit very low optical variability, and their distribution of standard deviation of repeated photometry is significantly different from that of the other FSRQs (KS test P value equal to $5 \times 10^{-6}$ ). Among a sample of blazars at any particular cosmological epoch, those with lower $\gamma$-ray luminosity ($L_\gamma$) tend to have lower optical variability, and those FSRQs with $\gamma$-ray photon index greater than 2.6 tend to have low $L_\gamma$. We also measured the structure function of optical variability and found that the amplitude of the structure function for FSRQs is higher than previously measured and higher than that of BL Lacs at multiple time lags. Additionally, the amplitude of the structure function of FSRQs with high $\gamma$-ray photon index is significantly lower than that of FSRQs with low $\gamma$-ray photon index. The structure function of FSRQs of high $\gamma$-ray photon index shows a characteristic timescale of more than 10 days, which may be the variability timescale of the accretion disk. In summary, we infer that the optical component of FSRQs with high $\gamma$-ray photon index may be dominated by the accretion disk.

          Binary neutron star mergers as the source of the highest energy cosmic rays

 - **Abstract**
 We propose that ultrahigh energy cosmic rays are produced in binary neutron star mergers. Interpreting the highest energy events as r-process nuclei eliminates the need for exotic sources, while the observed near-universal maximum rigidity of ultrahigh energy sources can be understood as due to the uniformity of jets generated by the gravitationally-driven dynamo, given the narrow range of total binary neutron star masses. We discuss evidence for this scenario, and its prediction of coincidences between neutrinos above 10 PeV and gravitational waves.

 - **Abstract**
 The sensitivity of the MeerKAT radio interferometer is an opportunity to probe deeper into the population of rare and faint extragalactic pulsars. The TRAPUM (TRAnsients and PUlsars with MeerKAT) collaboration has conducted a radio-domain search for accelerated pulsars and transients in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). This partially targeted survey, performed at L-band (856-1712 MHz) with the core array of the MeerKAT telescope in 2-h integrations, is twice as sensitive as the latest SMC radio pulsar survey. We report the discovery of seven new SMC pulsars, doubling this galaxy's radio pulsar population and increasing the total extragalactic population by nearly a quarter. We also carried out a search for accelerated millisecond pulsars in the SMC Globular Cluster NGC 121 using the full array of MeerKAT. This improved the previous upper limit on pulsed radio emission from this cluster by a factor of six. Our discoveries reveal the first radio pulsar-PWN systems in the SMC, with only one such system previously known outside our galaxy (the "Crab pulsar twin" in the Large Magellanic Cloud, PSR J0540$-$6919). We associate the 59 ms pulsar discovery PSR J0040$-$7337, now the fastest spinning radio pulsar in the SMC, with the bow-shock Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN) of Supernova Remnant DEM S5. We also present a new young pulsar with a 79 ms period, PSR J0048$-$7317, in a PWN recently discovered in a MeerKAT radio continuum image. Using the multi-beam capability of MeerKAT, we localised our pulsar discoveries, and two previous Murriyang discoveries, to a positional uncertainty of a few arcseconds.

 Understanding the formation history of planets is one of the goals of studying exoplanet atmospheres. The atmospheric composition of planets can provide insights into the formation pathways of planets. Even though the mapping of the atmospheric composition onto a formation pathway is not unambiguous, with the increasing sensitivity of modern instruments, we can derive promising constraints. In this work, we aim to understand the formation pathway of WASP-39b. We discuss whether the detection of SO2 in its atmosphere would impact our understanding of the formation of the planet and whether it enables us to determine the formation pathway of the planet with greater accuracy. We used the JWST transit observation of the planet together with the available HST and Spitzer observations. We used a formation model coupled with a radiative transfer retrieval model to derive the planet's atmospheric characteristics and formation history. Furthermore, we used a photochemical model to derive the impact of photochemistry on the atmosphere of the planet. In this work, we show that the planet is most likely to have initiated beyond the CO2 ice line of its natal disk. Furthermore, the planet is likely to have have accreted some planetesimals during its formation. We show that the sulfur abundance in the atmosphere of the planet is probably lower than $2.27 \times 10^{-4}$. This abundance indicates that the planet is likely to exhibit a lower metallicity than suggested by the retrievals. Furthermore, such an abundance for sulfur is more likely if WASP-39b had been formed beyond the CO ice line of its natal disk.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the theoretical possibility of accurately determining the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ from precise observations of double lined eclipsing binary systems. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we drew synthetic binary systems with masses between 0.85 and 1.00 $M_{\odot}$ from a grid of stellar models with $\Delta Y/\Delta Z = 2.0$ [...]. Subsequently, a broader grid with $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ from 1.0 to 3.0 was used in the fitting process. To account for observational uncertainties, two scenarios were explored: S1 with realistic uncertainties of 100 K in temperature and 0.1 dex in [Fe/H], and S2 with halved uncertainties. We repeated the simulation at two baseline metallicities: [Fe/H] = 0.0 and -0.3. The posterior distributions of $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ were severely biased towards the edge of the allowable range in the S1 errors scenario. The situation only marginally improved when considering the S2 scenario. The effect is due to the impact of changing $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ in the stellar effective temperature and its interplay with [Fe/H] observational error, and it is therefore not restricted to the specific fitting method. Despite the presence of these systematic discrepancies, the age of the systems were recovered unbiased with 10% precision. Our findings indicate that the observational uncertainty in effective temperature and metallicity significantly hinders the accurate determination of the $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ parameter from main sequence binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The analysis of strong lensing images usually involves an external convergence and shear, which are meant to model the effect of perturbations along the line of sight, on top of the main lens. Such a description of line-of-sight perturbations supposes that the corresponding gravitational fields can be treated in the tidal regime. Going one step further introduces additional effects, known as flexion, which have been hitherto neglected in strong lensing. In this work, we build a minimal model for the line-of-sight flexion, which adds four new complex parameters to the lens model. Contrary to convergence and shear, the line-of-sight flexion cannot be projected onto the main lens plane. For a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we predict the typical line-of-sight flexion to be on the order of $10^{-3} \mathrm{arcsec}^{-1}$ on galactic scales. Neglecting its effect in lens modelling is found to bias the recovery of other parameters; in particular, the line-of-sight shear can be biased up to $2\sigma$. Accounting for the line-of-sight flexion in our minimal framework restores accuracy, at the the cost of degrading precision. With current imaging capabilities, the line-of-sight flexion is unlikely to be measurable on individual strong lensing images; it must therefore be considered a nuisance parameter rather than an observable in its own right.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of silicon monosulfide (SiS) in space appears to be a difficult process, but the present work is showing that a previously excluded pathway may contribute to its astronomical abundance. Reaction of the radicals SH + SiH produces SiS with a submerged transition state and generates a stabilizing H$_2$ molecule as a product to dissipate the kinetic energy. Such is a textbook chemical reaction for favorable gas-phase chemistry. While previously proposed mechanisms reacting atomic sulfur and silicon with SiH, SH, and H$_2$S will still be major contributors to the production of SiS, an abundance of SiS in certain regions could be a marker for the presence of SiH where it has previously been unobserved. These quantum chemically-computed reaction profiles imply that the silicon-chalcogen chemistry of molecular clouds, shocked regions, or protoplanetary disks may be richer than previously thought. Quantum chemical spectral data for the intermediate cis- and trans-HSiSH are also provided in order to aid in their potential spectroscopic characterization.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic microwave background (CMB), a remnant of the Big Bang, provides unparalleled insights into the primordial universe, its energy content, and the origin of cosmic structures. The success of forthcoming terrestrial and space experiments hinges on meticulously calibrated data. Specifically, the ability to achieve an absolute calibration of the polarization angles with a precision of < 0.1 deg is crucial to identify the signatures of primordial gravitational waves and cosmic birefringence within the CMB polarization. We introduce the COSMOCal project, designed to deploy a polarized source in space for calibrating microwave frequency observations. The project aims to integrate microwave polarization observations from small and large telescopes, ground-based and in space, into a unified scale, enhancing the effectiveness of each observatory and allowing robust combination of data. To demonstrate the feasibility and confirm the observational approach of our project, we developed a prototype instrument that operates in the atmospheric window centered at 260 GHz, specifically tailored for use with the NIKA2 camera at the IRAM 30 m telescope. We present the instrument components and their laboratory characterization. The results of tests performed with the fully assembled prototype using a KIDs-based instrument, similar concept of NIKA2, are also reported. This study paves the way for an observing campaign using the IRAM 30m telescope and contributes to the development of a space-based instrument.

 - **Abstract**
 Eclipsing Compact Hierarchical Triples (ECHTs) are systems with the tertiary star orbiting an eclipsing binary (EB) in an orbit of fewer than 1000 days. In a CHT, all three stars exist in a space less than 5 AU in separation. A low-mass CHT is an interesting case to understand multiple star and planet formation at such small scales. In this study, we combine spectroscopy and photometry to estimate the orbital, stellar and atmospheric parameters of stars in a sample of CHTs. Using the complete set of parameters we aim to constrain the metallicity and age of the systems. We use time-series spectroscopy to obtain radial velocities (RVs) and disentangled spectra. Using RV modelling, EB light curve modelling, and spectral analysis, we estimated the metallicities and temperatures. Using isochrone fitting, we constrain the ages of the system. We then combine observations of masses, outer eccentricities (e_2), orbital periods and age estimates of the systems from the literature. We compare the distributions of e_2, and tertiary mass ratio, q_3 = M_3/(M_1+M_2), for three different metallicity ranges and two ranges of age. We estimate masses, radii, temperatures, metallicities and age of 12 stars in 4 CHTs. The CHT CD-32 6459 shows signs of von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations while CD-62 1257 can evolve to form a triple common envelope. The rest of the CHTs are old and have an M-dwarf tertiary. We find that the q_3 distribution for CHTs with sub-solar metallicity has a uniform distribution but the systems with solar and above-solar metallicity peak between 0.5 and 1. When dividing them according to their ages, we found the q_3 of old systems around 0.5. The eccentricity e_2 favours a value around 0.3 irrespective of metallicity or age. The distributions are biased by the lack of observations and observing methods and therefore call for more observations of low-mass CHT.

 - **Abstract**
 NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) has initiated a program to enhance the participation of historically underrepresented institutions and communities in NASA's mission. Currently known as the NASA SMD Bridge Program, its goal is to establish enduring partnerships among these institutions, research-intensive universities, and NASA centers. There are concerns about using "Bridge" in the program's name, with stakeholders suggesting that it might stigmatize students and mislead applicants about its focus. In this white paper, we address these concerns and conclude that a name change that better reflects the mission of this SMD effort is necessary to address these concerns.

          2D vs. 3D BAO: quantification of their tension and test of the Etherington relation

 - **Abstract**
 Several studies in the literature have found a disagreement between data on Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) derived using two distinct methodologies: the two-dimensional (2D or angular) BAO, which extracts the BAO signal from the analysis of the angular two-point correlation function; and the three-dimensional (3D or anisotropic) BAO, which also exploits the radial clustering signal imprinted on the large-scale structure of the universe. This discrepancy is worrisome, since many of the points contained in these data sets are obtained from the same catalogs of tracers and, therefore, we would expect them to be consistent. Since BAO measurements play a pivotal role in the building of the inverse distance ladder, this mismatch impacts the discourse on the Hubble tension and the theoretical solutions to the latter. So far, the discrepancy between 2D and 3D BAO has been only pointed out in the context of fitting analyses of cosmological models or parametrizations that involve a concrete calibration of the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch. In this Letter, we avoid the use of any calibration and cosmological model in the process. At this point we assume that the Etherington (a.k.a distance duality) relation holds. We use state-of-the-art measurements in our analysis, and study how the results change when the angular components of the 3D BAO data from BOSS/eBOSS are substituted by the recent data from DESI Y1. We find the tension to exist at the level of $\sim 2\sigma$ and $\sim 2.5\sigma$, respectively. We then apply a calibrator-independent method to investigate the robustness of the distance duality relation when analyzed not only with 3D BAO measurements, but also with 2D BAO. We do not find any hint for a violation of the cosmic distance duality relation in any of the considered data sets, although they leave still room for departures from it. [abridged]

          Comparing sharp and smooth transition of the second slow-roll parameter in single-field inflation

 - **Abstract**
 In single-field inflation, violation of the slow-roll approximation can lead to growth of curvature perturbation outside the horizon. This violation is characterized by a period with a large negative value of the second slow-roll parameter. At an early time, inflation must satisfy the slow-roll approximation, so the large-scale curvature perturbation can explain the cosmic microwave background fluctuations. At intermediate time, it is viable to have a theory that violates the slow-roll approximation, which implies amplification of the curvature perturbation on small scales. Specifically, we consider ultraslow-roll inflation as the intermediate period. At late time, inflation should go back to the slow roll period so that it can end. This means that there are two transitions of the second slow-roll parameter. In this paper, we compare two different possibilities for the second transition: sharp and smooth transitions. Focusing on effects generated by the relevant cubic self-interaction of the curvature perturbation, we find that the bispectrum and one-loop correction to the power spectrum due to the change of the second slow-roll parameter vanish if and only if the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation for perturbation satisfies a specific condition called Wands duality. We also find in the case of sharp transition that, even though this duality is satisfied in the ultraslow-roll and slow-roll phases, it is severely violated at the transition so that the resultant one-loop correction is extremely large inversely proportional to the duration of the transition.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to produce appreciable amount of primordial black holes (PBHs), the square amplitude of curvature perturbation must take a large value of $\mathcal{O}(0.01)$, namely, seven digits larger than the value observed by cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) on large scales. Such a large fluctuation can be achieved by violating slow-roll (SR) condition within a short duration. The best known of such possibilities is the ultraslow-roll (USR) inflation. We calculate the power spectrum of curvature perturbation in a simple single-field inflation model which evolves through SR-USR-SR regimes so that both large-amplitude small-scale fluctuation for PBH formation and small-amplitude large-scale fluctuation as observed by CMB are realized. We further calculate the bispectrum and one-loop correction to the power spectrum induced by the third-order action of curvature perturbation as the beginning of precision cosmology on small scale. As a result we show that single-field inflation model realizing PBH formation is severely constrained by the quantum correction.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in high-redshift luminous quasars may require a phase of rapid accretion, and as a precondition, substantial gas influx toward seed black holes (BHs) from kilo-parsec or parsec scales. Our previous research demonstrated the plausibility of such gas supply for BH seeds within star-forming giant molecular clouds (GMCs) with high surface density ($\sim 10^4\,{\rm {\rm M_\odot}\, pc}^{-2}$), facilitating ``hyper-Eddington'' accretion via efficient feeding by dense clumps which are driven by turbulence and stellar feedback. This article investigates the impacts of feedback from accreting BHs on this process, including radiation, mechanical jets, and highly relativistic cosmic rays. We run a suite of numerical simulations to explore diverse parameter spaces of BH feedback, including the sub-grid accretion model, feedback energy efficiency, mass loading factor, and initial metallicity. Utilizing radiative feedback models inferred from the slim disk, we find that hyper-Eddington accretion is still achievable, yielding BH bolometric luminosities as high as $10^{41}$ -- $10^{44}\,\rm erg/s$, depending on the GMC properties and specific feedback model assumed. We find the maximum possible mass growth of seed BHs ($\Delta M_{\rm BH}^{\rm max}$) is regulated by the momentum deposition rate from BH feedback, $\dot{p}_{\rm feedback}/(\dot{M}_{\rm BH} c)$, which leads to an analytic scaling that agrees well with simulations. This scenario predicts the rapid formation of $\sim 10^4\,\rm M_\odot$ intermediate-massive BHs (IMBHs) from stellar-mass BHs within $\sim \rm Myr$. Furthermore, we examine the impacts of sub-grid accretion models and how BH feedback may influence star formation within these cloud complexes.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a modified moment matching algorithm to avoid catastrophic failures for sources with a low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The proposed modifications include a method to eliminate non-physical negative pixel values and a forced single iteration with an initial guess derived from co-add measurements when iterative methods are unstable. We correct for all biases in measurements introduced by the method. We find that the proposed modifications allow the algorithm to avoid catastrophic failures in nearly 100\% of the cases, especially at low signal to noise ratio. Additionally, with a reasonable guess from co-add measurements, the algorithm measures the flux, centroid, size, shape and ellipticity with bias statistically consistent with zero. We show the proposed method allows us to measure sources seven times fainter than traditional methods when applied to images obtained from WIYN-ODI. We also present a scheme to find uncertainties in measurements when using the new method to measure astronomical sources.

 - **Abstract**
 The optical depth parameterisation is typically used to study the 21-cm signals associated with the properties of the neutral hydrogen (HI) gas and the ionisation morphology during the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR), without solving the radiative transfer equation. To assess the uncertainties resulting from this simplification, we conduct explicit radiative transfer calculations using the cosmological 21-cm radiative transfer (C21LRT) code and examine the imprints of ionisation structures on the 21-cm spectrum. We consider a globally averaged reionisation history and implement fully ionised cavities (HII bubbles) of diameters $d$ ranging from 0.01 Mpc to 10 Mpc at epochs within the emission and the absorption regimes of the 21-cm global signal. The single-ray C21LRT calculations show that the shape of the imprinted spectral features are primarily determined by $d$ and the 21-cm line profile, which is parametrised by the turbulent velocity of the HI gas. It reveals the spectral features tied to the transition from ionised to neutral regions that calculations based on the optical depth parametrisation were unable to capture. We also present analytical approximations of the calculated spectral features of the HII bubbles. The multiple-ray calculations show that the apparent shape of a HII bubble (of $d=5$ Mpc at $z=8$), because of the finite speed of light, differs depending on whether the bubble's ionisation front is stationary or expanding. Our study shows the necessity of properly accounting for the effects of line-continuum interaction, line broadening and cosmological expansion to correctly predict the EoR 21-cm signals.
