          The Variability Structure Function of the Highest-Luminosity Quasars on Short Timescales

 - **Abstract**
 The stochastic photometric variability of quasars is known to follow a random-walk phenomenology on emission timescales of months to years. Some high-cadence restframe optical monitoring in the past has hinted at a suppression of variability amplitudes on shorter timescales of a few days or weeks, opening the question of what drives the suppression and how it might scale with quasar properties. Here, we study a few thousand of the highest-luminosity quasars in the sky, mostly in the luminosity range of $L_{\rm bol}=[46.4, 47.3]$ and redshift range of $z=[0.7, 2.4]$. We use a dataset from the NASA/ATLAS facility with nightly cadence, weather permitting, which has been used before to quantify strong regularity in longer-term restframe-UV variability. As we focus on a careful treatment of short timescales across the sample, we find that a linear function is sufficient to describe the UV variability structure function. Although the result can not rule out the existence of breaks in some groups completely, a simpler model is usually favoured under this circumstance. In conclusion, the data is consistent with a single-slope random walk across restframe timescales of $\Delta t=[10, 250]$ days.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. Recently, both the presence of multiple stellar chemo-kinematic components and rotation in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy have been put into question. Therefore, we re-examine the chemo-kinematic properties of this galaxy making use of the best spectroscopic data-set available containing both line-of-sight velocities and metallicities of individual stars. Methods. We carry out a detailed, quantitative analysis on the recent spectroscopic data-set from Tolstoy et al. (2023) that contains high precision velocities and metallicities for 1339 members of Sculptor. In particular, we assess whether Sculptor is best represented by a single stellar population with a negative metallicity gradient or by the super-position of two or more components with different mean metallicity, spatial distribution and kinematic properties. For this analysis, we also include the incompleteness of the spectroscopic data-set. Results. We find that Sculptor is better described by a two-populations model than by a single-population model with a metallicity gradient. Moreover, given the assumptions of the current modeling, we find evidence of a third population, composed of few stars, that is more extended and metal-poor than the two other populations. This very metal-poor group of stars shows a shift of around 15 km/s in its average l.o.s. velocity (vlos) with respect to the rest of the galaxy. We discuss several possible origins for this new population, finding a minor merger as the most likely one. We also find a vlos gradient of 4.0 +1.5 -1.5 km s-1 deg-1 but its statistical evidence is inconclusive and, moreover, its detection is partially driven by the group of stars with off-set velocities.

          Type IIn Supernovae. I. Uniform Light Curve Characterization and a Bimodality in the Radiated Energy Distribution

 - **Abstract**
 We present the largest uniform study to date of Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn), focusing in this first paper on the multi-band optical light curves of $487$ SNe IIn. The sample, constructed from multiple surveys, extends to $z \approx 0.8$, with the majority of events at $z \lesssim 0.3$. We construct uniform multi-band and bolometric light curves using Gaussian process regression, and determine key observed properties in the rest-frame (e.g., peak luminosity, timescales, radiated energy). We find that SNe IIn span broad ranges in peak luminosity ($\sim 10^{42}-10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$) and timescales ($\sim 20-300$ days above 50% of peak luminosity), but the sample divides into two clear groups in the luminosity-timescale phase-space around the median peak luminosity ($\approx 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$): faint-fast and luminous-slow groups. This leads to a strong bimodality in the radiated energy distribution, with peaks at $\sim 10^{49}$ and $\sim 2\times10^{50}$ erg, with the latter events having a characteristic timescale of $\sim 100$ days, and the former appearing to bifurcate into two branches with timescales of $\sim 40$ and $\sim 70$ days. Therefore, SNe IIn exhibit at least two dominant groupings, and perhaps three, which are likely reflective of different progenitor and/or circumstellar medium formation pathways. We do not find any obvious transition in SN IIn properties at the arbitrary cut-off of $\approx -20$ mag used for the designation "Type II Superluminous Supernovae", and we argue that this classification should be abandoned. The absence of SNe IIn with timescales of $\lesssim 14$ days defines the region occupied by fast transients with evidence for interaction with hydrogen-poor circumstellar medium.

          The formation of multiples in small-$N$ subclusters

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the relative percentages of binary systems and higher-order multiples that are formed by pure stellar dynamics, within a small subcluster of $N$ stars. The subcluster is intended to represent the fragmentation products of a single isolated core, after most of the residual gas of the natal core has dispersed. Initially the stars have random positions, and masses drawn from a log-normal distribution. For low-mass cores spawning multiple systems with Sun-like primaries, the best fit to the observed percentages of singles, binaries, triples and higher-order systems is obtained if a typical core spawns on average between $N=$ 4.3 and 5.2 stars, specifically a distribution of $N$ with mean $\mu_{_{N}}\sim4.8$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{_N}\sim2.4$. This fit is obtained when $\sim 50\%$ of the subcluster's internal kinetic energy is invested in ordered rotation and $\sim 50\%$ in isotropic Maxwellian velocities. There is little dependence on other factors, for example mass segregation or the rotation law. Whilst such high values of $N$ are at variance with the lower values often quoted (i.e. $N=$ 1 or 2), very similar values ($N=4.3\pm0.4$ and $N=4.5\pm1.9$) have been derived previously by completely independent routes, and seem inescapable when the observed distribution of multiplicities is taken into account.

          The impact of the cosmological constant on past and future star formation

 - **Abstract**
 We present an extended analytic model for cosmic star formation, with the aim of investigating the impact of cosmological parameters on the star formation history within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Constructing an ensemble of flat $\Lambda$CDM models where the cosmological constant varies between $\Lambda = 0$ and $10^5$ times the observed value, $\Lambda_{\rm obs}$, we find that the fraction of cosmic baryons that are converted into stars over the entire history of the universe peaks at $\sim$27% for $0.01 \lesssim \Lambda/\Lambda_{\rm obs} \lesssim 1$. We explain, from first principles, that the decline of this asymptotic star-formation efficiency for lower and higher values of $\Lambda$ is driven respectively by the astrophysics of star formation, and by the suppression of cosmic structure formation. However, the asymptotic efficiency declines slowly as $\Lambda$ increases, falling below 5% only for $\Lambda>100 \, \Lambda_{\rm obs}$. Making the minimal assumption that the probability of generating observers is proportional to this efficiency, and following Weinberg in adopting a flat prior on $\Lambda$, the median posterior value of $\Lambda$ is $539 \, \Lambda_{\rm obs}$. Furthermore, the probability of observing $\Lambda\leq \Lambda_{\rm obs}$ is only $0.5\%$. Although this work has not considered recollapsing models with $\Lambda<0$, the indication is thus that $\Lambda_{\rm obs}$ appears to be unreasonably small compared to the predictions of the simplest multiverse ensemble. This poses a challenge for anthropic reasoning as a viable explanation for cosmic coincidences and the apparent fine-tuning of the universe: either the approach is invalid, or more parameters than $\Lambda$ alone must vary within the ensemble.

 - **Abstract**
 Ground-based high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS; R >~ 15,000) is a powerful complement to space-based studies of exoplanet atmospheres. By resolving individual spectral lines, HRCCS can precisely measure chemical abundance ratios, directly constrain atmospheric dynamics, and robustly probe multidimensional physics. But the subtleties of HRCCS datasets -- e.g., the lack of exoplanetary spectra visible by eye and the statistically complex process of telluric removal -- can make interpreting them difficult. In this work, we seek to clarify the uncertainty budget of HRCCS with a forward-modeling approach. We present a HRCCS observation simulator, scope (this https URL), that incorporates spectral contributions from the exoplanet, star, tellurics, and instrument. This tool allows us to control the underlying dataset, enabling controlled experimentation with complex HRCCS methods. Simulating a fiducial hot Jupiter dataset (WASP-77Ab emission with IGRINS), we first confirm via multiple tests that the commonly used principal components analysis does not bias the planetary signal when few components are used. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mildly varying tellurics and moderate wavelength solution errors induce only mild decreases in HRCCS detection significance. However, limiting-case, strongly varying tellurics can bias the retrieved velocities and gas abundances. Additionally, in the low-SNR limit, constraints on gas abundances become highly non-Gaussian. Our investigation of the uncertainties and potential biases inherent in HRCCS data analysis enables greater confidence in scientific results from this maturing method.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational Wave (GW) sources offer a valuable window to the physical processes that govern the formation of binary compact objects (BCOs). However, deciphering such information from GW data is substantially challenging due to the difficulty in mapping from the space of observation to the space of numerous theoretical models. We introduce the concept of BCO Phase-Space that connects the observable space to the evolution trajectories of the BCO formation channels with cosmic time and apply it to the third GW transient catalog (GWTC-3) that brings new insights into probable astrophysical formation scenarios of nearly $90$ events. Our study reveals that two events, GW190425 and GW230529, show an overlap with a $\texttt{BCO Phase Space}$ trajectory of the same formation channel arising from a sub-solar mass black hole scenario that has grown into a higher mass by accretion, hinting towards the common primordial origin of both these sources. Though the actual formation channel is yet to be confirmed, with the availability of more GW events, the $\texttt{BCO Phase Space}$ can delve into distinguishing features of different formation channels for both astrophysical and primordial origin and opens the possibility of bringing new and deeper insights on the formation and evolution of BCOs across all observable masses over most of the cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 The Simons Observatory is a ground-based telescope array located at an elevation of 5200 meters, in the Atacama Desert in Chile, designed to measure the temperature and polarization of the cosmic microwave background. It comprises four telescopes: three 0.42-meter small aperture telescopes (SATs), focused on searching for primordial gravitational waves, and one 6-meter large aperture telescope, focused on studying small-scale perturbations. Each of the SATs will field over 12,000 TES bolometers, with two SATs sensitive to both 90 and 150GHz frequency bands (SAT-MF1, and SAT-MF2), while the third SAT is sensitive to 220 and 280GHz frequency bands. Prior to its deployment in 2023, the optical properties of SAT-MF1 were characterized in the laboratory. We report on measurements of near-field beam maps acquired using a thermal source along with measurements using a holographic method that enables characterization of the amplitude and phase of the beam response, yielding an estimate of the far-field radiation pattern received by SAT-MF1. We find that the near-field half-width-half-maximum (HWHM) requirements are met across the focal plane array for the 90GHz frequency band, and through most of the focal plane array for the 150GHz frequency band. The mean of the bandpass averaged HWHM of the edge-detector focal plane modules match the simulated HWHM to 10.4%, with the discrepancy caused by fringing in the simulation. The measured beam profiles match simulations to within 2dB from the beam center to at least the -10dB level. Holography estimates of the far-field 90GHz beams match the full-width-half-maximum from simulation within 1%, and the beam profiles deviate by less than 2dB inside the central lobe. The success of the holography and thermal beam map experiments confirmed the optical performance was sufficient to meet the science requirements. On-site observations are currently underway.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents an implementation of radio astronomy imaging algorithms on modern High Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructures, exploiting distributed memory parallelism and acceleration throughout multiple GPUs. Our code, called RICK (Radio Imaging Code Kernels), is capable of performing the major steps of the w-stacking algorithm presented in Offringa et al. (2014) both inter- and intra-node, and in particular has the possibility to run entirely on the GPU memory, minimising the number of data transfers between CPU and GPU. This feature, especially among multiple GPUs, is critical given the huge sizes of radio datasets involved. After a detailed description of the new implementations of the code with respect to the first version presented in Gheller et al. (2023), we analyse the performances of the code for each step involved in its execution. We also discuss the pros and cons related to an accelerated approach to this problem and its impact on the overall behaviour of the code. Such approach to the problem results in a significant improvement in terms of runtime with respect to the CPU version of the code, as long as the amount of computational resources does not exceed the one requested by the size of the problem: the code, in fact, is now limited by the communication costs, with the computation that gets heavily reduced by the capabilities of the accelerators.

          Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds I. Numerical Modeling and Evolution to Collapse

 - **Abstract**
 A fundamental issue in star formation is understanding the precise mechanisms leading to the formation of prestellar cores, and their subsequent gravitationally unstable evolution. To address this question, we carefully construct a suite of turbulent, self-gravitating numerical simulations, and analyze the development and collapse of individual prestellar cores. We show that the numerical requirements for resolving the sonic scale and internal structure of anticipated cores are essentially the same in self-gravitating clouds, calling for the number of cells per dimension to increase quadratically with the cloud's Mach number. In our simulations, we follow evolution of individual cores by tracking the region around each gravitational potential minimum over time. Evolution in nascent cores is towards increasing density and decreasing turbulence, and there is a wide range of critical density for initiating collapse. At given spatial scale the turbulence level also varies widely, and tends to be correlated with density. By directly measuring the radial forces acting within cores, we identify a distinct transition to a state of gravitational runaway. We use our new theory for turbulent equilibrium spheres to predict the onset of each core's collapse. Instability is expected when the critical radius becomes smaller than the tidal radius; we find good agreement with the simulations. Interestingly, the imbalance between gravity and opposing forces is only $\sim 20\%$ during core collapse, meaning that this is a quasi-equilibrium rather than a free-fall process. For most of their evolution, cores exhibit both subsonic contraction and transonic turbulence inherited from core-building flows; supersonic radial velocities accelerated by gravity only appear near the end of the collapse.

          Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds II. Properties of Critical Cores

 - **Abstract**
 A fraction of the dense cores that form within a turbulent molecular cloud will eventually collapse, leading to star formation. Identifying the physical criteria for cores to become unstable, and analyzing critical core properties, thus constitutes a necessary step toward the complete theory of star formation. To this end, here we quantify the characteristics of an ensemble of ``critical cores'' that are on the verge of collapse. This critical epoch was identified in a companion paper, which followed the dynamical evolution of prestellar cores in numerical simulations of turbulent, self-gravitating clouds. We find that radial profiles of density and turbulent velocity dispersion constructed for individual critical cores are consistent with our new model for turbulent equilibrium spheres (TESs). While there exists a global linewidth--size relation for a cloud with given size and Mach number, the turbulent scaling relations constructed around each core exhibit significant variations, locally regulating the critical density for a core to become unstable. As a result, there is no single density threshold for collapse, but instead cores collapse at a wide range of densities determined by the local sonic scale, modulated by the local gravitational potential environment, with a distribution expected for TESs with a limited range of turbulent velocity dispersion. The critical cores found in our simulations are mostly transonic; we do not find either purely thermal or highly turbulent cores. We find that the core mass function (CMF) of critical cores peaks around the characteristic mass scale associated with the average properties of a turbulent cloud. We highlight the importance of constructing the CMF at the critical time instead of sink particle mass functions, and derive the resolution requirements to unambiguously identify the peak of the CMF.

          The Milky Way and M31 Orbital History: Did the Local Group evolve in isolation?

 - **Abstract**
 We use new measurements of the M31 proper motion to examine the Milky Way (MW) - M31 orbit and angular momentum. For Local Group (LG) mass consistent with measured values, and assuming the system evolves in isolation, we show a wide range of orbits is possible. We compare to a sample of LG-like systems in the Illustris simulation and find that $\sim 13\%$ of these pairs have undergone a pericentric passage. Using the simulated sample, we examine how accurately an isolated, two-body model describes the MW-M31 orbit, and show that $\sim 10\%$ of the analogues in the simulation are well-modeled by such an orbit. Systems that evolve in isolation by this definition are found to have a lower rate of major mergers and, in particular, have no major mergers since $z \approx 0.3$. For all systems, we find an increase in the orbital angular momentum, which is fairly independent of the merger rate and is possibly explained by the influence of tidal torques on the LG. Given the likely quiet recent major merger history of the MW, it is plausible that the isolated two-body model appropriately describes the orbit, though recent evidence for a major merger in M31 may complicate this interpretation.

          Chemical Fingerprints of M Dwarfs: High-Resolution Spectroscopy on 31 M Dwarfs with SPIRou

 - **Abstract**
 We extend the methodology introduced by Jahandar et al. (2024) to determine the effective temperature and chemical abundances of 31 slowly-rotating solar neighborhood M dwarfs (M1-M5) using high-resolution spectra from CFHT/SPIRou. This group includes 10 M dwarfs in binary systems with FGK primaries of known metallicity from optical measurements. By testing our $T_{\rm eff}$ method on various synthetic models, we find a consistent inherent synthetic uncertainty of $\sim$10 K at a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 100. Additionally, we find that our results align with interferometric measurements, showing a consistent residual of $-$29 $\pm$ 31 K. Taking the inherent uncertainties into account, we infer the $T_{\rm eff}$ values of our targets and find an excellent agreement with previous optical and NIR studies. Our high-resolution chemical analysis examines hundreds of absorption lines using $\chi^2$ minimization using PHOENIX-ACES stellar atmosphere models. We present elemental abundances for up to 10 different elements, including refractory elements such as Si, Mg, and Fe, which are important for modelling the interior structure of exoplanets. In binary systems, we find an average [Fe/H] of $-$0.15 $\pm$ 0.08 for M dwarfs, marginally lower than the reported metallicity of $-$0.06 $\pm$ 0.18 for the FGK primaries from Mann et al. (2013a). We also observe slightly sub-solar chemistry for various elements in our non-binary M dwarfs, most notably for O, C, and K abundances. In particular, we find an average metallicity of $-$0.11 $\pm$ 0.16 lower but still consistent with the typical solar metallicity of FGK stars (e.g. [Fe/H] = 0.04 $\pm$ 0.20 from Brewer et al. 2016). This study highlights significant discrepancies in various major M dwarf surveys likely related to differences in the methodologies employed.

 - **Abstract**
 DDO68 is a star-forming (SF) dwarf galaxy residing in a nearby void. Its gas metallicity is among the lowest known in the local Universe, with parameter 12+log(O/H) in the range of 6.96-7.3 dex. Six of its SF regions are located in or near the so-called 'Northern Ring', in which the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images reveal many luminous young stars. We present for these SF regions (Knots) the results of optical monitoring in 35 epochs during the years 2016--2023. The data was acquired with the 6m (BTA) and the 1m telescopes of the Special Astrophysical Observatory and the 2.5m telescope of the MSU Caucasian Mountain Observatory. We complement the above results with the archive data from 10 other telescopes for 11 epochs during the years 1988-2013 and with 3 our BTA observations between 2005 and 2015. Our goal is to search for variability of these Knots and to relate it to the probable light variations of their brightest stars. One of them, DDO68-V1 (in Knot 3), was identified in 2008 with a luminous blue variable (LBV) star, born in the lowest metallicity environments. For Knot 3, variations of its integrated light in the previous epochs reached ~0.8 mag. In the period since 2016, the amplitude of variations of Knot 3 reached ~0.3 mag. For the rest Knots, due to the lower amplitudes, the manifestation of variability is less pronounced. We examine the presence of variability via the criterion chi^{2} and the Robust Median Statistics and discuss the robustness of the detected variations. The variability is detected according to the both criteria in the lightcurves of all Knots with the chi^{2} confidence level of alpha = 0.0005. The peak-to-peak amplitudes of variations are ~0.09, ~0.13, ~0.11, ~0.08 and ~0.16 mag for Knots 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, respectively. The amplitudes of the related variations of the brightest supergiants in these regions can reach of ~3.0 mag.

 We present 5-1x10^7 Angstrom spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for twelve M dwarf stars covering spectral types M0-M8. Our SEDs are provided for community use as a sequel to the Measurements of the Ultraviolet Spectral Characteristics of Low-mass Exoplanetary Systems (MUSCLES) survey. The twelve stars include eight known exoplanet hosts and four stars chosen to fill out key parameter space in spectral type and rotation period. The SEDs are constructed from Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet spectroscopy and XMM Newton, Chandra and/or Swift X-ray observations and completed with various model data, including Lyman alpha reconstructions, PHOENIX optical models, APEC coronal models and Differential Emission Measure models in the currently-unobservable Extreme Ultraviolet. We provide a complete overview of the Mega-MUSCLES program, including a description of the observations, models, and SED construction. The SEDs are available as MAST High-Level Science Products and we describe the various data products here. We also present ensemble measurements from our sample that are of particular relevance to exoplanet science, including the high-energy fluxes in the habitable zone and the FUV/NUV ratio. Combined with MUSCLES, Mega-MUSCLES provides SEDs covering a wide range of M\,dwarf spectral types and ages such that suitable proxies for any M dwarf planet host of interest may be found in our sample. However, we find that ultraviolet and X-ray fluxes can vary even between stars with similar parameters, such that observations of each exoplanet host star will remain the gold standard for interpreting exoplanet atmosphere observations.

          Primordial Black Hole Reformation in the Early Universe

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBH) can arise in a wide range of scenarios, from inflation to first-order phase transitions. Light PBHs, such as those produced during preheating or at the GUT scale, could induce an early matter-dominated phase given a moderate initial abundance. During the early matter-domination, the growth of initial PBH density perturbations can trigger collapse on horizon scales, producing much heavier PBHs. While the remaining original PBHs evaporate and reheat the Universe, these massive reformed PBHs survive for an extended period of time, producing potentially observable signatures at the present. We study this PBH reformation scenario and show that those reformed PBHs can emit significant quantities of gamma rays detectable by the next generation of experiments. The rapid reheating after matter domination generates a coincident stochastic gravitational wave background, which could be within range of the upcoming CMB-S4 experiment. The PBH reformation scenario provides an intriguing possibility of decoupling the current PBH population and the initial formation mechanism from early Universe physics, while providing opportunities for observation through multi-messenger astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on radio follow-up observations of the nearby Type II supernova, SN 2023ixf, spanning from 1.7 to 269.9 days after the explosion, conducted using three very long baseline interferometers (VLBIs), which are the Japanese VLBI Network (JVN), the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA), and the Korean VLBI Network (KVN). In three observation epochs (152.3, 206.1, and 269.9 days), we detected emission at the 6.9 and 8.4 GHz bands, with a flux density of $\sim 5$ mJy. The flux density reached a peak at around 206.1 days, which is longer than the timescale to reach the peak observed in typical Type II supernovae. Based on the analytical model of radio emission, our late-time detections were inferred to be due to the decreasing optical depth. In this case, the mass-loss rate of the progenitor is estimated to have increased from $\sim 10^{-6} - 10^{-5}\, M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ to $\sim 10^{-4}\, M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ between 28 and 6 years before the explosion. Our radio constraints are also consistent with the mass-loss rate to produce a confined circumstellar medium proposed by previous studies, which suggest that the mass-loss rate increased from $\sim 10^{-4}\, M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ to $\gtrsim 10^{-2}\, M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ in the last few years before the explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 While there are over a dozen known neutron star (NS) symbiotic X-ray binaries (SyXBs) in the Galaxy, none SyXBs containing a black hole (BH) have been detected. We address this problem by incorporating binary population synthesis and the accretion properties of BHs fed by the wind from red giant companions. We investigate the impact of different supernova mechanisms, kick velocity distributions and wind velocities on the formation of both NS and BH SyXBs. Our simulations show that the number of BH SyXBs is at most one-sixth that of NS SyXBs in the Galaxy provided that the common envelope efficiency parameter $\alpha\sim 0.3-5$. And less than $\sim 10$ of BH SyXBs could be detectable in X-ray, considering their low radiation efficiencies. These findings indicate a scarcity of BH SyXBs in the Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the formation of primordial black hole (PBH) based on numerical relativity simulations and peak theory as well as the corresponding scalar induced gravitational wave (SIGW) signals in the presence of \emph{logarithmic non-Gaussianities} which has recently been confirmed in a wide class of inflation models. Through numerical calculations, we find certain parameter spaces of the critical thresholds for the type A PBH formation and reveal a maximum critical threshold value. We also find that there is a region where no PBH is produced from type II fluctuations contrary to a previous study. We then confirm that SIGW signals originated from the logarithmic non-Gaussianity are detectable in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna if PBHs account for whole dark matter. Finally, we discuss the SIGW interpretation of the nHz stochastic gravitational wave background reported by the recent pulsar timing array observations. We find that PBH overproduction is a serious problem for most of the parameter space, while this tension might still be alleviated in the non-perturbative regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Binarity plays a crucial role in star formation and evolution. Consequently, identifying binary stars is essential to deepen our understanding of these processes. We propose a method to investigate the observed radial velocity distribution of massive stars in young clusters with the goal of identifying binary systems. We reconstruct the radial velocity distribution using a three-layers hierarchical Bayesian non-parametric approach: non-parametric methods are data-driven models able to infer arbitrary probability densities under minimal mathematical assumptions. When applying our statistical framework, it is possible to identify variable stars and binary systems because these deviate significantly from the expected intrinsic Gaussian distribution for radial velocities. We test our method with the massive star forming region within the giant H$_\mathrm{II}$ region M17. We are able to confidently identify binaries and variable stars with as little as single-epoch observations. The distinction between variable and binary stars improves significantly when introducing additional epochs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present deep JWST/NIRSpec integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) and ALMA [CII]$\lambda$158$\mu$m observations of COS-3018, a star-forming galaxy at z$\sim$6.85, as part of the GA-NIFS programme. Both G395H (R$\sim$ 2700) and PRISM (R$\sim$ 100) NIRSpec observations revealed that COS-3018 is comprised of three separate components detected in [OIII]$\lambda$5008, which we dub as Main, North and East, with stellar masses of 10$^{9.4 \pm 0.1}$, 10$^{9.2 \pm 0.07}$, 10$^{7.7 \pm 0.15}$ M$_{\odot}$. We detect [OIII]$\lambda$5008, [OIII]$\lambda\lambda$3727,29 and multiple Balmer lines in all three components together with [OIII]$\lambda$4363 in the Main and North components. This allows us to measure an ISM temperature of T$_{e}$= 1.27$\pm0.07\times 10^4$ and T$_{e}$= 1.6$\pm0.14\times 10^4$ K with densities of $n_{e}$ = 1250$\pm$250 and $n_{e}$ = 700$\pm$200 cm$^{-3}$, respectively. These deep observations allow us to measure an average metallicity of 12+log(O/H)=7.9--8.2 for the three components with the T$_{e}$-method. We do not find any significant evidence of metallicity gradients between the components. Furthermore, we also detect [NII]$\lambda$6585, one of the highest redshift detections of this emission line. We find that in a small, metal-poor clump 0.2 arcsec west of the North component, N/O is elevated compared to other regions, indicating that nitrogen enrichment originates from smaller substructures, possibly proto-globular clusters. [OIII]$\lambda$5008 kinematics show that this system is merging, which is probably driving the ongoing, luminous starburst.

 - **Abstract**
 The standard cosmological model is sufficiently well constrained that precise estimates can be provided for the redshift of various physically defined times in the chronology of the Universe. For example, it is well known that matter-radiation equality, recombination and reionisation happen at redshifts of around 3000, 1000 and 10, respectively, and these can be specified more precisely by fitting to data. What is less well known are the times in years (and their uncertainties) for these and other epochs in the history of the Universe. Here we provide precise time determinations for six epochs in cosmological history within the standard model, using data from the Planck satellite. Our main results are illustrated in a figure.

          Modelling the Center-to-Limb systematic in normal-mode-coupling measurements

 - **Abstract**
 Solar meridional circulation, which manifests as poleward flow near the surface, is a relatively weak flow. While meridional circulation has been measured through various local helioseismic techniques, there is a lack of consensus about the nature of the depth profile and location of return flow, owing to its small amplitude and poor signal-to-noise ratio in observations. The measurements are strongly hampered by systematic effects, whose amplitudes are comparable to the signal induced by the flow and modelling them is therefore crucial. The removal of the center-to-limb systematic, which is the largest known feature hampering the inference of meridional flow, has been heuristically performed in helioseismic analyses, but it's effect on global modes is not fully understood or modelled. Here, we propose both a way to model the center-to-limb systematic and a method for estimation of meridional flow using global helioseismic cross-spectral analysis. We demonstrate that the systematic cannot be ignored while modelling the mode-coupling cross-spectral measurement and thus is critical for the inference of meridional circulation. We also show that inclusion of a model for the center-to-limb systematic improves shallow meridional circulation estimates from cross-spectral analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we explore the detectability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) under diverse planetary conditions, aiming to identify promising targets for future observations of planetary atmospheres. Our primary goal is to determine the minimum detectable mass fractions of PAHs on each studied planet. We integrate the one-dimensional self consistent model petitCODE with petitRADTRANS, a radiative transfer model, to simulate the transmission spectra of these planets. Subsequently, we employ the PandExo noise simulator using the NIRSpec PRISM instrument aboard the JWST to assess the observability. Then, we conduct a Bayesian analysis through the MULTINEST code. Our findings illustrate that variations in C/O ratios and planet temperatures significantly influence the transmission spectra and the detectability of PAHs. Our results show that planets with [Fe/H]=0 and 1, C/O=0.55, and temperatures around 1200 K are the most promising for detecting PAHs, with detectable mass fractions as low as 10$^{-7}$, or one thousandth of the ISM abundance level. For colder planets with lower metallicities and C/O ratios, as well as hotter planets with carbon-rich atmospheres, PAHs can be detected at abundances around 10$^{-6}$. These results aid our strategy for selecting targets to study PAHs in the atmospheres of exoplanets.

 Following the discovery of several ocean worlds in the solar system, and the selection of Uranus as the highest priority objective by the Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032, the five largest moons of Uranus (Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon) have been receiving renewed attention as they may also harbor a subsurface ocean. We assess how rotation measurements could help confirm the internal differentiation of the bodies and detect internal oceans if any. Because of the time-varying gravitational torque of Uranus on the flattened shape of its synchronous satellites, the latter librate with respect to their mean rotation and precess with a non zero obliquity. For a range of interior models with a rocky core surrounded by a hydrosphere, either solid or divided into an outer ice shell with a liquid ocean underneath, we compute their diurnal libration amplitude and obliquity.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot Jupiters with close-by planetary companions are rare, with only a handful of them having been discovered so far. This could be due to their suggested dynamical histories, leading to the possible ejection of other planets. TOI-2109 b is special in this regard because it is the hot Jupiter with the closest relative separation from its host star, being separated by less than 2.3 stellar radii. Unexpectedly, transit timing measurements from recently obtained CHEOPS observations show low amplitude transit-timing variations (TTVs). We aim to search for signs of orbital decay and to characterise the apparent TTVs, trying to gain information about a possible companion. We fit the newly obtained CHEOPS light curves using TLCM and extract the resulting mid-transit timings. Successively, we use these measurements in combination with TESS and archival photometric data and radial velocity data to estimate the rate of tidal orbital decay of TOI-2109 b, as well as characterise the TTVs using the N-body code TRADES and the photodynamical approach of PyTTV. We find tentative evidence at $3\sigma$ for orbital decay in the TOI-2109 system, when we correct the mid-transit timings using the best-fitting sinusoidal model of the TTVs. We do not detect additional transits in the available photometric data, but find evidence towards the authenticity of the apparent TTVs, indicating a close-by, outer companion with $P_\mathrm{c} > 1.125\,$d. Due to the fast rotation of the star, the new planetary candidate cannot be detected in the available radial velocity (RV) measurements, and its parameters can only be loosely constrained by our joint TTV and RV modelling. TOI-2109 could join a small group of rare hot Jupiter systems that host close-by planetary companions, only one of which (WASP-47 b) has an outer companion. More high-precision photometric measurements are necessary to confirm the planetary companion.

 - **Abstract**
 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been detected throughout the universe where they play essential roles in the evolution of their environments. For example, they are believed to affect atmospheric loss rates of close-in planets and might contribute to the pre-biotic chemistry and emergence of life. Despite their importance, the study of PAHs in exoplanet atmospheres has been limited. We aim to evaluate the possibility of detecting PAHs on exoplanets considering future observations using JWST's NIRSpec PRISM mode. The hot Saturn WASP-6 b shows properties that are consistent with a potential PAH presence and is thus used as a case study for this work. Here, we compare the likelihoods of various synthetic haze species and their combinations with the influence of PAHs on the transmission spectrum of WASP-6 b. This is possible by applying the atmospheric retrieval code petitRADTRANS to a collection of data from previous observations. Subsequently, by exploring synthetic, single transit JWST spectra of this planet that include PAHs, we assess if these molecules can be detected in the near future. Previous observations support the presence of cloud/haze species in the spectrum of WASP-6 b. While this may include PAHs, the current data do not confirm their existence unambiguously. Our research suggests that utilizing the JWST for future observations could lead to a notable advancement in the study of PAHs. Employing this telescope, we find that a PAH abundance of approximately 0.1 per cent of the ISM value could be robustly detectable.

 - **Abstract**
 The image of a Kerr-Newman (KN) black hole (BH) surrounded by a thin accretion disk is derived. By employing elliptic integrals and ray-tracing methods, we analyze photon trajectories around the KN BH. At low observation inclination angles, the secondary image of particles is embedded within the primary image. However, as the inclination increases, the primary and secondary images separate, forming a hat-like structure. The spin and charge of the BH, along with the observer's inclination angle, affect the image's asymmetry and the distortion of the inner shadow. To investigate the redshift distribution on the accretion disk, we extended the inner boundary of the accretion disk to the event horizon. The results show that the redshift distribution is significantly influenced by the observation inclination angle. Furthermore, we conducted a detailed analysis of the KN BH image using fisheye camera ray-tracing techniques and found that the optical appearance and intensity distribution of the BH vary at different observation frequencies (specifically at 230GHz and 86GHz). We also examined differences in intensity distribution for prograde and retrograde accretion disk scenarios. Comparing observational at the two frequencies, we found that both the total intensity and peak intensity at 86GHz are higher than those at 230GHz.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the external reverse shock region of relativistic jets as the origin of X-ray afterglows of jetted tidal disruption events (TDEs) that exhibit luminous jets accompanied by fast-declining non-thermal X-ray emissions. We model the dynamics of jet propagating within an external density medium, accounting for continuous energy injection driven by accretion activities. We compute the time-dependent synchrotron and inverse Compton emissions from the reverse shock region. Our analysis demonstrates that the reverse shock scenario can potentially explain the X-ray light curves and spectra of four jetted TDEs, AT 2022cmc, Swift J1644, Swift J2058, and Swift J1112. Notably, the rapid steepening of the late-stage X-ray light curves can be attributed jointly to the jet break and cessation of the central engine as the accretion rate drops below the Eddington limit. Using parameters obtained from X-ray data fitting, we also discuss the prospects for $\gamma$-ray and neutrino detection.

 - **Abstract**
 We identify a point-symmetrical morphology comprised of seven pairs of opposite bays in the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant Crab Nebula, which is consistent with the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe. We use a recently published infrared image of the Crab Nebula and apply image analysis to fit seven pairs of bays in the Crab, each pair of two bays and a symmetry axis connecting them. The seven symmetry axes intersect close to the explosion site, forming a point-symmetrical structure. We explain the bays as clumps that move slower than the low-density ejecta that the pulsar accelerated. Jittering jets that exploded the Crab formed the clumps during the explosion process. This shows that jittering jets explode even very low-energy CCSNe, as the Crab is, adding to the solidification of the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.

 - **Abstract**
 To date there is little publicly available scientific data on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) whose properties and kinematics purportedly reside outside the performance envelope of known phenomena. To address this deficiency, the Galileo Project is designing, building, and commissioning a multi-modal ground-based observatory to continuously monitor the sky and conduct a rigorous long-term aerial census of all aerial phenomena, including natural and human-made. One of the key instruments is an all-sky infrared camera array using eight uncooled long-wave infrared FLIR Boson 640 cameras. Their calibration includes a novel extrinsic calibration method using airplane positions from Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. We establish a first baseline for the system performance over five months of field operation, using a real-world dataset derived from ADS-B data, synthetic 3-D trajectories, and a hand-labelled real-world dataset. We report acceptance rates (e.g. viewable airplanes that are recorded) and detection efficiencies (e.g. recorded airplanes which are successfully detected) for a variety of weather conditions, range and aircraft size. We reconstruct $\sim$500,000 trajectories of aerial objects from this commissioning period. A toy outlier search focused on large sinuosity of the 2-D reconstructed trajectories flags about 16% of trajectories as outliers. After manual review, 144 trajectories remain ambiguous: they are likely mundane objects but cannot be elucidated at this stage of development without distance and kinematics estimation or other sensor modalities. Our observed count of ambiguous outliers combined with systematic uncertainties yields an upper limit of 18,271 outliers count for the five-month interval at a 95% confidence level. This likelihood-based method to evaluate significance is applicable to all of our future outlier searches.

 - **Abstract**
 In the past few years, the improved sensitivity and cadence of wide-field optical surveys have enabled the discovery of several afterglows without associated detected gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We present the identification, observations, and multiwavelength modeling of a recent such afterglow (AT2023lcr), and model three literature events (AT2020blt, AT2021any, and AT2021lfa) in a consistent fashion. For each event, we consider the following possibilities as to why a GRB was not observed: 1) the jet was off-axis; 2) the jet had a low initial Lorentz factor; and 3) the afterglow was the result of an on-axis classical GRB (on-axis jet with physical parameters typical of the GRB population), but the emission was undetected by gamma-ray satellites. We estimate all physical parameters using afterglowpy and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods from emcee. We find that AT2023lcr, AT2020blt, and AT2021any are consistent with on-axis classical GRBs, and AT2021lfa is consistent with both on-axis low Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_0 \approx 5 - 13$) and off-axis ($\theta_\text{obs}=2\theta_\text{jet}$) high Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_0 \approx 100$) jets.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we employ the Palatini formalism to investigate the dynamics of large-field inflation using a renormalizable polynomial inflaton potential in the context of $f(R,\phi)$ gravity. Assuming instant reheating, we make a comparative analysis of large-field polynomial inflation (PI). We first consider the minimal and non-minimal coupling of inflaton in $R$ gravity, and then we continue with the minimally and non-minimally coupled inflaton in $f(R,\phi)$ gravity. We scan the parameter space for the inflationary predictions ($n_s$ and $r$) consistent with the Planck and BICEP/Keck 2018 results as well as the sensitivity forecast of the future CMB-S4 and depict the compliant regions in the $\phi_0-\beta$ plane where $\phi_0$ and $\beta$ are two parameters of polynomial inflation model which control the saddle point of the potential and the flatness in the vicinity of this point respectively. We find that a substantial portion of the parameter space aligns with the observational data.
