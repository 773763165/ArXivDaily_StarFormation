          The long freeze: an asymptotically static universe from holographic dark energy

 - **Abstract**
 We show that some holographic dark energy models can lead to a future evolution of the universe in which the scale factor $a$ is asymptotically constant, while $\dot a \rightarrow 0$ and the corresponding energy and pressure densities also vanish. We provide specific examples of such models and general conditions that can lead to an asymptotically static universe, which we have called the ``long freeze." We show that in some cases, such evolution can follow an arbitrarily long exponential expansion essentially identical to the asymptotic evolution of $\Lambda$CDM.

 - **Abstract**
 Autonomous precision navigation to land onto the Moon relies on vision sensors. Computer vision algorithms are designed, trained and tested using synthetic simulations. High quality terrain models have been produced by Moon orbiters developed by several nations, with resolutions ranging from tens or hundreds of meters globally down to few meters locally. The SurRender software is a powerful simulator able to exploit the full potential of these datasets in raytracing. New interfaces include tools to fuse multi-resolution DEMs and procedural texture generation. A global model of the Moon at 20m resolution was integrated representing several terabytes of data which SurRender can render continuously and in real-time. This simulator will be a precious asset for the development of future missions.

          The Puppis A supernova remnant: an early jet-driven neutron star kick followed by jittering jets

 - **Abstract**
 We identify a point-symmetric morphology of three pairs of ears/clumps in the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (CCSNR) Puppis A, supporting the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). In the JJEM, the three pairs of jets that shaped the three pairs of ears/clumps in Puppis A are part of a large, about 10 to 30 pairs of jets that exploded Puppis A. Some similarities in morphological features between CCSNR Puppis A and three multipolar planetary nebulae considered to have been shaped by jets solidify the claim for shaping by jets. Puppis A has a prominent dipole structure, where one side is bright with a well-defined boundary, while the other is faint and defused. The neutron star (NS) remnant of Puppis A has a proper velocity, its natal kick velocity, in the opposite direction to the denser part of the dipole structure. We propose a new mechanism in the frame of the JJEM that imparts a natal kick to the NS, the kick-by-early asymmetrical pair (kick-BEAP) mechanism. At the early phase of the explosion process, the NS launches a pair of jets where one jet is much more energetic than the counter jet. The more energetic jet compresses a dense side to the CCSNR, and, by momentum conservation, the NS recoils in the opposite direction. Our study supports the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe and enriches this explosion mechanism by introducing the novel kick-BEAP mechanism.
#### Title:
          The VIRUS-dE Survey II: Cuspy and round halos in dwarf ellipticals -- A result of early assembly?

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the dark matter (DM) halos of a sample of dwarf Ellitpicals (dE) and discuss cosmological and evolutionary implications. Using orbit modeling we recover their density slopes and, for the first time, the halo flattening. We find the `cusp-core' tension is mild, on average dEs have central slopes slightly below the Navarro Frenk White (NFW) predictions. However, the measured flattenings are still more spherical than cosmological simulations predict. Unlike brighter ETGs the total density slopes of dEs are shallower, and their average DM density does not follow their scaling relation with luminosity. Conversely, dE halos are denser and the densities steeper than in LTGs. We find average DM density and slope are strongly correlated with the environment and moderately with the angular momentum. Central, non-rotating dEs have dense and cuspy halos, whereas rotating dEs in Virgo's outskirts are more cored and less dense. This can be explained by a delayed formation of the dEs in the cluster outskirts, or alternatively, by the accumulated baryonic feedback the dEs in the outskirts have experienced during their very different star formation history. Our results suggest halo profiles are not universal (they depend on assembly conditions) and they evolve only mildly due to internal feedback. We conclude dEs in the local Universe have assembled at a higher redshift than local spirals. In these extreme conditions (e.g. star-formation, halo assembly) were very different, suggesting no new dEs are formed at present.

          Thermal Evolution of Lava Planets

 - **Abstract**
 Rocky planets are thought to form with a magma ocean that quickly solidifies. The horizontal and vertical extent of this magma ocean depends on the interior thermal evolution of the planet, and possibly exogenous processes such as planet migration. We present a model for simulating the thermal history of tidally locked lava planets. We initiate the model with a completely molten mantle and evolve it for ten billion years. We adopt a fixed surface temperature of 3000 K for the irradiated day-side, but allow the night-side temperature to evolve along with the underlying layers. We simulate planets of radius 1.0$R_{\oplus}$ and 1.5$R_{\oplus}$ with different core mass fractions, although the latter does not significantly impact the thermal evolution. We confirm that the day-side magma ocean on these planets has a depth that depends on the planetary radius. The night-side, on the other hand, begins crystallizing within a few thousand years and completely solidifies within 800 million years in the absence of substantial tidal heating or day-night heat transport. We show that a magma ocean can be sustained on the night-side of a lava planet if at least 20 per cent of absorbed stellar power is transmitted from the day-side to the night-side via magma currents. Such day-night transport could be sustained if the magma has a viscosity of $10^{-3}$ Pa s, which is plausible at these temperatures. Alternatively, the night-side could remain molten if the mush layer is tidally heated at the rate of $8 \times 10^{-4}$ W/kg of mush, which is plausible for orbital eccentricities of $e > 7 \times 10^{-3}$. Night-side cooling is a runaway process, however: the magma becomes more viscous and the mush solidifies, reducing both day-night heat transport and tidal heating. Measurements of the night-sides of lava planets are therefore a sensitive probe of the thermal history of these planets.

          Accurate simulations of reionization using the reduced speed of light approximation

 - **Abstract**
 The reduced speed of light approximation has been employed to speed up radiative transfer simulations of reionization by a factor of $\gtrsim 5-10$. However, it has been shown to cause significant errors in the HI-ionizing background near reionization's end in simulations of representative cosmological volumes. This can bias inferences on the galaxy ionizing emissivity required to match observables, such as the Ly$\alpha$ forest. In this work, we show that using a reduced speed of light is, to a good approximation, equivalent to re-scaling the global ionizing emissivity in a redshift-dependent way. We derive this re-scaling and show that it can be used to ``correct'' the emissivity in reduced speed of light simulations. This approach of re-scaling the emissivity after the simulation has been run is useful in contexts where the emissivity is a free parameter. We test our method by running full speed of light simulations using these re-scaled emissivities and comparing them with their reduced speed of light counterparts. We find that for reduced speeds of light $\tilde{c} \geq 0.2$, the 21 cm power spectrum at $0.1 \leq k /[h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}] \leq 0.2$ and key Ly$\alpha$ forest observables agree to within $20\%$ throughout reionization, and often better than $10\%$. Position-dependent time-delay effects cause inaccuracies in reionization's morphology on large scales that produce errors up to a factor of $2$ for $\tilde{c} \leq 0.1$. Our method enables a factor of $5$ speedup of radiative transfer simulations of reionization in situations where the emissivity can be treated as a free parameter.

          Improved Halo Model Calibrations for Mixed Dark Matter Models of Ultralight Axions
 - **Authors:** Tibor Dome, Simon May, Alex Laguë, David J. E. Marsh, Sarah Johnston, Sownak Bose, Alex Tocher, Anastasia Fialkov

 - **Abstract**
 We study the implications of relaxing the requirement for ultralight axions to account for all dark matter in the Universe by examining mixed dark matter (MDM) cosmologies with axion fractions $f \leq 0.3$ within the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) window $10^{-25}$ eV $\lesssim m \lesssim 10^{-23}$ eV. Our simulations, using a new MDM gravity solver implemented in AxiREPO, capture wave dynamics across various scales with high accuracy down to redshifts $z\approx 1$. We identify halos with Rockstar using the CDM component and find good agreement of inferred halo mass functions (HMFs) and concentration-mass relations with theoretical models across redshifts $z=1-10$. This justifies our halo finder approach a posteriori as well as the assumptions underlying the MDM halo model AxionHMcode. Using the inferred axion halo mass - cold halo mass relation $M_{\text{a}}(M_{\text{c}})$ and calibrating a generalised smoothing parameter $\alpha$ to our MDM simulations, we present a new version of AxionHMcode. The code exhibits excellent agreement with simulations on scales $k< 20 \ h$ cMpc$^{-1}$ at redshifts $z=1-3.5$ for $f\leq 0.1$ around the fiducial axion mass $m = 10^{-24.5}$ eV $ = 3.16\times 10^{-25}$ eV, with maximum deviations remaining below 10%. For axion fractions $f\leq 0.3$, the model maintains accuracy with deviations under 20% at redshifts $z\approx 1$ and scales $k< 10 \ h$ cMpc$^{-1}$, though deviations can reach up to 30% for higher redshifts when $f=0.3$. Reducing the run-time for a single evaluation of AxionHMcode to below $1$ minute, these results highlight the potential of AxionHMcode to provide a robust framework for parameter sampling across MDM cosmologies in Bayesian constraint and forecast analyses.

          Adaptive particle refinement for compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce adaptive particle refinement for compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). SPH calculations have the natural advantage that resolution follows mass, but this is not always optimal. Our implementation allows the user to specify local regions of the simulation that can be more highly resolved. We test our implementation on practical applications including a circumbinary disc, a planet embedded in a disc and a flyby. By comparing with equivalent globally high resolution calculations we show that our method is accurate and fast, with errors in the mass accreted onto sinks of less than 9 percent and speed ups of 1.07-6.62 times for the examples shown. Our method is adaptable and easily extendable, for example with multiple refinement regions or derefinement.

 - **Abstract**
 The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) Project has a new VLBI Outrigger at the Green Bank Observatory (GBO), which forms a 3300km baseline with CHIME operating at 400-800MHz. Using 100ms long full-array baseband "snapshots" collected commensally during FRB and pulsar triggers, we perform a shallow, wide-area VLBI survey covering a significant fraction of the Northern sky targeted at the positions of compact sources from the Radio Fundamental Catalog. In addition, our survey contains calibrators detected from two 1s long trial baseband snapshots for a deeper survey with CHIME and GBO. In this paper, we present the largest catalog of compact calibrators suitable for 30-milliarcsecond-scale VLBI observations at sub-GHz frequencies to date. Our catalog consists of 200 total calibrators in the Northern Hemisphere that are compact on 30-milliarcsecond scales with fluxes above 100mJy. This calibrator grid will enable the precise localization of hundreds of FRBs a year with CHIME/FRB-Outriggers.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. The goal of this work is to comprehensively characterize the impact of stellar multiplicity on Class II disks in the L1641 and L1647 regions of Orion A (~1-3 Myr), part of the Survey of Orion Disks with ALMA (SODA). We characterize the protostellar multiplicity using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the ESO-VISTA, and Hubble Space telescopes. The resulting sample of 65 multiple systems represents the largest catalogue of wide binary systems to date (projected separation >1000 AU), allowing a more robust statistical characterization of the evolution and properties of protoplanetary disks. Methods. The disk population was observed in continuum with ALMA at 225 GHz, with a median rms of 1.5 Mearth. Combining these data (resolution ~1.1arcsec ) with the ESO-VISTA near-infrared survey of the Orion A cloud (resolution ~0.7arcsec ), multiple systems are assembled and selected by an iterative inside-out search in projected separation (>1000 AU). Results. We identify 61 binary systems, 3 triple systems, and one quadruple system. The separation range is between 1000 and 10^4 AU. The dust mass distributions inferred with the Kaplan-Meier estimator yield a median mass of 3.23+0.6-0.4 Mearth for primary disks and 3.88+0.3-0.3 Mearth for secondary disks.

          Instability and warping in vertically oscillating accretion discs

 - **Abstract**
 Many accretion discs have been found to be distorted: either warped due a misalignment in the system, or non-circular as a result of orbital eccentricity or tidal deformation by a binary companion. Warped, eccentric, and tidally distorted discs are not in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium, and thus exhibit vertical oscillations in the direction perpendicular to the disc, a phenomenon that is absent in circular and flat discs. In extreme cases, this vertical motion is manifested as a vertical `bouncing' of the gas, potentially leading to shocks and heating, as observed in recent global numerical simulations. In this paper we isolate the mechanics of vertical disc oscillations by means of quasi-2D and fully 3D hydrodynamic local (shearing-box) models. To determine the numerical and physical dissipation mechanisms at work during an oscillation we start by investigating unforced oscillations, examining the effect of initial oscillation amplitude, as well as resolution, boundary conditions, and vertical box size on the dissipation and energetics of the oscillations. We then drive the oscillations by introducing a time-dependent gravitational potential. A key result is that even a purely vertically oscillating disc is (parametrically) unstable to developing inertial waves, as we confirm through a linear stability analysis. The most important of these has the character of a bending wave, whose radial wavelength depends on the frequency of the vertical oscillation. The nonlinear phase of the instability exhibits shocks, which dampen the oscillations, although energy can also flow from the bending wave back to the vertical oscillation.

 - **Abstract**
 orbitize! is a package for Bayesian modeling of the orbital parameters of resolved binary objects from time series measurements. It was developed with the needs of the high-contrast imaging community in mind, and has since also become widely used in the binary star community. A generic orbitize! use case involves translating relative astrometric time series, optionally combined with radial velocity or astrometric time series, into a set of derived orbital posteriors. This paper is published alongside the release of orbitize! version 3.0, which has seen significant enhancements in functionality and accessibility since the release of version 1.0 (Blunt et al., 2020).

          The Black Hole Mass and Photometric Components of NGC 4826

 - **Abstract**
 We present IR photometry and HST imaging and spectroscopy of Sab galaxy NGC 4826. Schwarzschild dynamical modeling is used to measure its central black hole mass $M$. Photometric decomposition is used to enable a comparison of $M$ to published scaling relations between black hole masses and properties of host bulges. This decomposition implies that NGC 4826 contains classical and pseudo bulges of approximately equal mass. The classical bulge has best-fit Sérsic index $n=3.27$. The pseudobulge is made up of three parts, an inner lens ($n=0.18$ at $r\lesssim4^{\prime\prime}$), an outer lens ($n=0.17$ at $r \lesssim 45^{\prime\prime}$), and a $n=0.58$ component required to match the surface brightness between the lens components. The total $V$-band luminosity of the galaxy is $M_{VT}=-21.07$, the ratio of classical bulge to total light is $B/T\simeq0.12$, and the ratio of pseudobulge to total light is $PB/T\simeq0.13$. The outer disk is exponential ($n=1.07$) and makes up $D/T=0.75$ of the light of the galaxy. Our best-fit Schwarzschild model has a black hole mass with $1\sigma$ uncertainties of $M=8.4^{+1.7}_{-0.6}\times10^6\ M_\odot$ and a stellar $K$-band mass-to-light ratio of $\Upsilon_K=0.46\pm0.03\ M_{\odot}\ \mathrm{L}_{\odot}^{-1}$ at the assumed distance of 7.27 Mpc. Our modeling is marginally consistent with $M=0$ at the $3\sigma$ limit. These best-fit parameters were calculated assuming the black hole is located where the velocity dispersion is largest; this is offset from the maximum surface brightness, probably because of dust absorption. The black hole mass -- one of the smallest measured by modeling stellar dynamics -- satisfies the well known correlations of $M$ with the $K$-band luminosity, stellar mass, and velocity dispersion of the classical bulge only in contrast to total (classical plus pseudo) bulge luminosity.

          Gravity or turbulence? VII. The Schmidt-Kennicutt law, the star formation efficiency, and the mass density of clusters from gravitational collapse rather than turbulent support

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the Schmidt-Kennicutt (SK) relations and the star formation efficiency per free-fall time ($\eff$), mirroring observational studies, in numerical simulations of filamentary molecular clouds undergoing gravitational contraction. We find that {\it a)} collapsing clouds accurately replicate the observed SK relations for galactic clouds and {\it b)} the so-called efficiency per free-fall time ($\eff$) is small and constant in space and in time, with values similar to those found in local clouds. This constancy is a consequence of the similar radial scaling of the free-fall time and the internal mass in density structures with spherically-averaged density profiles near $r^{-2}$. We additionally show that {\it c)} the star formation rate (SFR) increases rapidly in time; {\it d)} the low values of $\eff$ are due to the different time periods over which $\tauff$ and $\tausf$ are evaluated, together with the fast increasing SFR, and {\it e)} the fact that star clusters are significantly denser than the gas clumps from which they form is a natural consequence of the fast increasing SFR, the continuous replenishment of the star-forming gas by the accretion flow, and the near $r^{-2}$ density profile generated by the collapse Finally, we argue that the interpretation of $\eff$ as an efficiency is problematic because its maximum value is not bounded by unity, and because the total gas mass in the clouds is not fixed, but rather depends on the environment where clouds are embedded. In summary, our results show that the SK relation, the typical observed values of $\eff$, and the mass density of clusters arise as a natural consequence of gravitational contraction.

          Reionization relics in the cross-correlation between the Ly$\alpha$ forest and 21 cm intensity mapping in the post-reionization era

 - **Abstract**
 The tumultuous effects of ultraviolet photons that source cosmic reionization, the subsequent compression and shock-heating of low-density regions, and the modulation of baryons in shallow potential wells induced by the passage of ionization fronts, collectively introduce perturbations to the evolution of the intergalactic medium in the post-reionization era. These enduring fluctuations persist deep into the post-reionization era, casting a challenge upon precision cosmology endeavors targeting tracers in this cosmic era. Simultaneously, these relics from reionization also present a unique opportunity to glean insights into the astrophysics that govern the epoch of reionization. In this work, we propose a first study of the cross-correlation of \lya forest and 21 cm intensity mapping, accounting for the repercussions of inhomogeneous reionization in the post-reionization era. We investigate the ability of SKA $\times$ DESI-like, SKA $\times$ MUST-like, and PUMA $\times$ MUST-like instrumental setups to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the redshift range $3.5 \leq z \leq 4$. Moreover, we assess how alterations in integration time, survey area, and reionization scenarios impact the SNR. Furthermore, we forecast the cross-correlation's potential to constrain cosmological parameters under varying assumptions: considering or disregarding reionization relics, marginalizing over reionization astrophysics, and assuming perfect knowledge of reionization. Notably, our findings underscore the remarkable capability of a futuristic PUMA $\times$ MUST-like setup, with a modest 100-hour integration time over a 100 sq. deg. survey, to constrain the ionization efficiency error to $\sigma_\zeta = 3.42 $.

 - **Abstract**
 The TRAPPIST-1 system has been extensively observed with JWST in the near-infrared with the goal of measuring atmospheric transit transmission spectra of these temperate, Earth-sized exoplanets. A byproduct of these observations has been much more precise times of transit compared with prior available data from Spitzer, HST, or ground-based telescopes. In this note we use 23 new timing measurements of all seven planets in the near-infrared from five JWST observing programs to better forecast and constrain the future times of transit in this system. In particular, we note that the transit times of TRAPPIST-1h have drifted significantly from a prior published analysis by up to tens of minutes. Our newer forecast has a higher precision, with median statistical uncertainties ranging from 7-105 seconds during JWST Cycles 4 and 5. Our expectation is that this forecast will help to improve planning of future observations of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, whereas we postpone a full dynamical analysis to future work.

 - **Abstract**
 We trained denoiser autoencoding neural networks on medium resolution simulated optical spectra of late-type stars to demonstrate that the reconstruction of the original flux is possible at a typical relative error of a fraction of a percent down to a typical signal-to-noise ratio of 10 per pixel. We show that relatively simple networks are capable of learning the characteristics of stellar spectra while still flexible enough to adapt to different values of extinction and fluxing imperfections that modifies the overall shape of the continuum, as well as to different values of Doppler shift. Denoised spectra can be used to find initial values for traditional stellar template fitting algorithms and - since evaluation of pre-trained neural networks is significantly faster than traditional template fitting - denoiser networks can be useful when a fast analysis of the noisy spectrum is necessary, for example during observations, between individual exposures.

 - **Abstract**
 The understanding of the formation and evolution of the solar system still has many unanswered questions. Formation of solids in the solar system, mineral and organic mixing, and planetary body creation are all topics of interest to the community. Studying these phenomena is often performed through observations, remote sensing, and in-situ analysis, but there are limitations to the methods. Limitations such as IR diffraction limits, spatial resolution issues, and spectral resolution issues can prevent detection of organics, detection and identification of cellular structures, and the disentangling of granular mixtures. Optical-PhotoThermal InfraRed (O-PTIR) spectroscopy is a relatively new method of spectroscopy currently used in fields other than planetary sciences. O-PTIR is a non-destructive, highly repeatable, and fast form of measurement capable of reducing these limitations. Using a dual laser system with an IR source tuned to the mid-IR wavelength we performed laboratory O-PTIR measurements to compare O-PTIR data to existing IR absorption data and laboratory FTIR measurements for planetary materials. We do this for the purpose of introducing O-PTIR to the planetary science community. The technique featured here would serve to better measurements of planetary bodies during in-situ analysis. We find that, unlike other fields where O-PTIR produces almost one-to-one measurements with IR absorption measurements of the same material, granular materials relevant to planetary science do not. However, we do find that the materials compared were significantly close and O-PTIR was still capable of identifying materials relevant to planetary science.

 - **Abstract**
 Twenty-one-centimetre signals from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) are expected to be detected in the low-frequency radio window by the next-generation interferometers, particularly the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). However, precision data analysis pipelines are required to minimize the systematics within an infinitesimal error budget. Consequently, there is a growing need to characterize the sources of errors in EoR analysis. In this study, we identify one such error origin, namely source blending, which is introduced by the overlap of objects in the densely populated observing sky under SKA1-Low's unprecedented sensitivity and resolution, and evaluate its two-fold impact in both the spatial and frequency domains using a novel hybrid evaluation (HEVAL) pipeline combining end-to-end simulation with an analytic method to mimic EoR analysis pipelines. Sky models corrupted by source blending induce small but severe frequency-dependent calibration errors when coupled with astronomical foregrounds, impeding EoR parameter inference with strong additive residuals in the two-dimensional power spectrum space. We report that additive residuals from poor calibration against sky models with blending ratios of 5 and 0.5 per cent significantly contaminate the EoR window. In contrast, the sky model with a 0.05 per cent blending ratio leaves little residual imprint within the EoR window, therefore identifying a blending tolerance at approximately 0.05 per cent. Given that the SKA observing sky is estimated to suffer from an extended level of blending, strategies involving de-blending, frequency-dependent error mitigation, or a combination of both, are required to effectively attenuate the calibration impact of source-blending defects.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion disc outbursts are re-occurring events observed in various astrophysical systems, including X-ray binaries and cataclysmic variables. These outbursts are characterized by a sudden increase in luminosity due to various instabilities in the accretion disc. We need to investigate the time-dependent accretion flow models to understand the mechanisms driving these outbursts. Time-dependent models incorporate the disc's time evolution and can capture the build-up of instabilities. This review aims to give a basic overview of accretion disc outburst and stability analysis. The paper highlights the necessity of considering the hierarchy of different timescales, dynamical, viscous, and thermal, when investigating the instabilities occurring in the accretion disc. The importance and observational implications of studying these accretion disc outbursts are also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 CXOU J110926.4-650224 is a candidate transitional millisecond pulsar (tMSP) with X-ray and radio emission properties reminiscent of those observed in confirmed tMSPs in their X-ray 'subluminous' disc state. We present the results of observing campaigns that, for the first time, characterise the optical and near-infrared variability of this source and establish a connection with the mode-switching phenomenon observed in X-rays. The optical emission exhibited flickering activity, frequent dipping episodes where it appeared redder, and a multi-peaked flare where it was bluer. The variability pattern was strongly correlated with that of the X-ray emission. Each dip matched an X-ray low-mode episode, indicating that a significant portion of the optical emission originates from nearly the same region as the X-ray emission. The near-infrared emission also displayed remarkable variability, including a dip of 20 min in length during which it nearly vanished. Time-resolved optical spectroscopic observations reveal significant changes in the properties of emission lines from the disc and help infer the spectral type of the companion star to be between K0 and K5. We compare the properties of CXOU J110926.4-650224 with those of other tMSPs in the X-ray subluminous disc state and discuss our findings within the context of a recently proposed scenario that explains the phenomenology exhibited by the prototypical tMSP PSR J1023+0038.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we performed a spectro-temporal investigation of the low-mass X-ray binary GX 9+9 using the Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter (LAXPC) and Soft X- ray Telescope (SXT) observation on board AstroSat. The source was detected in the soft state during the observation, which results in a disk dominating energy spectrum within the energy range of 0.7-25.0 keV. We carried out the analysis at different flux levels. In the temporal analysis, LAXPC data in all flux levels showed the presence of noise components, describing broad Lorentzian components. We modeled the energy-dependent temporal properties of the source in order to identify the radiative origin of the observed variability. This source is not a well-studied source; hence we attempt to estimate various source characteristics like inner-disk radius, flux, and inner-disk temperature.

 - **Abstract**
 One way to understand planet formation is through studying the correlations between planet occurrence rates and stellar mass. However, measuring stellar mass in the red giant regime is very difficult. In particular, the spectroscopic masses of certain evolved stars, often referred to as "retired A-stars", have been questioned in the literature. Efforts to resolve this mass controversy using spectroscopy, interferometry and asteroseismology have so far been inconclusive. A recent ensemble study found a mass-dependent mass offset, but the result was based on only 16 stars. With NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we expand the investigation of the mass discrepancy to a total of 92 low-luminosity stars, synonymous with the retired A-stars. We measure their characteristic oscillation frequency, $\mathrm{\nu}_{\mathrm{max}}$, and the large frequency separation, $\mathrm{\Delta\nu}$, from their TESS photometric time series. Using these measurements and asteroseismic scaling relations, we derive asteroseismic masses and compare them with spectroscopic masses from five surveys, to comprehensively study the alleged mass-dependent mass offset. We find a mass offset between spectroscopy and seismology that increases with stellar mass. However, we note that adopting the seismic mass scale does not have a significant effect on the planet occurrence-mass-metallicity correlation for the so-called retired A-stars. We also report seismic measurements and masses for 157 higher luminosity giants (mostly helium-core-burning) from the spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The IBEX-Lo instrument on the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission observes primary and secondary interstellar helium in its 4 lowest energy steps. Observations of these helium populations have been systematically analyzed and compared to simulations using the analytic full integration of neutrals model (aFINM). A systematic difference is observed between the simulations and observations of secondary helium during solar cycle (SC) 24. We show that elastic scattering of primary helium by solar wind protons, which redistributes atoms from the core of the flux distribution, provides an explanation of the observed divergence from simulations. We verify that elastic scattering forms a halo in the wings of the primary He distribution in the spin-angle direction. Correcting the simulation for the effects of elastic scattering requires an increase of the estimated density of primary helium compared to previous estimates by Ulysses/GAS. Thus, based on our analysis of IBEX observations and $\chi ^2$ minimization of simulation data that include the effects of elastic scattering, any estimation of neutral interstellar helium density at 1 AU by direct detection of the peak flux of neutral helium needs to be adjusted by $~\sim$ 10%

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new constraint on the Galactic $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C gradient with sensitive HCO$^+$ absorption observations against strong continuum sources. The new measurements suffer less from beam dilution, optical depths, and chemical fractionation, allowing us to derive the isotopic ratios precisely. The measured $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio in the Solar neighborhood (66$\pm$5) is consistent with those obtained from CH$^+$. Two measurements toward the Galactic Center are 42.2$\pm$1.7 and 37.5$\pm$6.5. Though the values are a factor of 2$\sim$3 higher than those derived from dense gas tracers (e.g., H$_2$CO, complex organic molecules) toward Sagittarius (Sgr) B2 regions, our results are consistent with the absorption measurements from c-C$_3$H$_2$ toward Sgr B2 ($\sim$40), and those from CH$^+$ toward Sgr A$^*$ and Sgr B2(N) ($>$30). We calculate a new Galactic $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C gradient of (6.4$\pm$1.9)$R_{\rm GC}$/kpc+(25.9$\pm$10.5), and find an increasing trend of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C gradient obtained from high-density to low-density gas tracers, suggesting opacity effects and chemical fractionation may have a strong impact on the isotopic ratios observed at high-density regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Mutual neutralization between cations and anions play an important role in determining the charge-balance in certain astrophysical environments. However, empirical data for such reactions involving complex molecular species has been lacking due to challenges in performing experimental studies, leaving the astronomical community to rely on decades old models with large uncertainties for describing these processes in the interstellar medium. Aims: To investigate the mutual neutralization (MN) reaction, C$_{60}^+$ + C$_{60}^-$ $\rightarrow$ C$_{60}^*$ + C$_{60}$, for collisions at interstellar-like conditions. Methods: The mutual neutralization reaction between C$_{60}^+$ and C$_{60}^-$ at collision energies of 100\,meV was studied using the Double ElectroStatic Ion Ring ExpEriment, DESIREE, and its merged-beam capabilities. To aid in the interpretation of the experimental results, semi-classical modeling based on the Landau-Zener approach was performed for the studied reaction. Results: We experimentally identify a narrow range of kinetic energies for the neutral reaction products. Modeling was used to calculate the quantum state-selective reaction probabilities, absolute cross sections, and rate coefficients of these MN reactions, using the experimental results as a benchmark. The MN cross sections are compared with model results for electron attachment to C$_{60}$ and electron recombination with C$_{60}^+$. Conclusions: The present results show that it is crucial to take mutual polarization effects, the finite sizes, and the final quantum states of both molecular ions into account for reliable predictions of MN rates expected to strongly influence the charge-balance and chemistry in, e.g., dense molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spectro-timing analysis of the black hole X-ray transient GX 339-4 using simultaneous observations from Astrosat and NICER during the 2021 outburst period. The combined spectrum obtained from NICER, LAXPC, and SXT data is effectively described by a model comprising a thermal disk component, hard Comptonization component, and reflection component with an edge. Our analysis of the Astrosat and NICER spectra indicates the source to be in a low/hard state, with a photon index of ~1.64. The Power Density Spectra (PDS) obtained from both Astrosat and NICER observations exhibit two prominent broad features at 0.22 Hz and 2.94 Hz. We generated energy-dependent time lag and fractional root mean square (frms) at both frequencies in a broad energy range of 0.5-30 keV and found the presence of hard lags along with a decrease in variability at higher energy levels. Additionally, we discovered that the correlated variations in accretion rate, inner disc radius, coronal heating rate, and the scattering fraction, along with a delay between them, can explain the observed frms and lag spectra for both features.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-high-energy neutrinos and cosmic rays are excellent probes of astroparticle physics phenomena. For astroparticle physics analyses, robust and accurate reconstruction of signal parameters like arrival direction and energy is essential. Current reconstruction methods ignore bin-to-bin noise correlations, which limits reconstruction resolution and so far has prevented calculations of event-by-event uncertainties. In this work, we present a likelihood description of neutrino or cosmic-ray signals in a radio detector with correlated noise, as present in all neutrino and cosmic-ray radio detectors. We demonstrate with a toy-model reconstruction that signal parameters such as energy and direction, including event-by-event uncertainties with correct coverage, can be obtained. Additionally, by correctly accounting for correlations, the likelihood description constrains the best-fit parameters better than alternative methods and thus improves experimental reconstruction capabilities.

 - **Abstract**
 GRS 1716-249 is a stellar-mass black hole in a low-mass X-ray binary that underwent a gaint outburst in 2016/17. In this paper we use simultaneous observations of Insight-HXMT and NuSTAR to determine its basic parameters. The observations were performed during the softest part of the outburst, and the spectra show clear thermal disk emission and reflection features. We have fitted the X-ray energy spectra using the joint fitting method of the continuum and reflection components with the kerrbb2+ relxill model. Since there is a possibility that the distance to this source was previously underestimated, we use the latest distance parameter of 6.9 kpc in our study, in contrast to previous work in which the distance was set at 2.4 kpc. Through spectral fitting of fixing black hole mass at 6.4 $M_{\rm \odot}$, we observe a strong dependence of the derived spin on the distance: $a_{*}=0.972_{-0.005}^{+0.004}$ at an assumed distance of 2.4 kpc and $a_{*}=0.464_{-0.007}^{+0.016}$ at an assumed distance of 6.9 kpc, at a confidence level of 90%. If considering the uncertainties in the distance and black hole mass, there will be a wider range of spin with $a_{*}$ < 0.78. The fitting results with the new distance indicate that GRS 1716-249 harbors a moderate spin black hole with an inclined ($i\sim 40-50^{\circ}$) accretion disk around it. Additionally, we have also found that solely using the method of the reflection component fitting but ignoring the constraints on the spin from the accretion disk component will result in an extremely high spin.

 - **Abstract**
 SWEET-Cat (Stars With ExoplanETs Catalogue) was originally introduced in 2013, and since then, the number of confirmed exoplanets has increased significantly. A crucial step for a comprehensive understanding of these new worlds is the precise and homogeneous characterization of their host stars. We used a large number of high-resolution spectra to continue the addition of new stellar parameters for planet-host stars in SWEET-Cat following the new detection of exoplanets listed both at the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia and at the NASA exoplanet archive. We obtained high-resolution spectra for a significant number of these planet-host stars, either observed by our team or collected through public archives. For FGK stars, the spectroscopic stellar parameters were derived for the spectra following the same homogeneous process using ARES+MOOG as for the previous SWEET-Cat releases. The stellar properties are combined with the planet properties to study possible correlations that could shed more light into the star-planet connection studies. We increase the number of stars with homogeneous parameters by 232 ($\sim$ 25\% - from 959 to 1191). We then focus on the exoplanets with both mass and radius determined to review the mass-radius relation where we find consistent results with the ones previously reported in the literature. For the massive planets we also revisit the radius anomaly where we confirm a metallicity correlation for the radius anomaly already hinted in previous results.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel approach for determining the orbital inclination of low-mass X-ray binary systems by modelling the H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ line profiles emitted by the accretion disc, with a Newtonian version of diskline. We applied the model to two sample sources, Swift J1357.2-0933 and MAXI J1305-704, which are both transient black hole systems, and analyse two observations that were collected during a quiescent state and one observation of an outburst. The line profile is well described by the diskline model, although we had to add a Gaussian line to describe the deep inner core of the double-peaked profile, which the diskline model was unable to reproduce. The H$\beta$ emission lines in the spectrum of Swift J1357.2-0933 and the H$\alpha$ emission lines in that of MAXI J1305-704 during the quiescent state are consistent with a scenario in which these lines originate from a disc ring between $(9.6-57) \times 10^{3}, \rm{R_{g}}$ and $(1.94-20) \times 10^{4}, \rm{R_{g}}$, respectively. We estimate an inclination angle of $81 \pm 5$ degrees for Swift J1357.2-0933 and an angle of $73 \pm 4$ degrees for MAXI J1305-704. This is entirely consistent with the values reported in the literature. In agreement with the recent literature, our analysis of the outburst spectrum of MAXI J1305-704 revealed that the radius of the emission region deviates from expected values. This outcome implies several potential scenarios, including alternative disc configuration or even a circumbinary disc. We caution that these results were derived from a simplistic model that may not fully describe the complicated physics of accretion discs. Despite these limitations, our results for the inclination angles are remarkably consistent with recent complementary studies, and the proposed description of the emitting region remains entirely plausible.

 We review the advantages of fitting with a Two Component Advective Flow (TCAF) which uses only four physical parameters. We then present the results of hydrodynamic simulations to highlight the fact that the primary component of a black hole accretion remains the sub-Keplerian or the low angular momentum flow independent of whether we have a high, intermediate or low mass X-ray binary. Every aspect of spectral and timing properties, including the disk-jet connection could be understood well only if such a component is present along with a Keplerian component of variable size and accretion rate.

 - **Abstract**
 We confirm for the first time the existence of distinctive halo bias associated with the quadrupolar type of statistical anisotropy (SA) of the linear matter density field using cosmological $N$-body simulations. We find that the coefficient of the SA-induced bias for cluster-sized halos takes negative values and exhibits a decreasing trend with increasing halo mass. This results in the quadrupole halo power spectra in a statistically anisotropic universe being less amplified compared to the monopole spectra. The anisotropic feature in halo bias that we found presents a promising new tool for testing the hypothesis of a statistically anisotropic universe, with significant implications for the precise verification of anisotropic inflation scenarios and vector dark matter and dark energy models.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurately characterizing the true redshift (true-$z$) distribution of a photometric redshift (photo-$z$) sample is critical for cosmological analyses in imaging surveys. Clustering-based techniques, which include clustering-redshift (CZ) and self-calibration (SC) methods--depending on whether external spectroscopic data are used--offer powerful tools for this purpose. In this study, we explore the joint inference of the true-$z$ distribution by combining SC and CZ (denoted as SC+CZ). We derive simple multiplicative update rules to perform the joint inference. By incorporating appropriate error weighting and an additional weighting function, our method shows significant improvement over previous algorithms. We validate our approach using a DES Y3 mock catalog. The true-$z$ distribution estimated through the combined SC+CZ method is generally more accurate than using SC or CZ alone. To account for the different constraining powers of these methods, we assign distinct weights to the SC and CZ contributions. The optimal weights, which minimize the distribution error, depend on the relative constraining strength of the SC and CZ data. Specifically, for a spectroscopic redshift sample that represents 1% of the photo-$z$ sample, the optimal combination reduces the total error by 20% (40%) compared to using CZ (SC) alone, and it keeps the bias in mean redshift [$\Delta \bar{z} / (1 + z) $] at the level of 0.3%. Furthermore, when CZ data is only available in the low-$z$ range and the high-$z$ range relies solely on SC data, SC+CZ enables consistent estimation of the true-$z$ distribution across the entire redshift range. Our findings demonstrate that SC+CZ is an effective tool for constraining the true-$z$ distribution, paving the way for clustering-based methods to be applied at $z\gtrsim 1$.

 We characterize blue straggler stars (BSS) and yellow straggler stars (YSS) of an open cluster (OC) Berkeley 39 using multi-wavelength observations including Swift/UVOT. Our analysis also makes use of ultraviolet (UV) data from GALEX, optical data from Gaia DR3 and Pan-STARRS, and infrared data from 2MASS, Spitzer/IRAC, and WISE. Berkeley 39 is a ~6 Gyr old Galactic OC located at a distance of ~4200 pc. We identify 729 sources as cluster members utilizing a machine learning algorithm, ML-MOC, on Gaia DR3 data. Of these, 17 sources are classified as BSS candidates and four as YSS candidates. We construct multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 16 BSS and 2 YSS candidates, within the Swift/UVOT field, to analyze their properties. Out of these, 8 BSS candidates and both the YSS candidates are successfully fitted with single-component SEDs. Five BSS candidates show marginal excess in the near-UV (fractional residual < 0.3 in all but one UVOT filter), whereas three BSS candidates show moderate to significant excess in the near-UV (fractional residual > 0.3 in at least two UVOT filters). We present the properties of the BSS and YSS candidates, estimated based on the SED fits.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate modeling of tidal interactions is crucial for interpreting recent JWST observations of the thermal emissions of TRAPPIST-1~b and c and for characterizing the surface conditions and potential habitability of the other planets in the system. Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by tidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to their proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the TRAPPIST-1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In this work, we present the recent implementation of the co-planar tidal torque and forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N-body code Posidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using a tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of each planet by taking into account their multi-layer internal structure computed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets are not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state. Planet-planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and tides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a result, the sub-stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and long-timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with periods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Recent observations of decayless transverse oscillations have shown two branches in the relationship between periods and loop lengths. One is a linear relationship, interpreted as a standing mode. The other shows almost no correlation and has not yet been interpreted conclusively. Aims. We investigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless oscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely follow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations are standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations where the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase are randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal by considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of telescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast Fourier transform. Results. When the sampling cadence is getting closer to the actual oscillation period, a tendency for overestimating periods in short loops is enhanced. The relationship between loop lengths and periods of the sampled signals shows the two branches as in the observation. Conclusions. We find that long periods of decayless oscillations occurring in short loops could be the result of undersampling.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide stringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post-BBN (Big Bang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models with COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers. Here, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark photon conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous works only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the change to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon distortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the distortion has an opposite sign and a $\simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We furthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover the redshift range $\simeq 2\times 10^6-4\times 10^7$ between the $\mu$-era and the end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints for dark photon masses in the range $10^{-4}\,{\rm eV}\lesssim m_{\rm dp}\lesssim 10^{-3}\,{\rm eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We demonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon to dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $\mu$-type distortion independent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study dark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with CMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are high-mass X-ray binaries with an X-ray luminosity above $10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. These ULXs can be powered by black holes that are more massive than $20M_\odot$, accreting in a standard regime, or lighter compact objects accreting supercritically. There are only a few ULXs with known optical or UV counterparts, and their nature is debated. Determining whether optical/UV radiation is produced by the donor star or by the accretion disc is crucial for understanding ULX physics and testing massive binary evolution. We conduct, for the first time, a fully consistent multi-wavelength spectral analysis of a ULX and its circumstellar nebula. We aim to establish the donor star type and test the presence of strong disc winds in the prototypical ULX Holmberg II X-1 (Ho II X-1). We intent to obtain a realistic spectral energy distribution of the ionising source, which is needed for robust nebula analysis. We acquired new UV spectra of Ho II X-1 with the HST and complemented them with archival optical and X-ray data. We explored the spectral energy distribution of the source and analysed the spectra using the stellar atmosphere code PoWR and the photoionisation code Cloudy. Our analysis of the X-ray, UV, and optical spectra of Ho II X-1 and its nebula consistently explains the observations. We do not find traces of disc wind signatures in the UV and the optical, rejecting previous claims of the ULX being a supercritical accretor. The optical/UV counterpart of HoII X-1 is explained by a B-type supergiant donor star. Thus, the observations are fully compatible with Ho II X-1 being a close binary consisting of an $\gtrsim 66\,M_\odot$ black hole accreting matter from an $\simeq 22 M_\odot$ B-supergiant companion. Also, we propose a possible evolution scenario for the system, suggesting that Ho II X-1 is a potential gravitational wave source progenitor.

 Energetic GeV photons expected from the closest and the most energetic Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provide an unique opportunity to study the very-high-energy emission as well as the possible correlations with lower energy bands in realistic GRB afterglow models. In the standard GRB afterglow model, the relativistic homogeneous shock is usually considered to be fully adiabatic, however, it could be partially radiative. Based on the external forward-shock scenario in both stellar wind and constant-density medium. We present a radiative-adiabatic analytical model of the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) and synchrotron processes considering an electron energy distribution with a power-law index of 1 < p < 2 and 2 $\leq$ p. We show that the SSC scenario plays a relevant role in the radiative parameter $\epsilon$, leading to a prolonged evolution during the slow cooling regime. In a particular case, we derive the Fermi/LAT light curves together with the photons with energies $\geq$ 100 MeV in a sample of nine bursts from the second Fermi/LAT GRB catalog that exhibited temporal and spectral indices with $\geq$ 1.5 and $\approx$ 2, respectively. These events can hardly be described with closure relations of the standard synchrotron afterglow model, and also exhibit energetic photons above the synchrotron limit. We have modeled the multi-wavelength observations of our sample to constrain the microphysical parameters, the circumburst density, the bulk Lorentz factor and the mechanism responsible for explaining the energetic GeV photons.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our local solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions it exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong dynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar). Consequently, it is likely that there are large-scale physical structures within the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we present new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a multi-wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring-like morphology. We estimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring to be 79" and 154", respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre distance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $> 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, a mass of $\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\odot$, and an expansion speed of $\sim$ 20 km s$^{-1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($> 10^{51}$ erg) and momentum ($> 10^7$ M$_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$). We discuss several possible causes for the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback and large-scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring is a single high-energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain the observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have taken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which we now see as the M0.8$-$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an extreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.
