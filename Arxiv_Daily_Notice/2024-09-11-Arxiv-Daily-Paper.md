#### Title:
          A pair of possible supernovae Refsdal in the Pantheon+ sample

 - **Abstract**
 On December 1980, supernova 1980N was discovered in NGC 1316, a galaxy of the Fornax cluster. Three months later, supernova 1981D was observed in the same galaxy. The light curves of these two supernovae Ia were found to be virtually identical, suggesting that they are images of the same event, the delay between them being due to strong gravitational lensing. If so, as anticipated by Sjur Refsdal, the distance to the lens can be determined accurately, namely, 90 $\pm$ 1 kpc, meaning that it belongs to the outer halo of the Milky Way. Interestingly, there is another pair of possible images in the Pantheon+ sample, namely, supernovae 2013aa and 2017cbv, the distance to the lens being 702 $\pm$ 1 kpc, that is, nearly the same as the distance to the Andromeda galaxy. In both cases, given the relatively large angle of deviation of the supernova light by the lens, namely, 271" and 325", respectively, the lens has to be a compact object, with a mass to radius ratio over 150 M$_\odot$ R$_\odot^{-1}$. It is likely to be an ultra massive white dwarf.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent detections of gravitational waves from mergers of binary black holes (BBHs) with pre-merger source-frame individual masses in the so-called upper mass-gap, expected due to (pulsational) pair instability supernova ((P)PISN), have created immense interest in the astrophysical production of high-mass black holes (BHs). Previous studies show that high-mass BHs may be produced via repeated BBH mergers inside dense star clusters. Alternatively, inside dense star clusters, stars with unusually low core-to-envelope mass ratios can form via mergers of high-mass stars, which then can avoid (P)PISN, but produce high-mass BHs via mass fallback. We simulate detailed star-by-star multi-physics models of dense star clusters using the Monte Carlo cluster evolution code, CMC, to investigate the role of primordial binary fraction among high-mass stars (>=15 Msun) on the formation of high-mass BHs. We vary the high-mass stellar binary fraction (fb_15_prime) while keeping all other initial properties, including the population of high-mass stars, unchanged. We find that the number of high-mass BHs, as well as the mass of the most massive BH formed via stellar core-collapse are proportional to fb_15_prime. In contrast, there is no correlation between fb_15_prime and the number of high-mass BHs formed via BH-BH mergers. Since the total production of high-mass BHs is dominated by BH-BH mergers in old clusters, the overall number of high-mass BHs produced over the typical lifetime of globular clusters is insensitive to fb_15_prime. Furthermore, we study the differences in the demographics of BH-BH mergers as a function of fb_15_prime.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars form in dense cores within molecular clouds and newly formed stars influence their natal environments. How stellar feedback impacts core properties and evolution is subject to extensive investigation. We performed a hierarchical clustering (dendrogram) analysis of a STARFORGE simulation modelling a giant molecular cloud to identify gas overdensities (cores) and study changes in their radius, mass, velocity dispersion, and virial parameter with respect to stellar feedback. We binned these cores on the basis of the fraction of gas affected by protostellar outflows, stellar winds, and supernovae and analysed the property distributions for each feedback bin. We find that cores that experience more feedback influence are smaller. Feedback notably enhances the velocity dispersion and virial parameter of the cores, more so than it reduces their radius. This is also evident in the linewidth-size relation, where cores in higher feedback bins exhibit higher velocities than their similarly sized pristine counterparts. We conclude that stellar feedback mechanisms, which impart momentum to the molecular cloud, simultaneously compress and disperse the dense molecular gas.

          The Role of Thermal Feedback in the Growth of Planetary Cores by Pebble Accretion in Dust Traps

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution millimetre-imaging of protoplanetary discs has revealed many containing rings and gaps. These rings can contain large quantities of dust, often in excess of 10M$_\oplus$, providing prime sites for efficient and rapid planet formation. Rapid planet formation will produce high accretion luminosities, heating the surrounding disc. We investigate the importance of a planetary embryo's accretion luminosity by simulating the dynamics of the gas and dust in a dust ring, accounting for the energy liberated as a resident planetary embryo accretes. The resulting heating alters the flow structure near the planet, increasing the accretion rate of large, millimetre-to-centimetre-sized dust grains. We show how this process varies with the mass of dust in the ring and the local background gas temperature, demonstrating that the thermal feedback always acts to increase the planet's mass. This increase in planet mass is driven primarily by the formation of vortices, created by a baroclinic instability once the accreting planet heats the disc significantly outside its Hill radius. The vortices can then migrate with respect to the planet, resulting in a complex interplay between planetary growth, gap-opening, dust trapping and vortex dynamics. Planets formed within dust traps can have masses that exceed the classical pebble isolation mass, potentially providing massive seeds for the future formation of giant planets. Once pebble accretion ceases, the local dust size distribution is depleted in large grains, and much of the remaining dust mass is trapped in the system's L$_5$ Lagrange point, providing potentially observable signatures of this evolution.

          Simulated performance of energy-resolving detectors towards exoplanet imaging with the Habitable Worlds Observatory

 - **Abstract**
 One of the primary science goals of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) as defined by the Astro2020 decadal survey is the imaging of the first Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star. A key technology gap towards reaching this goal are the development of ultra-low-noise photon counting detectors capable of measuring the incredibly low count rates coming from these planets which are at contrasts of $\sim 1 \times 10^{-10}$. Superconducting energy-resolving detectors (ERDs) are a promising technology for this purpose as, despite their technological challenges, needing to be cooled below their superconducting transition temperature ($< 1\mathrm{K}$), they have essentially zero read noise, dark current, or clock-induced charge, and can get the wavelength of each incident photon without the use of additional throughput-reducing filters or gratings that spread light over many pixels. The use of these detectors on HWO will not only impact the science of the mission by decreasing the required exposure times for exo-Earth detection and characterization, but also in a wavefront sensing and control context when used for starlight suppression to generate a dark zone. We show simulated results using both an EMCCD and an ERD to ``dig a dark zone'' demonstrating that ERDs can achieve the same final contrast as an EMCCD in about half of the total time. We also perform a simple case study using an exposure time calculator tool called the Error Budget Software (EBS) to determine the required integration times to detect water for HWO targets of interest using both EMCCDs and ERDs. This shows that once a dark zone is achieved, using an ERD can decrease these exposure times by factors of 1.5--2 depending on the specific host star properties.

          CMB polarization non-Gaussianity from accreting primordial black holes

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) would induce non-Gaussianity in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by sourcing recombination perturbations spatially modulated by relative velocities between PBHs and the baryons they accrete. The leading non-Gaussian signatures are non-vanishing connected 4-point correlation functions, or trispectra. Earlier, we computed the CMB temperature trispectrum, and forecasted Planck to be more sensitive to it than to changes in the CMB temperature power spectrum for light enough PBHs. Excitingly, accreting PBHs would also induce non-Gaussianity in CMB polarization, and source both E and B modes, which we compute in this paper. We first calculate linear-response perturbations to the tensor-valued photon distribution function sourced by a general spatially-varying ionization history, and apply our results to accreting PBHs. We then compute linear-order perturbations to the temperature and polarization 2-point functions sourced by inhomogeneities in recombination due to accreting PBHs; we find them to be negligible relative to their counterparts sourced by homogeneous perturbations to the ionization history. Lastly, we compute all CMB trispectra including temperature, E- and B-mode polarization at linear order in the PBH abundance. We forecast that including polarization data in a 4-point-function analysis would only increase Planck's sensitivity to accreting PBHs by a factor ~2 relative to using temperature alone. As a consequence, we find that a search for PBHs using all temperature and polarization trispectra with Planck data would mostly not be competitive with current bounds from temperature and polarization power spectra. In contrast, we forecast that a CMB Stage-4 experiment would gain significant sensitivity to accreting PBHs through a 4-point-function search, in particular through the contributions of parity-odd trispectra including one B-mode field.

 - **Abstract**
 As mass-losing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars evolve to planetary nebulae (PNe), the mass outflow geometries transform from nearly spherical to extreme aspherical. The physical mechanisms governing this transformation are widely believed to be linked to binarity and the associated production of disks and fast jets during transitional (post-AGB) evolutionary stages. We are carrying out a systematic ALMA survey ($P$re-planet$A$ry $N$ebulae high-angular-res$O$lution su$R$vey with $A$L$MA$ or PANORAMA) of a representative sample of bipolar and multipolar post-AGB objects. We have obtained high angular-resolution (0".1-0".4) observations of the CO(3--2) and/or 6--5 emission in order to probe the spatio-kinematic structure of the collimated outflows and the central disk/torii. The results are remarkable, generally showing the presence of bipolar or multipolar high-velocity outflows, dense toroidal waists, and in one case, a geometrically-thin circular ring around the central bipolar nebula. A high degree of point-symmetry characterizes the morphology of the mass ejecta. In this contribution, we present these and other highlights from our survey. We aim to use 2D/3D radiative transfer modeling in order to derive accurate outflow momenta, masses and mass-loss rates for our sample, and build hydrodynamical models that can explain the observed spatio-kinematic structures. These results will then be used to distinguish between different classes of PN-shaping binary interaction models.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decade and a half, adoption of Bayesian inference in pulsar timing analysis has led to increasingly sophisticated models. The recent announcement of evidence for a stochastic background of gravitational waves by various pulsar timing array projects highlighted Bayesian inference as a central tool for parameter estimation and model selection. Despite its success, Bayesian inference is occasionally misused in the pulsar timing community. A common workflow is that the data is analyzed in multiple steps: a first analysis of single pulsars individually, and a subsequent analysis of the whole array of pulsars. A mistake that is then sometimes introduced stems from using the posterior distribution to craft the prior for the analysis of the same data in a second step, a practice referred to in the statistics literature as ``circular analysis.'' This is done to prune the model for computational efficiency. Multiple recent high-profile searches for gravitational waves by pulsar timing array (PTA) projects have this workflow. This letter highlights this error and suggests that Spike and Slab priors can be used to carry out model averaging instead of model selection in a single pass. Spike and Slab priors are proved to be equal to Log-Uniform priors.

          On the sensitivity of Apophis' 2029 Earth approach to small asteroid impacts

 - **Abstract**
 Apophis' current trajectory takes it safely past our planet at a distance of several Earth radii on 2029 April 13. Here the possibility is considered that Apophis could collide with a small asteroid, like the ones that frequently and unpredictably strike Earth, and the resulting perturbation of its trajectory. The probability of an impact that could significantly displace Apophis relative to its keyholes is found to be less than 1 in $10^6$, requiring a delta-v greater than 0.3 mm/s, while for an impact that could significantly displace Apophis compared to its miss distance in 2029 it is less than 1 in $10^9$, requiring a delta-v greater than 5 cm/s. These probabilities are below the usual thresholds considered by asteroid impact warning systems. Apophis is in the daytime sky and unobservable from mid-2021 to 2027. It will be challenging to determine from single night observations in 2027 if Apophis has moved on the target plane enough to enter a dangerous keyhole, as the deviation from the nominal ephemeris might be only a few tenths of an arcsecond. An impending Earth impact would, however, be signalled clearly in most cases by deviations of tens of arcseconds of Apophis from its nominal ephemeris in 2027. Thus most of the impact risk could be retired by a single observation of Apophis in 2027, though a minority of cases present some ambiguity and are discussed in more detail. Charts of the on-sky position of Apophis under different scenarios are presented for quick assessment by observers.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars form in the Galaxy with a wide range in mass. If the mass is below 7% of the Sun's, then the object does not become hot enough for stable hydrogen burning. These substellar objects are called brown dwarfs. Maps of the sky at infrared wavelengths have found large numbers of brown dwarfs. However only 24 objects have been found (as of April 2017) that are cold enough to be classified as "Y dwarfs": these have atmospheres that are cooler than 500 K (or 200 C, 400 F) and have masses only 5 - 20 times that of Jupiter. The coolest Y dwarf currently known, discovered in 2014, has a temperature around freezing, has a mass of about 5 Jupiter masses, and is only 2 pc away from the Sun. These small and cold objects are faint and difficult to find. This chapter describes the discovery and characterization of the Y dwarfs. Finding more of these very cold planet-like brown dwarfs will require an as-yet unplanned space mission mapping large areas of sky at wavelengths around 5 microns.

          No Redshift Evolution in the Fe II/Mg II Flux Ratios of Quasars across Cosmic Time

 - **Abstract**
 The Fe II/Mg II emission line flux ratio in quasar spectra serves as a proxy for the relative Fe to alpha-element abundances in the broad line regions of quasars. Due to the expected different enrichment timescales of the two elements, they can be used as a cosmic clock in the early Universe. We present a study of the Fe II/Mg II ratios in a sample of luminous quasars exploiting high-quality near-IR spectra taken primarily by the XQR-30 program with VLT XSHOOTER. These quasars have a median bolometric luminosity of log(L_bol[erg s^-1])~47.3 and cover a redshift range of z=6.0-6.6. The median value of the measured Fe II/Mg II ratios is ~7.9 with a normalized median absolute deviation of ~2.2. In order to trace the cosmic evolution of Fe II/Mg II in an unbiased manner, we select two comparison samples of quasars with similar luminosities and high-quality spectra from the literature, one at intermediate redshifts (z=3.5-4.8) and the other at low redshifts (z=1.0-2.0). We perform the same spectral analysis for all these quasars, including the usage of the same iron template, the same spectral fitting method, and the same wavelength fitting windows. We find no significant redshift evolution in the Fe II/Mg II ratio over the wide redshift range from z=1 to 6.6. The result is consistent with previous studies and supports the scenario of a rapid iron enrichment in the vicinity of accreting supermassive black holes at high redshift.

          FAST Observations of Four Comets to Search for the Molecular Line Emissions between 1.0 and 1.5 GHz Frequencies

 - **Abstract**
 We used the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to search for the molecular emissions in the L-band between 1.0 and 1.5 GHz toward four comets, C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE), C/2020 R4 (ATLAS), C/2021 A1 (Leonard), and 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during or after their perihelion passages. Thousands of molecular transition lines fall in this low-frequency range, many attributed to complex organic or prebiotic molecules. We conducted a blind search for the possible molecular lines in this frequency range in those comets and could not identify clear signals of molecular emissions in the data. Although several molecules have been detected at high frequencies of great than 100 GHz in comets, our results confirm that it is challenging to detect molecular transitions in the L-band frequency ranges. The non-detection of L-band molecular lines in the cometary environment could rule out the possibility of unusually strong lines, which could be caused by the masers or non-LTE effects. Although the line strengths are predicted to be weak, for FAST, using the ultra-wide bandwidth receiver and improving the radio frequency interference environments would enhance the detectability of those molecular transitions at low frequencies in the future.

          Stability and fate of hierarchical triples comprising a central massive body and a tight binary in eccentric orbits

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the stability and fate of gravitational triple systems comprising a central massive body and a tight binary of less massive pairs. Our present purpose is two fold; (1) to improve the Hill-type stability criterion for the binary in those systems, and (2) to examine the fate of the triple systems after the binary break-up, with particular attention to the effects of the eccentricities of the inner and outer orbits. We perform direct Newtonian N-body simulations over much longer integration times than previous studies, which is essential to determine the eventual fate of those systems statistically in a reliable fashion. We obtain an empirical fitting formula of the binary stability boundary that incorporates effects of the inner and outer eccentricities, the mutual inclination of the inner and outer orbits, and the mass ratios of the three bodies. We also find that those triple systems are stable for a much longer timescale after the binary break-up, and that their final fates (ejection of the outer body, merger to the central massive body, and collision of two less massive bodies) are very sensitive to the initial outer eccentricity.

          Volatile-rich Sub-Neptunes as Hydrothermal Worlds: The Case of K2-18 b

 - **Abstract**
 Temperate exoplanets between the sizes of Earth and Neptune, known as "sub-Neptunes", have emerged as intriguing targets for astrobiology. It is unknown whether these planets resemble Earth-like terrestrial worlds with a habitable surface, Neptune-like giant planets with deep atmospheres and no habitable surface, or something exotic in between. Recent JWST transmission spectroscopy observations of the canonical sub-Neptune K2-18 b revealed ~1% CH4, ~1% CO2, and a non-detection of CO in the atmosphere. While previous studies have proposed that the observed atmospheric composition could help constrain the lower atmosphere conditions and determine the interior structure of sub-Neptunes like K2-18 b, the possible interactions between the atmosphere and a hot, supercritical water ocean at its base remain unexplored. In this work, we investigate whether a global supercritical water ocean, resembling a planetary-scale hydrothermal system, can explain these observations on K2-18 b-like sub-Neptunes through equilibrium aqueous geochemical calculations. We find that the observed atmospheric CH4/CO2 ratio implies a minimum ocean temperature of ~715 K, whereas the corresponding CO/CO2 ratio allows ocean temperatures up to ~1060 K. These results indicate that a global supercritical water ocean on K2-18 b is plausible. While life cannot survive in this ocean, this work represents the first step towards understanding how a global supercritical water ocean may influence observable atmospheric characteristics on volatile-rich sub-Neptunes. Future observations with better constrained NH3 and CO mixing ratios could further help distinguish between possible interior compositions of K2-18 b.

 - **Abstract**
 High-precision and high-cadence photometric surveys such as Kepler or TESS are making huge progress not only in the detection of new extrasolar planets but also in the study of a great number of variable stars. This is the case for central stars of planetary nebulae (PNe), which have similarly benefited from the capabilities of these missions, increasing the number of known binary central stars and helping us to constrain the relationship between binarity and the complex morphologies of their host PNe. In this paper, we analyse the TESS light curves of a large sample of central stars of PNe with the aim of detecting signs of variability that may hint at the presence of short-period binary nuclei. We analysed 62 central stars of true, likely, or possible PNe and modelled the detected variability through an MCMC approach accounting for three effects: reflection, ellipsoidal modulations, and Doppler beaming. Among the 62 central stars, only 38 are amenable for this study. The remaining 24 show large contamination from nearby sources preventing an optimal analysis. Also, eight targets are already known binary central stars, which we revisit here with the new high precision of the TESS data. In addition, we find that 18 further central stars show clear signs of periodic variability in the TESS data, probably resulting from different physical effects compatible with the binary scenario. We propose them as new candidate binary central stars. We also discuss the origin of the detected variability in each particular case by using the TESS_localize algorithm. Finally, 12 targets show no or only weak evidence of variability at the sensitivity of TESS. Our study demonstrates the power of space-based photometric surveys in searching for close binary companions of central stars of PNe.

          A potential mass-gap black hole in a wide binary with a circular orbit

 - **Abstract**
 Mass distribution of black holes identified through X-ray emission suggests a paucity of black holes in the mass range of 3 to 5 solar masses. Modified theories have been devised to explain this mass gap, and it is suggested that natal kicks during supernova explosion can more easily disrupt binaries with lower mass black holes. Although recent LIGO observations reveal the existence of compact remnants within this mass gap, the question of whether low-mass black holes can exist in binaries remains a matter of debate. Such a system is expected to be noninteracting without X-ray emission, and can be searched for using radial velocity and astrometric methods. Here we report Gaia DR3 3425577610762832384, a wide binary system including a red giant star and an unseen object, exhibiting an orbital period of approximately 880 days and near-zero eccentricity. Through the combination of radial velocity measurements from LAMOST and astrometric data from Gaia DR2 and DR3 catalogs, we determine a mass of $3.6^{+0.8}_{-0.5}$ $M_{\odot}$ of the unseen component. This places the unseen companion within the mass gap, strongly suggesting the existence of binary systems containing low-mass black holes. More notably, the formation of its surprisingly wide circular orbit challenges current binary evolution and supernova explosion theories.

 - **Abstract**
 Quantum evaporation of a black hole is conventionally studied semiclassically by assuming self-similarity of the black hole throughout the evaporation process. However, its validity was recently questioned, and the lifetime of a black hole is conjectured to be much extended by the memory burden effect. It gives rise to the possibility that the primordial black holes (PBHs) lighter than $10^{10}$ grams are the dark matter in the Universe. To probe such PBH dark matter, we study gravitational waves (GWs) induced by primordial curvature perturbations that produced the PBHs. We find $\Omega_\text{GW}(f_\text{peak})h^2 = 7 \times 10^{-9}$ with the peak frequency $f_\text{peak} = 1\times 10^{3} \, (M_\text{PBH}/(10^{10}\,\mathrm{g}))^{-1/2}\, \mathrm{Hz}$, and the induced GWs associated with the PBH dark matter whose initial mass is greater than about $10^7$ grams can be tested by future observations such as Cosmic Explorer. Furthermore, the scenario can be in principle confirmed by detecting another GW signal from the mergers of PBHs, which leads to high-frequency GWs with $f_\text{peak} = 2 \times 10^{27}\, (M_\text{PBH, ini}/(10^{10}\, \mathrm{g}))^{-1} \, \mathrm{Hz} $. On the other hand, the induced GW signals stronger than expected would contradict the dark matter abundance and exclude the memory burden effect.

 An ongoing challenge for radio-based detectors of high-energy cosmic particles is the accurate description of radio signal propagation in natural non-uniform media. For radio signals originating from extensive air showers, the current state of the art simulations often implicitly assume straight-line signal propagation. This while the refraction due to a non-uniform atmosphere is expected to have an effect on the received signal and associated reconstruction that is currently not completely understood for the most inclined geometries. Here, we present a study regarding the validity of assuming straight-line signal propagation when simulating radio emission associated with very inclined air shower geometries. To this end, the calculation of the electric field based on the end-point formalism used in CoREAS was improved by use of tabulated ray tracing data. We find that including ray curvature effects into the end-point formalism calculation introduces changes of up to a few percent in fluence for frequencies up to 1.2 GHz and zenith angles up to 88°.

 - **Abstract**
 Energy-dependence of X-ray Fourier power spectral states and the characteristic frequencies of the Band-Limited Noise (BLN) components have been seen in the hard state and intermediate states of black hole X-ray binaries. Here we report our analysis of the \emph{Insight}-HXMT observations of the black hole transient MAXI J1820$+$070 during its 2018 outburst when the source was brightest in hard X-rays. We found opposite trends of the low-frequency ($<$ 0.1 Hz) and the high-frequency ($>$ 10 Hz) BLN components, i.e., decreasing vs. increasing in frequency with increasing photon energy up to beyond 200 keV, respectively. This establishes an apparent two-way broadening of the power plateau formed by multiple BLNs in the power spectra towards higher photon energies. The trend of increasing characteristic frequency of the highest BLN component with increasing photon energy has been interpreted as due to that the corresponding seed photons which are up-scatted to relatively higher energies originate in a region relatively more central in the corona previously. Following the same framework, the decreasing trend of the characteristic frequency of the low-frequency BLN component with increasing photon energy can be interpreted as due to that the corresponding seed photons which are up-scattered to higher photon energies originate from further out in the disk flow but on the opposite side of the central corona as to the observer. The opposite trends then implies that the the plateau in the power spectra formed by the multiple BLNs represents the radial extension of the accretion disk that contributes seed photons which produce the observed BLNs; the higher the photon energy is, the wider the power plateau and the smaller the fractional variability are, probably approaching to a Power-Law Noise (PLN) seen in the soft state.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce the Contour Analysis Tool (CAT), a Python toolkit aimed at identifying and analyzing structural elements in density maps. CAT employs various contouring techniques, including the lowest-closed contour (LCC), linear and logarithmic Otsu thresholding, and average gradient thresholding. These contours can aid in foreground and background segmentation, providing natural limits for both, as well as edge detection and structure identification. Additionally, CAT provides image processing methods such as smoothing, background removal, and image masking. The toolkit features an interactive suite of controls designed for Jupyter environments, enabling users to promptly visualize the effects of different methods and parameters. We describe, test, and demonstrate the performance of CAT, highlighting its potential use cases. CAT is publicly available on GitHub, promoting accessibility and collaboration.

 - **Abstract**
 We have developed a new set of Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) of the TARGET family (CTC and CT5TEA), designed for the readout of signals from photosensors in cameras of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) for ground-based gamma-ray astronomy. We present the performance and design details. Both ASICs feature 16 channels, with CTC being a Switched-Capacitor Array (SCA) sampler at 0.5 to 1 GSa/s with a 16,384 sample deep storage buffer, including the functionality to digitize full waveforms at arbitrary times. CT5TEA is its companion trigger ASIC (though may be used on its own), which provides trigger information for the analog sum of four (and 16) adjacent channels. Since sampling and triggering takes place in two separate ASICs, the noise due to interference from the SCA is suppressed, and allows a minimal trigger threshold of $\leq$ 2.5 mV (0.74 photo electrons (p.e.)) with a trigger noise of $\leq$ 0.5 mV (0.15 p.e.). For CTC, a maximal input voltage range from $-$0.5 V up to 1.7 V is achieved with an effective bit range of $>$ 11.6 bits and a baseline noise of 0.7 mV. The cross-talk improved to $\leq$ 1% over the whole $-$3 dB bandwidth of 220 MHz and even down to 0.2% for 1.5 V pulses of 10 ns width. Not only is the performance presented, but a temperature-stable calibration routine for pulse mode operation is introduced and validated. The resolution is found to be $\sim$ 2.5% at 33.7 mV (10 p.e.) and $\leq$ 0.3% at 337 mV (100 p.e.) with an integrated non-linearity of $<$ 1.6 mV. Developed for the Small-Sized Telescope (SST) and Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (SCT) cameras of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), CTC and CT5TEA are deployed for both prototypes and shall be integrated into the final versions.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. (4015) Wilson-Harrington (hereafter, WH) was discovered as a comet in 1949 but has a dynamical property consistent with that of a near-Earth asteroid. Although there is a report that the 1949 activity is associated with an ion tail, the cause of the activity has not yet been identified. Aims. This work aims to reveal the mysterious comet-like activity of the near-Earth asteroid. Methods. We conducted new polarimetric observations of WH from May 2022 to January 2023, reanalyses of the photographic plate images taken at the time of its discovery in 1949, and dust tail simulation modelings, where the dust terminal velocity and ejection epoch are taken into account. Results. We found that this object shows polarization characteristics similar to those of low-albedo asteroids. We derived the geometric albedo ranging from pV = 0.076 +- 0.010 to pV = 0.094 +- 0.018 from our polarimetry (the values vary depending on the data used for fitting and the slope-albedo relationship coefficients). In addition, the 1949 image showed an increase in brightness around the nucleus. Furthermore, we found that the color of the tail is consistent with sunlight, suggesting that the 1949 activity is associated with dust ejection. From the dust tail analysis, ~9 x 10^5 kg of material was ejected episodically at a low velocity equivalent to or even slower than the escape velocity. Conclusions. We conclude that WH is most likely an active asteroid of main belt origin and that the activity in 1949 was likely triggered by mass shedding due to fast rotation.

 - **Abstract**
 Third generation and future upgrades of current gravitational-wave detectors will present exquisite sensitivities which will allow to detect a plethora of gravitational wave signals. Hence, a new problem to be solved arises: the detection and parameter estimation of overlapped signals. The problem of separating and identifying two signals that overlap in time, space or frequency is something well known in other fields (e.g. medicine and telecommunication). Blind source separation techniques are all those methods that aim at separating two or more unknown signals. This article provides a methodological review of the most common blind source separation techniques and it analyses whether they can be successfully applied to overlapped gravitational wave signals or not, while comparing the limits and advantages of each method.

 - **Abstract**
 In the instant preheating scenario efficient particle production occurs immediately following the period of inflationary expansion in the early Universe. We demonstrate that instant preheating predicts unique gravitational wave (GW) signals arising from two distinct origins. One source is the bremsstrahlung GWs produced through the decay of superheavy particles, an inevitable consequence of instant preheating. The other is GWs generated from the nonlinear dynamics of the inflaton and coupled scalar fields. Using numerical simulations, we show that the peak of the GW spectrum shifts depending on the coupling constants of the theory. The detection of these dual GW signatures, characteristic of instant preheating, provides novel opportunities for probing the dynamics of the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 This work describes the instrumental error budget for space-based measurements of the absolute flux of the sky synchrotron spectrum at frequencies below the ionospheric cutoff (<20 MHz). We focus on an architecture using electrically short dipoles onboard a small satellite. The error budget combines the contributions of the dipole dimensions, plasma noise, stray capacitance, and front-end amplifier input impedance. We treat the errors using both a Monte Carlo error propagation model and an analytical method. This error budget can be applied to a variety of experiments and used to ultimately improve the sensing capabilities of space-based electrically short dipole instruments. The impact of individual uncertainty components, particularly stray capacitance, is explored in more detail.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive black hole binary (MBHB) mergers will be detectable in large numbers by the Lisa Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), which will thus provide new insights on how they form via repeated dark matter (DM) halo and galaxy mergers. Here we present a simple analytical model to generate a population of MBHB mergers based on a theoretical prescription that connects them to DM halo mergers. The high flexibility of our approach allows us to explore the broad and uncertain range of MBH seeding and growth mechanisms, as well as the different effects behind the interplay between MBH and galactic astrophysics. Such a flexibility is fundamental for the successful implementation and optimisation of the hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation approach that here we apply to the MBHB population of LISA for the first time. Our inferred population hyper-parameters are chosen as proxies to characterise the MBH--DM halo mass scaling relation, the occupation fraction of MBHs in DM halos and the delay between halo and MBHB mergers. We find that LISA will provide tight constraints at the lower-end of the MBH-halo scaling relation, well complementing EM observations which are biased towards large masses. Furthermore, our results suggest that LISA will constrain some features of the MBH occupation fraction at high redshift, as well as merger time delays of the order of a few hundreds of Myr, opening the possibility to constrain dynamical evolution time scales such as the dynamical friction. The analysis presented here constitutes a first attempt at developing a hierarchical Bayesian inference approach to the LISA MBHB population, opening the way for several further improvements and investigations.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the perturbed-from-synchronous librational state of a double asteroid, modeled by the Full Two Rigid Body Problem (F2RBP), with primary emphasis on deriving analytical formulas which describe the system's evolution after deflection by a kinetic impactor. To this end, both a linear and nonlinear (canonical) theory are developed. We make the simplifying approximations (to be relaxed in a forthcoming paper) of planar binary orbit and axisymmetric shape of the primary body. To study the effect of a DART-like hit on the secondary body, the momentum transfer enhancement parameter $\beta$ is introduced and retained as a symbolic variable throughout all formulas derived, either by linear or nonlinear theory. Our approach can be of use in the context of the analysis of the post impact data from kinetic impactor missions, by providing a precise modeling of the impactor's effect on the seconadry's librational state as a function of $\beta$.

 - **Abstract**
 Stage IV large scale structure surveys are promising probes of gravity on cosmological scales. Due to the vast model-space in the modified gravity literature, model-independent parameterisations represent useful and scalable ways to test extensions of $\Lambda$CDM. In this work we use a recently validated approach of computing the non-linear $3\times 2$pt observables in modified gravity models with a time-varying effective gravitational constant $\mu$ and a gravitational slip $\eta$ that is binned in redshift to produce Fisher forecasts for an LSST Y10-like survey. We also include in our modelling an effective nulling scheme for weak-lensing by applying the BNT transformation that localises the weak-lensing kernel enabling well-informed scale cuts. We show that the combination of improved non-linear modelling and better control of the scales that are modelled/cut yields high precision constraints on the cosmological and modified gravity parameters. We find that 4 redshift bins for $\mu$ of width corresponding to equal incremental $\Lambda$CDM growth is optimal given the state-of-the-art modelling and show how the BNT transformation can be used to mitigate the impact of small-scale systematic effects, such as baryonic feedback.

          Are the shape and flux of X-ray reflection spectra in hard state consistent with an accretion disk reaching close to the black hole?

 - **Abstract**
 The observed spectra from black hole (BH) X-ray binaries (XRBs) typically consist of two primary components: multitemperature blackbody (BB) originating from the accretion disk in soft X-ray, and a power-law like component in hard X-ray due to Comptonization of soft photons by the hot corona. Illumination of the disk by the corona gives rise to another key component known as reflection. A fraction of the incident hard X-ray radiation is naturally absorbed and re-emitted as a BB at lower energies, referred to as reprocessed BB. For densities relevant to XRBs and typical ionization values, the reprocessed BB may become significant in the soft X-ray region and should be noticeable in the observed spectra as a consequence of reflection. The absence of any BB component in the low/hard state of BH XRB may not be consistent with reflection of high irradiating flux observed as power-law from appropriately dense disk of XRB. We focus on the low/hard state of the BH XRB MAXI J1820+070. We simultaneously fit the shape and flux of the reflection spectra, allowing us to estimate the correct density and ionization of the slab and, correspondingly, the reprocessed BB. Our fitting suggests that the disk in principle may extend close to the BH and still the reprocessed BB due to disk illumination remains small enough to be consistent with the data as opposed to earlier study. The inner reflection component is highly ionized and its fit is primarily driven by its contribution to the continuum. The reprocessed BB cannot resolve whether the disk is extended close to the BH or not in the hard state. For this specific observation, the flux in inner reflection component turns out to be quite low with respect to outer reflection or power-law. Outflowing slab corona covering the inner region of the disk could be the possible geometry of the source with the underlying disk reaching close to the BH. (shortened)

          Bulk and atmospheric metallicities as direct probes of sequentially varying accretion mechanisms of gas and solids onto planets

 - **Abstract**
 Core accretion is the standard scenario of planet formation, wherein planets are formed by sequential accretion of gas and solids, and is widely used to interpret exoplanet observations. However, no direct probes of the scenario have been discussed yet. Here, we introduce an onion-like model as one idealization of sequential accretion and propose that bulk and atmospheric metallicities of exoplanets can be used as direct probes of the process. Our analytical calculations, coupled with observational data, demonstrate that the trend of observed exoplanets supports the sequential accretion hypothesis. In particular, accretion of planetesimals that are $\gtrsim $ 100 km in size is most favored to consistently explain the observed trends. The importance of opening gaps in both planetesimal and gas disks following planetary growth is also identified. New classification is proposed, wherein most observed planets are classified into two interior statuses: globally mixed and locally (well-)mixed. Explicit identification of the locally (well-)mixed status enables reliable verification of sequential accretion. During the JWST era, the quality and volume of observational data will increase drastically and improve exoplanet characterization. This work provides one key reference of how both the bulk and atmospheric metallicities can be used to constrain gas and solid accretion mechanisms of planets.

          Slow Rotation for the Super-Puff Planet Kepler-51d

 - **Abstract**
 Super-puffs are low-density planets of unknown origin and composition. If they form by accreting nebular gas through a circumplanetary disk, one might expect super-puffs to be spinning quickly. Here, we derive upper limits on the rotational oblateness of the super-puff Kepler-51d, based on precise transit observations with the NIRSpec instrument aboard the James Webb Space Telescope. The absence of detectable oblateness-related anomalies in the light curve leads to an upper limit of about $0.15$ on the planet's sky-projected oblateness. Assuming the sky-projected oblateness to be representative of the true oblateness, the rotation period of Kepler-51d is $\gtrsim 40$ hours, or equivalently, its rotation speed is $\lesssim 42\%$ of the breakup speed. Alternatively, if the apparently low density of Kepler-51d is due to an opaque planetary ring, the ring must be oriented within $27°$ of face-on and have an inner radius smaller than $1.2$ times the planet's radius. The lack of anomalies exceeding $0.01\%$ in the ingress and egress portions of the light curve also places a constraint on the model of Wang & Dai, in which the planet's apparently low density is due to a dusty outflowing atmosphere.
