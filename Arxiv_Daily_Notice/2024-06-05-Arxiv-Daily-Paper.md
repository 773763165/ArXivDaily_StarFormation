 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the emergence phase of young star clusters in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628. We use JWST NIRCam and MIRI observations to create spatially resolved maps of the Pa$\alpha$-1.87 $\mu$m and Br$\alpha$-4.05 $\mu$m hydrogen recombination lines, as well as the 3.3 $\mu$m and 7.7 $\mu$m emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We extract 953 compact HII regions and analyze the PAH emission and morphology at ~10 pc scales in the associated photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). While HII regions remain compact, radial profiles help us to define three PAH morphological classes: compact (~ 42%), extended (~ 34%) and open (~24%). The majority of compact and extended PAH morphologies are associated with very young star clusters (<5 Myr), while open PAH morphologies are mainly associated with star clusters older than 3 Myr. We observe a general decrease in the 3.3 $\mu$m and 7.7 $\mu$m PAH band emission as a function of cluster age, while their ratio remains constant with age out to 10 Myr and morphological class. The recovered PAH$_{3.3 \mu{\rm m}}$/PAH$_{7.7 \mu{\rm m}}$ ratio is lower than values reported in the literature for reference models and analyses conducted at larger physical scales. The 3.3 $\mu$m and 7.7 $\mu$m bands are typically associated to neutral and ionised PAHs, respectively. While we expected neutral PAHs to be suppressed in proximity of the ionizing source, the constant PAH$_{3.3 \mu{\rm m}}$/PAH$_{7.7 \mu{\rm m}}$ ratio would indicate that both families of molecules disrupt at similar rates in proximity of the HII regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars grazing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on bound orbits may produce periodic flares over many passages, known as repeating partial tidal disruption events (TDEs). Here we present 3D hydrodynamic simulations of sun-like stars over multiple tidal encounters. The star is significantly restructured and becomes less concentrated as a result of mass loss and tidal heating. The vulnerability to mass loss depends sensitively on the stellar density structure, and the strong correlation between the fractional mass loss $\Delta M/M_*$ and the ratio of the central and average density $\rho_{\mathrm{c}}/\bar\rho$, which was initially derived in disruption simulations of main-sequence stars, also applies for stars strongly reshaped by tides. Over multiple orbits, the star loses progressively more mass in each encounter and is doomed to a complete disruption. Throughout its lifetime, the star may produce numerous weak flares (depending on the initial impact parameter), followed by a couple of luminous flares whose brightness increases exponentially. Flux-limited surveys are heavily biased towards the brightest flares, which may appear similar to the flare produced by the same star undergoing a full disruption on its first tidal encounter. This places new challenges on constraining the intrinsic TDE rates, which needs to take repeating TDEs into account. Other types of stars with different initial density structure (e.g., evolved stars with massive cores) follow distinct evolution tracks, which might explain the diversity of the long-term luminosity evolution seen in recently uncovered repeaters.

 - **Abstract**
 We report long baseline interferometric observations with the CHARA Array that resolve six previously known double-lined spectroscopic binary systems in the Hyades cluster, with orbital periods ranging from 3 to 358 days: HD 27483, HD 283882, HD 26874, HD 27149, HD 30676, and HD 28545. We combine those observations with new and existing radial-velocity measurements, to infer the dynamical masses for the components as well as the orbital parallaxes. For most stars the masses are determined to better than 1%. Our work significantly increases the number of systems with mass determinations in the cluster. We find that while current models of stellar evolution for the age and metallicity of the Hyades are able to reproduce the overall shape of the empirical mass-luminosity relation, they overestimate the $V$-band fluxes by about 0.1 mag between 0.5 and 1.4 $M_{\odot}$. The disagreement is smaller in $H$, and near zero in $K$, and depends somewhat on the model. We also make use of the TESS light curves to estimate rotation periods for our targets, and detect numerous flares in one of them (HD 283882), estimating an average flaring rate of 0.44 events per day.

 - **Abstract**
 The infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is predicted to displace the inner Milky Way (MW), imprinting an apparent 'reflex motion' on the observed velocities of distant halo stars. We construct the largest all-sky spectroscopic dataset of luminous red giant stars from $50-160$ kpc, including a new survey of the southern celestial hemisphere. We fit the full 6D kinematics of our data to measure the amplitude and direction of the inner MW's motion towards the outer halo. The observed velocity grows with distance such that, relative to halo stars at $100$ kpc, the inner MW is lurching at $\approx 40$ km s$^{-1}$ towards a recent location along the LMC's past orbit. Our measurements align with N-body simulations of the halo's response to a $1.8 \times 10^{11} M_\odot$ LMC on first infall, suggesting that the LMC is at least 15% as massive as the MW. Our findings highlight the dramatic disequilibrium of the MW outskirts, and will enable more accurate measurements of the total mass of our Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 $\omega$ Centauri, the most massive globular cluster in the Milky Way, has long been suspected to be the stripped nucleus of a dwarf galaxy that fell into the Galaxy a long time ago. There is considerable evidence for this scenario including a large spread in metallicity and an unusually large number of distinct sub-populations seen in photometric studies. In this work, we use new MUSE spectroscopic and HST photometric catalogs to investigate the underlying metallicity distributions as well as the spatial variations of the populations within the cluster up to its half-light radius. Based on 11,050 member stars, the [M/H] distribution has a median of $ (-1.614 \pm 0.003)$ dex and a large spread of $\sim$ 1.37 dex reaching from $ -0.67$ dex to $ -2.04$ dex for 99.7 % of the stars. In addition, we show the chromosome map of the cluster, which separates the red giant branch stars into different sub-populations, and analyze the sub-populations of the metal-poorest component. Finally, we do not find any metallicity gradient within the half-light radius, and the different sub-populations are well mixed.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the X-ray polarization properties of the high-synchrotron-peaked (HSP) blazar PKS 2155$-$304 based on observations with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). We observed the source between Oct 27 and Nov 7, 2023. We also conducted an extensive contemporaneous multiwavelength (MW) campaign. We find that during the first half ($T_1$) of the IXPE pointing, the source exhibited the highest X-ray polarization degree detected for an HSP blazar thus far, (30.7$\pm$2.0)%, which dropped to (15.3$\pm$2.1)% during the second half ($T_2$). The X-ray polarization angle remained stable during the IXPE pointing at 129.4$^\circ$$\pm$1.8$^\circ$ and 125.4$^\circ$$\pm$3.9$^\circ$ during $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively. Meanwhile, the optical polarization degree remained stable during the IXPE pointing, with average host-galaxy-corrected values of (4.3$\pm$0.7)% and (3.8$\pm$0.9)% during the $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively. During the IXPE pointing, the optical polarization angle changed achromatically from $\sim$140$^\circ$ to $\sim$90$^\circ$ and back to $\sim$130$^\circ$. Despite several attempts, we only detected (99.7% conf.) the radio polarization once (during $T_2$, at 225.5 GHz): with degree (1.7$\pm$0.4)% and angle 112.5$^\circ$$\pm$5.5$^\circ$. The direction of the broad pc-scale jet is rather ambiguous and has been found to point to the east and south at different epochs; however, on larger scales (> 1.5 pc) the jet points toward the southeast ($\sim$135$^\circ$), similar to all of the MW polarization angles. Moreover, the X-ray to optical polarization degree ratios of $\sim$7 and $\sim$4 during $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively, are similar to previous IXPE results for several HSP blazars. These findings, combined with the lack of correlation of temporal variability between the MW polarization properties, agree with an energy-stratified shock-acceleration scenario in HSP blazars.

 - **Abstract**
 We show with Gaia XP spectroscopy that extremely metal-rich stars in the Milky Way (EMR; $[M/H]_{XP} > 0.5$) - but only those - are largely confined to a tight "knot" at the center of the Galaxy. This EMR knot is round in projection, has a fairly abrupt edge near $\sim 1.5$kpc, and is a dynamically hot system. This central knot also contains very metal-rich (VMR; $+0.2\le [M/H]_{XP} \le +0.4$) stars. However, in contrast to EMR stars, the bulk of VMR stars form an extended, highly flattened distribution in the inner Galaxy ($R_{\mathrm{GC}}\lesssim 5$ kpc). We draw on TNG50 simulations of Milky Way analogs for context and find that compact, metal-rich knots confined to $<1.5$kpc are a universal feature. In typical simulated analogs, the top 5-10% most metal-rich stars are confined to a central knot; however, in our Milky Way data this fraction is only 0.1%. Dust-penetrating wide-area near-infrared spectroscopy, such as SDSS-V, will be needed for a rigorous estimate of the fraction of stars in the Galactic EMR knot. Why in our Milky Way only EMR giants are confined to such a central knot remains to be explained. Remarkably, the central few kiloparsecs of the Milky Way harbor both the highest concentration of metal-poor stars (the `poor old heart') and almost all EMR stars. This highlights the stellar population diversity at the bottom of galactic potential wells.

 - **Abstract**
 CHEOPS is a space telescope specifically designed to monitor transiting exoplanets orbiting bright stars. In September 2023, CHEOPS completed its nominal mission and remains in excellent operational conditions. The mission has been extended until the end of 2026. Scientific and instrumental data have been collected throughout in-orbit commissioning and nominal operations, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the mission's performance. In this article, we present the results of this analysis with a twofold goal. First, we aim to inform the scientific community about the present status of the mission and what can be expected as the instrument ages. Secondly, we intend for this publication to serve as a legacy document for future missions, providing insights and lessons learned from the successful operation of CHEOPS. To evaluate the instrument performance in flight, we developed a comprehensive monitoring and characterisation programme. It consists of dedicated observations that allow us to characterise the instrument's response. In addition to the standard collection of nominal science and housekeeping data, these observations provide input for detecting, modelling, and correcting instrument systematics, discovering and addressing anomalies, and comparing the instrument's actual performance with expectations. The precision of the CHEOPS measurements has enabled the mission objectives to be met and exceeded. Careful modelling of the instrumental systematics allows the data quality to be significantly improved during the light curve analysis phase, resulting in more precise scientific measurements. CHEOPS is compliant with the driving scientific requirements of the mission. Although visible, the ageing of the instrument has not affected the mission's performance.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate photometric redshift (photo-$z$) estimation requires support from multi-band observational data. However, in the actual process of astronomical observations and data processing, some sources may have missing observational data in certain bands for various reasons. This could greatly affect the accuracy and reliability of photo-$z$ estimation for these sources, and even render some estimation methods unusable. The same situation may exist for the upcoming Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST). In this study, we employ a deep learning method called Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN) to impute the missing photometric data in CSST, aiming to reduce the impact of data missing on photo-$z$ estimation and improve estimation accuracy. Our results demonstrate that using the GAIN technique can effectively fill in the missing photometric data in CSST. Particularly, when the data missing rate is below 30\%, the imputation of photometric data exhibits high accuracy, with higher accuracy in the $g$, $r$, $i$, $z$, and $y$ bands compared to the $NUV$ and $u$ bands. After filling in the missing values, the quality of photo-$z$ estimation obtained by the widely used Easy and Accurate Zphot from Yale (EAZY) software is notably enhanced. Evaluation metrics for assessing the quality of photo-$z$ estimation, including the catastrophic outlier fraction ($f_{out}$), the normalized median absolute deviation ($\rm {\sigma_{NMAD}}$), and the bias of photometric redshift ($bias$), all show some degree of improvement. Our research will help maximize the utilization of observational data and provide a new method for handling sample missing values for applications that require complete photometry data to produce results.

          UV Cooling via O VI Emission in the Superwind of M82 Observed with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE)

 - **Abstract**
 We examined archival Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer data to search for far-ultraviolet emission lines in the starburst galaxy M82. The observations were made in an outflow region that extends beyond the galactic disk. We found the O VI $\lambda\lambda$ 1032, 1038 emission lines from the galaxy's southern outflow region. The O VI lines suggest that the outflowing warm-hot gas is undergoing radiative cooling. We measured a radial velocity of $\sim$420 km s$^{-1}$ from the O VI lines, which is faster than the velocity seen in H$\alpha$ observations. The O VI $\lambda$1038 emission line seems to be blended with the C II $\lambda$1037 emission line, which has a radial velocity of $\sim$300 km s$^{-1}$, similar to what is observed in H$\alpha$ observations. The outflow medium of M82 appears to be composed of gas in multiple phases with varying temperatures and kinematics. Future spectroscopic observations in high energy regimes covering a wider spatial area are necessary to understand better the properties of the warm-hot gas medium in the outflow.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of gravitational wave (GW) predictions from five two-dimensional Core Collapse Supernova (CCSN) simulations that varied only in the Equation of State (EOS) implemented. The GW signals from these simulations are used to produce spectrograms in the absence of noise, and the emergent high-frequency feature (HFF) is found to differ quantitatively between simulations. Below 1 kHz, the HFF is well approximated by a first-order polynomial in time. The resulting slope was found to vary between 10-50% across all models. Further, using real interferometric noise we investigated the current capabilities of GW detectors to resolve these differences in HFF slope for a Galactic CCSN. We find that for distances up to 1 kpc, current detectors can resolve HFF slopes that vary by at least 30%. For further Galactic distances, current detectors are capable of distinguishing the upper and lower bounds of the HFF slope for groupings of our models that varied in EOS. With the higher sensitivity of future GW detectors, and with improved analysis of the HFF, our ability to resolve properties of the HFF will improve for all Galactic distances. This study shows the potential of using the HFF of CCSN produced GWs to provide insight into the physical processes occurring deep within CCSN during collapse, and in particular its potential to further constrain the EOS through GW detection.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The carbamoyl radical (H2NCO) is believed to play a central role in the ice-grain chemistry of crucial interstellar complex organic molecules as formamide and acetamide. Yet, little is known about this radical that remains elusive in laboratory gas-phase experiments. Aims. In order to enable interstellar searches of H2NCO, we have undertaken a mandatory laboratory characterisation of its pure rotational spectrum. Methods. We report the gas-phase laboratory detection of H2NCO, produced by H-atom abstraction from formamide, using pure rotational spectroscopy at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths. Millimetre-wave data were acquired using chirped-pulse Fourier-transform spectroscopy while submillimetre-wave ones were obtained using Zeeman-modulated spectroscopy. Experimental measurements were guided by quantum-chemical calculations at the $\omega$B97X-D/cc-pVQZ level of theory. Interstellar searches for the radical have been undertaken on the Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey (PILS) towards the solar-type protostar IRAS 16293-2422. Results. From the assignment and fit of experimental transitions up to 660 GHz, reliable spectroscopic parameters for H2NCO in its ground vibrational state have been derived, enabling accurate spectral predictions. No transitions of the radical were detected on the PILS survey. The inferred upper limit shows that H2NCO abundance is at least 60 times below that of formamide and 160 times below that of HNCO in this source; a value that is in agreement with predictions from a physico-chemical model of this young protostar.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of transient phenomena, such as GRBs, FRBs, novae/supernovae explosions, coupled with the detection of cosmic messengers like high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves, have transformed astrophysics. Maximizing the discovery potential necessitates tools for swiftly acquiring an overview of the most relevant information for each new detection. Introducing Astro-COLIBRI, a comprehensive platform designed to meet this challenge. Astro-COLIBRI features a public API, real-time databases and alert systems, a discussion forum, and a website and iOS/Android apps as user clients. In real time, it evaluates incoming astronomical observation messages from all available alert streams, filters them based on user-defined criteria, and contextualizes them in the multi-wavelength (MWL) and multi-messenger (MM) context. User clients offer a graphical representation, providing a succinct summary for quick identification of interesting phenomena and assessing observing conditions globally.

 - **Abstract**
 The Simons Observatory is a new ground-based cosmic microwave background experiment, which is currently being commissioned in Chile's Atacama Desert. During its survey, the observatory's small aperture telescopes will map 10% of the sky in bands centered at frequencies ranging from 27 to 280 GHz to constrain cosmic inflation models, and its large aperture telescope will map 40% of the sky in the same bands to constrain cosmological parameters and use weak lensing to study large-scale structure. To achieve these science goals, the Simons Observatory is deploying these telescopes' receivers with 60,000 state-of-the-art superconducting transition-edge sensor bolometers for its first five year survey. Reading out this unprecedented number of cryogenic sensors, however, required the development of a novel readout system. The SMuRF electronics were developed to enable high-density readout of superconducting sensors using cryogenic microwave SQUID multiplexing technology. The commissioning of the SMuRF systems at the Simons Observatory is the largest deployment to date of microwave multiplexing technology for transition-edge sensors. In this paper, we show that a significant fraction of the systems deployed so far to the Simons Observatory's large aperture telescope meet baseline specifications for detector yield and readout noise in this early phase of commissioning.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the envelope composition of sub-Neptune-type exoplanets is challenging due to the inherent degeneracy in their interior composition scenarios. Particularly, the H2O/H2 ratio, or can be expressed as the O/H ratio, in the planetary envelope provides crucial insights into the origin of these exoplanets relative to the ice line during formation. Using self-consistent radiative transfer modeling and a rate-based automatic chemical network generator combined with 1D photochemical kinetic-transport atmospheric modeling, we investigate atmospheres of temperate sub-Neptunes, ranging from H2-dominated to H2O-dominated scenarios with Teq = 250-400 K, using K2-18 b (Teq = 255 K), LP 791-18 c (Teq = 324 K), and TOI-270 d (Teq = 354 K) as examples. Our models indicate that using the atmospheric CO2/CH4 ratio to infer the deep-interior H2O/H2 ratio. Applying to recent JWST observations, our findings suggest K2-18 b likely has an interior highly enriched in water (approximately 50% H2O), exceeding the amount of water in a 100x solar metallicity scenario and suggesting a formation history that involved substantial accretion of ices. In contrast, TOI-270 d has an interior composition of approximately 25% H2O, which is comparable to the conventional metallicity framework with a metallicity higher than 100x solar metallicity. Furthermore, our models identify carbonyl sulfide (OCS) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) as strong indicators of at least a 10% water-rich envelope in temperate sub-Neptunes. These results provide a method to delineate the internal composition and formation mechanisms of sub-Neptunes with Teq< ~500 K via atmospheric characterization through transmission spectroscopy.

 - **Abstract**
 T CrB is a symbiotic star that experiences nova outbursts every $\sim$ 80~yr. The next, long-anticipated nova outburst should occur during the 2024-2026 period. Here, we present results of high-resolution optical spectroscopy of T CrB in the period 2016 - 2023. In these spectra, we measured the equivalent widths of the H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, HeI and HeII emission lines. The maximum equivalent width (EW) was recorded on May 2021, when the EW of $H\alpha$ reached -44.6 Åand H$\beta$ = -21.5 Å. At the other extreme, the minimum of EW($H\alpha$)= -2.9 Åwas recorded in October 2023. After October 2023, the B-band emission brightened, suggesting a re-appearance of the orbital modulation. In addition to the optical data, we study the X-ray behaviour in the same period. We find a strong correlation between $EW(H\alpha)$ and X-ray flux with a correlation coefficient -0.78 and a significance of 2.6$\times 10^{-5}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrumnet (DESI) collaboration recently released the first year data of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). Basing on the five different tracers, the cosmological constraint shows a hint of deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In this letter, We combine the DESI BAOs with other cosmic probes to constrain the evolution of Hubble constant as a function of redshift in flat $\Lambda$CDM model. The non-parametric method is used to estimate the value of Hubble constant at different redshift bins. The correlation among different bins are removed by diagonalizing the covariance matrix. The joint data sample demonstrate a decreasing trend of Hubble constant with a significance of $8.6 \sigma$, which can naturally resolve the Hubble tension. It may be due to dynamical dark energy or modified gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) with neutron stars show quite different features which depend on the rate of mass transfer from the donor star. With a high transfer rate the Z sources are in a persistent soft spectral state, with a moderate rate the transient Atoll sources have outburst cycles like the black hole X-ray binaries. The observations document very long outburst recurrence times for quite a number of sources. We follow with our computations the evolution of the accretion disc until the onset of the ionization instability. For sources with a low mass transfer rate the accumulation of matter in the disc is essentially reduced due to the continuous evaporation of matter from the disc to the coronal flow. Different mass transfer rates result in nearly the same amount of matter accumulated for the outburst which means the outburst properties are similar for sources with short and sources with long outburst cycles, contrary to some expectations. Then of systems with long recurrence time less sources will be detected and the total population of LMXBs could be larger than it appears. This would relieve the apparent problem that the observed number of LMXBs as progenitors of millisecond pulsars (MSP) is too small compared to the number of MSP. Concerning the few quasi-persistent sources with year-long soft states we argue that these states are not outbursts, but quasi-stationary hot states as in Z sources.

          A New Puzzling Periodic Signal in GeV Energies of the $\gamma$-Ray Binary LS I +61$^\circ$303

 - **Abstract**
 LS I + 61$^\circ$303 is a high-mass X-ray binary system comprising a massive Be star and a rapidly rotating neutron star. Its spectral energy distribution across multi-wavelengths categorizes it as a $\gamma$-ray binary system. In our analysis of LS I + 61$^\circ$303 using Fermi-LAT observations, we not only confirmed the three previously discussed periodicities of orbital, superorbital, and orbital-superorbital beat periods observed in multi-wavelength observations, but also identified an additional periodic signal. This newly discovered signal exhibits a period of $\sim$26.3 day at a $\sim7\sigma$ confidence level. Moreover, the power spectrum peak of the new signal gradually decreases as the energy increases across the energy ranges of 0.1-0.3, 0.3-1.0, and 1.0-500.0 GeV. Interestingly, a potential signal with a similar period was found in data obtained from the Owens Valley Radio Observatory 40 m telescope. We suggest that the newly discovered periodic signal may originate from a coupling between the orbital period and the retrograde stellar precession period.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) cosmology relies on the estimation of lightcurve parameters to derive precision distances that leads to the estimation of cosmological parameters. The empirical SALT2 lightcurve modeling that relies on only two parameters, a stretch x1, and a color c, has been used by the community for almost two decades. In this paper we study the ability of the SALT2 model to fit the nearly 3000 cosmology-grade SN Ia lightcurves from the second release of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) cosmology science working group. While the ZTF data was not used to train SALT2, the algorithm is modeling the ZTF SN Ia optical lightcurves remarkably well, except for lightcurve points prior to -10 d from maximum, where the training critically lacks statistics. We find that the lightcurve fitting is robust against the considered choice of phase-range, but we show the [-10; +40] d range to be optimal in terms of statistics and accuracy. We do not detect any significant features in the lightcurve fit residuals that could be connected to the host environment. Potential systematic population differences related to the SN Ia host properties might thus not be accountable for by the addition of extra lightcurve parameters. However, a small but significant inconsistency between residuals of blue- and red-SN Ia strongly suggests the existence of a phase-dependent color term, with potential implications for the use of SNe Ia in precision cosmology. We thus encourage modellers to explore this avenue and we emphasize the importance that SN Ia cosmology must include a SALT2 retraining to accurately model the lightcurves and avoid biasing the derivation of cosmological parameters.

          Spectral line fluorescence in moving envelopes of stars

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of optical fluorescent lines in moving media has not yet been studied in detail, so this work represents a first step in investigating the fluorescence process in different types of macroscopic velocity fields: (a) accelerated outflows, (b) accelerated infalls, and (c) non-monotonic velocity fields (such as an accelerating outflow followed by a deceleration region or an accretion shock front). We solve the radiative transfer equations for the lines involved in the fluorescent process, assuming spherical symmetry and a simplified atomic model. We use the framework of the generalized Sobolev theory for computing the interacting, non-local source functions. The emergent line fluxes are then integrated exactly. Because of Doppler shifts in the moving gaseous envelope, photons of the three lines involved in TTS FeI fluorescence CaII H, FeI 3969, and H_epsilon interact with each other in a complex way, so that fluorescent amplification of the line flux occurs not only for FeI 3969, but also for the other two lines, in all velocity fields that we investigated. With the assumption of LTE populations, the line source functions of moderately optically thick lines are not strongly affected by line interactions, while they are depressed in the inner envelope for optically thick lines because of stellar photon absorption in the interaction regions. Fluorescent amplification takes place mainly in the observer's reference frame during the flux integration. Further comparison with observations will require solving the rate equations for the atomic populations involved, along with the radiation field computed with the method presented here. The main product of this research is the open-source computer code SLIM2 (Spectral Line Interactions in Moving Media), written in Python/Numpy, which numerically solves the fluorescence problem for arbitrary 2D velocities.

          Quantum Statistical Effects on Warm Dark Matter and the Mass Constraint from the Cosmic Large Scale Structure

 - **Abstract**
 The suppression of small-scale matter power spectrum is a distinct feature of Warm Dark Matter (WDM), which permits a constraint on the WDM mass from galaxy surveys. In the thermal relic WDM scenario, quantum statistical effects are not manifest. In a unified framework, we investigate the quantum statistical effects for a fermion case with a degenerate pressure and a boson case with a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). Compared to the thermal relic case, the degenerate fermion case only slightly lowers the mass bound while the boson case with a high initial BEC fraction ($\gtrsim90\%$) significantly lowers it. On the other hand, the BEC fraction drops during the relativistic-to-nonrelativistic transition and completely disappears if the initial fraction is below $\sim64\%$. Given the rising interest in resolving the late-time galaxy-scale problems with boson condensation, a question is posed on how a high initial BEC fraction can be dynamically created so that a DM condensed component remains today.

 $Context.$ On October 31, 2009, the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) on board the Herschel Space Observatory observed far-infrared spectra of Jupiter between 50 and 220$\,\mu$m as part of the program "Water and Related Chemistry in the Solar System". $Aims.$ We investigate the disk-averaged chemical composition of Jupiter's atmosphere as a function of height using these observations. $Methods.$ We used the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) and the least-squares fitting technique to infer the abundances of trace constituents. $Results.$ The PACS data include numerous spectral lines attributable to ammonia (NH$_3$), methane (CH$_4$), phosphine (PH$_3$), water (H$_2$O), and deuterated hydrogen (HD) in the Jovian atmosphere. We infer an ammonia abundance profile that decreases from a mole fraction of $(1.7\pm 0.8)\times 10^{-4}$ at $p\sim 900\,$mbar to $(1.7\pm 0.9)\times 10^{-8}$ at $p\sim 275\,$mbar, following a fractional scale height of about 0.114. For phosphine, we find a mole fraction of $(7.2\pm 1.2)\times 10^{-7}$ at pressures higher than $(550\pm 100)\,$mbar and a decrease of its abundance at lower pressures following a fractional scale height of $(0.09\pm 0.02)$. Our analysis delivers a methane mole fraction of $(1.49\pm 0.09)\times 10^{-3}$. Analyzing the HD $R(0)$ line at $112.1\,\mu$m yields a new measurement of Jupiter's D/H ratio, $\text{D/H}=(1.5\pm 0.6)\times 10^{-5}$. Finally, the PACS data allow us to put the most stringent $3\sigma$ upper limits yet on the mole fractions of hydrogen halides in the Jovian troposphere. These new upper limits are $<1.1\times 10^{-11}$ for hydrogen fluoride (HF), $<6.0\times 10^{-11}$ for hydrogen chloride (HCl), $<2.3\times 10^{-10}$ for hydrogen bromide (HBr) and $<1.2\times 10^{-9}$ for hydrogen iodide (HI) and support the proposed condensation of hydrogen halides into ammonium halide salts in the Jovian troposphere.

 - **Abstract**
 General circulation models are a useful tool in understanding the three dimensional structure of hot Jupiter and sub-Neptune atmospheres; however, understanding the validity of the results from these simulations requires an understanding the artificial dissipation required for numerical stability. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the longitudinal filter and vertical ``sponge'' used in the Met Office's {\sc Unified Model} when simulating gaseous exoplanets. We demonstrate that excessive dissipation can result in counter-rotating jets and a catastrophic failure to conserve angular momentum. Once the dissipation is reduced to a level where a super-rotating jet forms, however, the jet and thermal structure are relatively insensitive to the dissipation, except in the nightside gyres where temperatures can vary by $\sim 100\,\mathrm{K}$. We do find, however, that flattening the latitudinal profile of the longitudinal filtering alters the results more than a reduction in the strength of the filtering itself. We also show that even in situations where the temperatures are relatively insensitive to the dissipation, the vertical velocities can still vary with the dissipation, potentially impacting physical processes that depend on the local vertical transport.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. Our aim is to test how different binning strategies previously studied in one-dimensional models perform in three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamic simulations of stellar atmospheres. Methods. Realistic box-in-a-star simulations of the near-surface convection and photosphere of three spectral types (G2V, K0V, and M2V) were run with the MANCHA code with grey opacity. After reaching the stationary state, one snapshot of each of the three stellar simulations was used to compute the radiative energy exchange rate with grey opacity, opacity binned in four $\tau$-bins, and opacity binned in 18 $\{ \tau, \lambda \}$-bins. These rates were compared with the ones computed with opacity distribution functions. Then, stellar simulations were run with grey, four-bin, and 18-bin opacities to see the impact of the opacity setup on the mean stratification of the temperature and its gradient after time evolution. Results. The simulations of main sequence cool stars with the MANCHA code are consistent with those in the literature. For the three stars, the radiative energy exchange rates computed with 18 bins are remarkably close to the ones computed with the opacity distribution functions. The rates computed with four bins are similar to the rates computed with 18 bins, and present a significant improvement with respect to the rates computed with the Rosseland opacity, especially above the stellar surface. The Rosseland mean can reproduce the proper rates in sub-surface layers, but produces large errors for the atmospheric layers of the G2V and K0V stars. In the case of the M2V star, the Rosseland mean fails even in sub-surface layers, owing to the importance of the contribution from molecular lines in the opacity, underestimated by the harmonic mean. Similar conclusions are reached studying the mean stratification of the temperature and its gradient after time evolution.

          From Chromospheric Evaporation to Coronal Rain: An Investigation of the Mass and Energy Cycle of a Flare

 - **Abstract**
 Chromospheric evaporation (CE) and coronal rain (CR) represent two crucial phenomena encompassing the circulation of mass and energy during solar flares. While CE marks the start of the hot inflow into the flaring loop, CR marks the end, indicating the outflow in the form of cool and dense condensations. With \textit{IRIS} and \textit{AIA/SDO}, we examine and compare the evolution, dynamics, morphology, and energetics of the CR and CE during a C2.1 flare. The CE is directly observed in imaging and spectra in the \ion{Fe}{XXI} line with \textit{IRIS} and in the \ion{Fe}{XVIII} line of AIA, with upward average total speeds of $138\pm[35]~$km~s$^{-1}$ and a temperature of $[9.03\pm3.28]\times10^{6}$~K. An explosive to gentle CE transition is observed, with an apparent reduction in turbulence. From quiescent to gradual flare phase, the amount and density of CR increases by a factor of $\approx4.4$ and 6, respectively. The rain's velocity increases by a 1.4, in agreement with gas pressure drag. In contrast, the clump widths variation is negligible. The location and morphology of CE match closely those of the rain showers, with similar CE sub-structure to the rain strands, reflecting fundamental scales of mass and energy transport. We obtain a CR outflow mass three times larger than the CE inflow mass, suggesting the presence of unresolved CE, perhaps at higher temperatures. The CR energy corresponds to half that of the CE. These results suggest an essential role of coronal rain in the mass-energy cycle of a flare.

 - **Abstract**
 The signal from a transiting planet can be diluted by astrophysical contamination. In the case of circumstellar debris disks, this contamination could start in the mid-infrared and vary as a function of wavelength, which would then change the observed transmission spectrum for any planet in the system. The MIRI/LRS WASP-39b transmission spectrum shows an unexplained dip starting at $\sim$10 $\mu$m that could be caused by astrophysical contamination. The spectral energy distribution displays excess flux at similar levels to that which are needed to create the dip in the transmission spectrum. In this article, we show that this dip is consistent with the presence of a bright circumstellar debris disk, at a distance of $>$2 au. We discuss how a circumstellar debris disk like that could affect the atmosphere of WASP-39b. We also show that even faint debris disks can be a source of contamination in MIRI exoplanet spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 With the recent announcement by NASA's Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032, a priority flagship mission to the planet Uranus is anticipated. Here, we explore the prospects of using the mission's radio Doppler tracking equipment to detect gravitational waves (GWs) and other analogous signals related to dark matter (DM) over the duration of its interplanetary cruise. By employing a methodology to stack tracking data in combination with Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain parameter recovery tests, we show that the mission will be sensitive to GWs over the wide frequency range of $3\times 10^{-9}$ Hz to $10^{-1}$ Hz, provided that tracking data is taken consistently over a large fraction of the cruise duration. Thus, the mission has the potential to fill the gap between pulsar timing and space-based-interferometry GW observatories. Within this assumption, we forecast the detection of $\mathcal{\mathcal{O}}(1 - 100)$ individual massive black hole binaries using two independent population models. Additionally, we determine the mission's sensitivity to both astrophysical and primordial stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, as well as its capacity to test, or even confirm via detection, ultralight DM models. In all these cases, the tracking of the spacecraft over its interplanetary cruise would enable coverage of unexplored regions of parameter space, where signals from new phenomena in our Universe may be lurking.

 Time-domain astrophysics continues to grow rapidly, with the inception of new surveys drastically increasing data volumes. Democratised, distributed approaches to training sets for machine learning classifiers are crucial to make the most of this torrent of discovery -- with citizen science approaches proving effective at meeting these requirements. In this paper, we describe the creation of and the initial results from the $\textit{Kilonova Seekers}$ citizen science project, built to find transient phenomena from the GOTO telescopes in near real-time. $\textit{Kilonova Seekers}$ launched in July 2023 and received over 600,000 classifications from approximately 2,000 volunteers over the course of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4a observing run. During this time, the project has yielded 20 discoveries, generated a `gold-standard' training set of 17,682 detections for augmenting deep-learned classifiers, and measured the performance and biases of Zooniverse volunteers on real-bogus classification. This project will continue throughout the lifetime of GOTO, pushing candidates at ever-greater cadence, and directly facilitate the next-generation classification algorithms currently in development.

 In previous works, we have investigated the star-forming region G29.96$-$0.02 where the massive young stellar object (MYSO) G29.862$-$0.0044 (hereafter G29) is embedded in a hot molecular core. In one of them, of multiwavelength nature, using data from the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE), data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), and photometric data from NIRI-Gemini, G29 was investigated at different spatial scales. However, the intriguing morphology of G29 in the near-infrared, together with the distribution of the associated molecular gas, reveals that the star-formation scenario is far from being understood. This work incorporates the analysis of the emission of several molecular lines acquired with ALMA that were not previously examined (eg.,~CH$_{3}$OH, HC$_{3}$N, H$_{ 2}$CO, C$^{34}$S, H$_{2}$CS) as well as a new determination of the temperature of the region. Additionally, we present the progress of results obtained through new observations in the near-infrared, in this case spectroscopic, using NIFS-Gemini, and in radio continnum obtained with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA). This research allows us to carry out a detailed chemical study of the region, which will contribute to the understanding of the physical processes involved in the high-mass star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Third generation ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will operate in the $(\text{few}-10^4)$ Hz frequency band, with a boost in sensitivity providing an unprecedented reach into primordial cosmology. Working concurrently with pulsar timing arrays in the nHz band, and LISA in the mHz band, these 3G detectors will be powerful probes of beyond the standard model particle physics on scales $T\gtrsim 10^{7}$GeV. Here we focus on their ability to probe phase transitions (PTs) in the early universe. We first overview the landscape of detectors across frequencies, discuss the relevance of astrophysical foregrounds, and provide convenient and up-to-date power-law integrated sensitivity curves for these detectors. We then present the constraints expected from GW observations on first order PTs and on topological defects (strings and domain walls), which may be formed when a symmetry is broken irrespective of the order of the phase transition. These constraints can then be applied to specific models leading to first order PTs and/or topological defects. In particular we discuss the implications for axion models, which solve the strong CP problem by introducing a spontaneously broken Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry. For post-inflationary breaking, the PQ scale must lie in the $10^{8}-10^{11}$ GeV range, and so the signal from a first order PQ PT falls within reach of ground based 3G detectors. A scan in parameter space of signal-to-noise ratio in a representative model reveals their large potential to probe the nature of the PQ transition. Additionally, in heavy axion type models domain walls form, which can lead to a detectable GW background. We discuss their spectrum and summarise the expected constraints on these models from 3G detectors, together with SKA and LISA.

 - **Abstract**
 The Wide-Field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) is a concept for a 12-m class seeing-limited telescope providing two concentric fields of view for simultaneous Multi-Object Spectroscopy and Integral Field Spectroscopy. The specified wavelength range is 0.35-1.6 microns. The baseline optical design relies on a corrected Cassegrain solution feeding Multi-Object spectrographs through fibres, while the central area of the field is propagated down to a gravity-stable Integral Field Station housing 144 spectrographs. The Cassegrain corrector also provides for atmospheric dispersion compensation. All optical components are within commercially available dimensions. With a view to minimizing risks and costs, to the maximum possible extent the telescope relies on proven subsystem solutions. An exception is the tip-tilt secondary mirror, which would likely have to provide some rejection of wind shake. An iteration of the optical design is ongoing, with a view to mitigating the weaknesses of the first baseline design. The telescope would be wavefront-controlled on-sky at the common-path MOS focus. Controls in the IFS path will need to compensate for the effect of subsequent differentials - wavefront and line of sight. There is no shortage of degrees of freedom and metrology solution to do so. The size of the dome is driven by the Nasmyth footprint and the height of the pier, which houses the IFS station. The baseline assumption is that a VLT-like enclosure would provide suitable shielding and ventilation.

          The impact of asteroseismically calibrated internal mixing on nucleosynthetic wind yields of massive stars

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismology gives us the opportunity to look inside stars and determine their internal properties. Based on these observations, estimations can be made for the amount of the convective boundary mixing and envelope mixing of such stars, and the shape of the mixing profile in the envelope. However, these results are not typically included in stellar evolution models. We aim to investigate the impact of varying convective boundary mixing and envelope mixing in a range based on asteroseismic modelling in stellar models, both for the stellar structure and for the nucleosynthetic yields. In this first study, we focus on the pre-explosive evolution of a 20Msun star and evolve the models to the final phases of carbon burning. We vary the convective boundary mixing, implemented as step-overshoot, with the overshoot parameter in the range 0.05-0.4 and the amount of envelope mixing in the range 1-10$^{6}$ with a mixing profile based on internal gravity waves. We use a large nuclear network of 212 isotopes to study the nucleosynthesis. We find that enhanced mixing according to asteroseismology of main-sequence stars, both at the convective core boundary and in the envelope, has significant effects on the nucleosynthetic wind yields. Our evolutionary models beyond the main sequence diverge in yields from models based on rotational mixing, having longer helium burning lifetimes and lighter helium-depleted cores. We find that the asteroseismic ranges of internal mixing calibrated from core hydrogen burning stars lead to similar wind yields as those resulting from the theory of rotational mixing. Adopting the seismic mixing levels beyond the main sequence, we find earlier transitions to radiative carbon burning compared to models based on rotational mixing. This influences the compactness and the occurrence of shell-mergers, which may affect the supernova properties and explosive nucleosynthesis.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21cm line of neutral hydrogen is a powerful probe of the high-redshift universe (Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization), with an unprecedented potential to inform us about key processes of early galaxy formation, the first stars and even cosmology and structure formation, via intensity mapping. It is the subject of a number of current and upcoming low-frequency radio experiments. This paper presents 21cmSense v2.0, which is a Python package that provides a modular framework for calculating the sensitivity of these experiments, in order to enhance the process of their design and forecasting their power for parameter inference. Version 2.0 of 21cmSense has been re-written from the ground up to be more modular and extensible than its venerable predecessor (Pober et al., 2013, 2014), and to provide a more user-friendly interface. The package is freely available both to use and contribute towards at this https URL.

          Towards an optimal marked correlation function analysis for the detection of modified gravity

 - **Abstract**
 Modified gravity (MG) theories have emerged as a promising alternative to explain the late-time acceleration of the Universe. However, the detection of MG in observations of the large-scale structure remains challenging due to the screening mechanisms that obscure any deviations from General Relativity (GR) in high-density regions. The marked two-point correlation function offers a promising approach to potentially detect MG signals. This work investigates novel marks based on large-scale environment estimates but also that exploit the anti-correlation between objects in low- and high-density regions. This is the first time discreteness effects in density-dependent marked correlation functions are investigated in depth. We assess the performance of various marks to distinguish GR from MG by using the ELEPHANT simulations, comprised of realisations of GR as well as $f(R)$ and nDGP gravity. In addition, discreteness effects are studied using the high-density Covmos catalogues. We establish a robust method to correct for shot-noise effects that allows the recovery of the true signal with an accuracy below $5\%$ over a wide range of scales. We find such correction to be crucial to measure the amplitude of the marked correlation function in an unbiased manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate that marks, anti-correlating objects in low- and high-density regions, are among the most effective in distinguishing between MG and GR. We report differences in the marked correlation function between $f(R)$ with $|f_{R0}|=10^{-6}$ and GR simulations of the order of 3-5$\sigma$ in real space up to scales of about $80\, h^{-1} \, {\rm Mpc}$. The redshift-space monopole exhibits similar features and performances. The combination of the proposed $\tanh$-mark with shot-noise correction paves the way towards an optimal approach for the detection of MG in current and future galaxy spectroscopic surveys.

          Hybrid inflation and gravitational waves from accidentally light scalars

 - **Abstract**
 We construct a hybrid-inflation model where the inflaton potential is generated radiatively, as gauge symmetries guarantee it to be accidentally flat at tree level. The model can be regarded as a small-field version of Natural Inflation, with inflation ending when the mass of a second scalar, the waterfall field, turns tachyonic. This provides a minimal, robust realisation of hybrid inflation, which predicts specific correlations among CMB observables. Tachyonic preheating leads to the production of gravitational waves which, for a low inflationary scale, might be detected by upcoming experiments. Simple variations of the model can give rise to topological defects, such as unstable domain walls. Their dynamics produces a stochastic gravitational-wave background, which can be compatible with the recent detection by pulsar timing arrays.
