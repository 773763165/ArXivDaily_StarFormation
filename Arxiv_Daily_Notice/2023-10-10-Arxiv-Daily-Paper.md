 - **Abstract**
 This is the second paper in a series, which studies the likelihood that some globular clusters (GCs) of the Milky Way (MW) could have originated from a dwarf satellite galaxy (DSG). Using a large suite of three-body simulations we determine the present-day orbital properties of 154 GCs that could have escaped from 41 MW DSGs over the past $8\,\mathrm{Gyrs}$. For the MW we considered two sets of static and dynamic models which account for the sustained growth of the MW since its birth. We focus on the Magellanic Clouds and Sagittarius. We compare the apogalactic distance, eccentricity, and orbital inclination of the MW GCs with those of runaway GCs from DSGs, to constrain their possible ex-situ origin. We observe a positive correlation between a DSG mass and the dispersion of its runaway GCs in the orbital parameter space of ($R_\mathrm{ap}$, $e$). We provide tables of the identified MW GCs and their likely associated progenitors. In total, we find 29 (19%) MW GCs which could be kinematically associated with MW DSGs. We report, for the first time, 6 and 10 new associations with the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Sagittarius, respectively. For the Sagittarius we predict a concentration of runaway GCs at large apogalactic distances of $R_\mathrm{ap}\approx275-375\,\mathrm{kpc}$, $e\approx0.8$, and a relative inclination of $\Delta\theta\approx20^{\circ}$. So far, there has not been any observed GCs with such orbital elements. Complemented with photometric and spectroscopic observations, and cosmological simulations, the findings from the present study could conclusively settle the debate over the in-situ vs. ex-situ origin of the MW GCs.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of PSJ2107-1611, a fold-configuration 4.3"-separation quadruply lensed quasar with a bright lensed arc. It was discovered using a convolutional neural network on Pan-STARRS gri images of pre-selected quasar candidates with multiple nearby Pan-STARRS detections. Spectroscopic follow-up with EFOSC2 on the ESO 3.58m New Technology Telescope reveals the source to be a quasar at z = 2.673, with the blended fold image pair showing deformed broad lines relative to the other images. The flux ratios measured from optical to near-infrared imaging in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, Pan-STARRS, the Legacy Surveys, and the Vista Hemisphere Survey are inconsistent with a smooth mass model as the fold pair images are about 15 times too faint. Variability, time delay effects, and reddening are ruled out through multiple-epoch imaging and color information. The system is marginally resolved in the radio in the Very Large Array Sky Survey S-band, where it has a 10 mJy detection. The radio flux ratios are compatible with the smooth mass macromodel. This system offers a unique tool for future studies of quasar structure with strong and microlensing. A more detailed analysis of follow-up with JWST/MIRI, VLT/MUSE, VLT/ERIS, and data from the European Very Long Baseline Interferometer will be presented in an upcoming paper.
#### Robust cosmological inference from non-linear scales with k-th nearest  neighbor statistics

 - **Abstract**
 We present the methodology for deriving accurate and reliable cosmological constraints from non-linear scales (<50Mpc/h) with k-th nearest neighbor (kNN) statistics. We detail our methods for choosing robust minimum scale cuts and validating galaxy-halo connection models. Using cross-validation, we identify the galaxy-halo model that ensures both good fits and unbiased predictions across diverse summary statistics. We demonstrate that we can model kNNs effectively down to transverse scales of rp ~ 3Mpc/h and achieve precise and unbiased constraints on the matter density and clustering amplitude, leading to a 2% constraint on sigma_8. Our simulation-based model pipeline is resilient to varied model systematics, spanning simulation codes, halo finding, and cosmology priors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through an application to the Beyond-2p mock challenge. We propose further explorations to test more complex galaxy-halo connection models and tackle potential observational systematics.

 - **Abstract**
 The analysis of the mid-infrared spectra helps understanding the composition of the gas in the inner, dense and warm terrestrial planet forming region of disks around young stars. ALMA has detected hydrocarbons in the outer regions of the planet forming disk and Spitzer detected \ce{C2H2} in the inner regions. JWST- MIRI provides high spectral resolution observations of \ce{C2H2} and a suite of more complex hydrocarbons are now reported. Interpreting the fluxes observed in the spectra is challenging and radiation thermo-chemical codes are needed to properly take into account the disk structure, radiative transfer, chemistry and thermal balance. Various disk physical parameters like the gas-to-dust ratio, dust evolution including radial drift, dust growth and settling can affect the fluxes observed in the mid-IR. Still, thermo-chemical disk models were not always successful in matching all observed molecular emission bands simultaneously. The goal of this project is two-fold. We analyse the warm carbon chemistry in the inner regions of the disk, i.e. within 10 au to find pathways forming \ce{C2H2} potentially missing from the existing chemical networks. Second, we analyse the effect of the new chemistry on the line fluxes of acetylene. We use radiative thermo-chemical disk code {P{\small RO}D{\small I}M{\small O}} to expand the hydrocarbon chemistry that occurs in a typical standard T Tauri disks. We used the UMIST and the KIDA rate databases for collecting reactions for the species. We include a number of three-body and thermal decomposition reactions from STAND2020 network. We included isotopomers for the species that were present in the databases. The chemistry is then analysed in the regions that produce observable features in the mid-infrared spectra. The effect of expanding the hydrocarbon chemistry on the mid-infrared spectra is studied. Acetylene is formed via two ....

 - **Abstract**
 A quasi-nonlinear field theory which describes how to take ensemble averages that are unique to the Collisionless Boltzmann Equation is described. The assumption that the ensemble average of the distribution function is equal to the extremum entropy state, $\langle f \rangle = f_0$ is taken apart and shown to be wrong. An application describes the nonlinear saturation of Jeans' instability, and the gravitational amplification of Poisson noise.

 - **Abstract**
 G106.3$+$2.7, commonly considered a composite supernova remnant (SNR), is characterized by a boomerang-shaped pulsar wind nebula (PWN) and two distinct ("head" & "tail") regions in the radio band. A discovery of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission ($E_\gamma > 100$ GeV) followed by the recent detection of ultra-high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray emission ($E_\gamma > 100$ TeV) from the tail region suggests that G106.3$+$2.7 is a PeVatron candidate. We present a comprehensive multi-wavelength study of the Boomerang PWN (100" around PSR J2229+6114) using archival radio and Chandra data obtained from two decades ago, a new NuSTAR X-ray observation from 2020, and upper limits on gamma-ray fluxes obtained by Fermi and VERITAS observatories. The NuSTAR observation allowed us to detect a 51.67 ms spin period from the pulsar PSR J2229+6114 and the PWN emission characterized by a power-law model with $\Gamma = 1.52\pm0.06$ up to 20 keV. Contrary to the previous radio study by Kothes et al. 2006, we prefer a much lower PWN B-field ($B\sim3$ $\mu$G) and larger distance ($d \sim 8$ kpc) based on (1) the non-varying X-ray flux over the last two decades, (2) the energy-dependent X-ray PWN size resulting from synchrotron burn-off and (3) the multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) data. Our SED model suggests that the PWN is currently re-expanding after being compressed by the SNR reverse shock $\sim 1000$ years ago. In this case, the head region should be formed by GeV--TeV electrons injected earlier by the pulsar propagating into the low density environment.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a collection of classified X-ray sources in Globular Clusters (GCs) observed by the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO), including active binaries, cataclysmic variables, millisecond pulsars, and low-mass X-ray binaries. We cross-match the most accurate published positions from multiwavelength observations of these sources to the Chandra Source Catalog (CSC) Release 2.1, and the HST UV Globular Cluster Survey (HUGS) to extract their multiwavelength properties. The dataset can be accessed via an interactive website and used as a training dataset for machine-learning classification of unidentified X-ray sources in GCs.

 - **Abstract**
 The orbital architectures of short-period exoplanet systems are shaped by tidal dissipation in their host stars. For low-mass M-dwarfs whose dynamical tidal response comprises a dense spectrum of inertial modes at low frequencies, resolving the frequency dependence of tidal dissipation is crucial to capturing the effect of tides on planetary orbits throughout the evolutionary stages of the host star. We use non-perturbative spectral methods to calculate the normal mode oscillations of a fully-convective M-dwarf modeled using realistic stellar profiles from MESA. We compute the dissipative tidal response composed of contributions from each mode as well as non-adiabatic coupling between the modes, which we find to be an essential component of the dissipative calculations. Using our results for dissipation, we then compute of the evolution of circular, coplanar planetary orbits under the influence of tides in the host star. We find that orbital migration driven by resonance locking affects the orbits of Earth-mass planets at orbital periods $P_{\rm orb} \lesssim 1.5$ day and of Jupiter-mass planets at $P_{\rm orb} \lesssim 2.5$ day. Due to resonantly-driven orbital decay and outward migration, we predict a dearth of small planets closer than $P_{\rm orb} \sim 1$ day and similarly sparse numbers of more massive planets out to $P_{\rm orb} \sim 3$ day.
#### Rapid Dust Growth During Hydrodynamic Clumping Due to Streaming  Instability

 - **Abstract**
 Streaming instability is considered to be one of the dominant processes to promote planetesimal formation by gravitational collapse of dust clumps. The development of streaming instability is expected to form dust clumps in which the local dust density is strongly enhanced and even greater than the Roche density. The resulting clumps can collapse to form planetesimals. Recent simulations conducted long-term simulations and showed that such strong clumping occurs in a wider parameter space than previously expected. However, the indicated timescale for strong clumping can be on the order of tens to hundreds Keplerian periods. In this paper, we estimate the growth time of dust grains during the pre-clumping phase. We find that the dust growth considerably proceeds before the strong clumping because even the moderate clumping due to streaming instability increases the local dust-to-gas ratio $\gtrsim10$. Depending on the gas sound speed, the dust collision velocity can be kept below $\sim 1\;\mathrm{m/s}$ once sufficiently strong dust clumping occurs. Thus, even silicate grains might have the potential to grow safely toward the size whose Stokes number is unity during the clumping. Our results demonstrate the importance of local dust coagulation during the dust clumping due to streaming instability.

 - **Abstract**
 A multi-parameter analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of meteorological parameters, night sky brightness and seismic hazard on proposed sites for the new optical/infrared Egyptian astronomical telescope. The ERA5 reanalysis data set is used to get the following meteorological parameters: Total cloud coverage fraction, precipitable water vapor, relative humidity, wind speed & direction and Air temperature. To estimate the aerosol optical depth we used the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). Light pollution over the candidate sites was measured from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day Night Band (DNB). The seismic input in terms of maximum acceleration and response spectra were computed using a physics-based ground motion approach to assess the seismic hazards and consequently the designation of seismic resistant structure for the proposed sites to be able to assess the seismic hazards for the candidate sites. Of the seven nominated sites, two sites are found to have the best measurements and might be considered future sites for the new Egyptian Astronomical telescope. The first site is located in the south of the Sinai peninsula, while the second one is located in the Red Sea mountains region.

 - **Abstract**
 On 8 November 2013 a halo-type coronal mass ejection (CME) was observed, together with flares and type II radio bursts, but the association between the flares, radio bursts, and the CME was not clear. Our aim is to identify the origin of the CME and its direction of propagation, and to exclude features that were not connected to it. On the Earth-facing side, a GOES C5.7 class flare occurred close to the estimated CME launch time, followed by an X1.1 class flare. The latter flare was associated with an EUV wave and metric type II bursts. On the far side of the Sun, a filament eruption, EUV dimmings, and ejected CME loops were observed by imaging instruments onboard the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft that were viewing the backside of the Sun. The STEREO radio instruments observed an interplanetary (IP) type II radio burst at decameter-hectometric wavelengths, which was not observed by the radio instrument onboard the Wind spacecraft located at L1 near Earth. We show that the halo CME originated from the eruption on the far side of the Sun, and that the IP type II burst was created by a shock wave ahead of the halo CME. The radio burst remained unobserved from the earthside, even at heliocentric source heights larger than 9 solar radii. During the CME propagation, the X-class flare eruption caused a small plasmoid ejection earthward, the material of which was superposed on the earlier CME structures observed in projection. The estimated heights of the metric type II burst match well with the EUV wave launched by the X-class flare. As this radio emission did not continue to lower frequencies, we conclude that the shock wave did not propagate any further. Either the shock driver died out, as a blast wave, or the driver speed no longer exceeded the local Alfven speed.
#### Long-term hard X-ray variability properties of Swift-BAT blazars

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04952
 - **Abstract**
 We present results from the first dedicated study in the time domain of the hard X-ray variability behavior of blazars on long timescales based on $\sim$13 years of continuous hard X-ray data in the 14-195 keV band. We use monthly-binned data from the recent 157-month Swift-BAT catalog to characterize the hard X-ray variability of 127 blazars and search for potential differences between the variability of BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) and flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). A significant portion of the blazars in the sample ($\sim$37%) do not show statistically significant hard X-ray variability on monthly timescales, which is deeply at odds with previous studies that show that blazars are highly variable in the X-rays and other energy bands on a wide range of timescales. We also find that, on average, the FSRQs and BL Lacs for which we do detect variability exhibit similar flux variability; this suggests that the variability in these FSRQs is not necessarily driven by variations in the source function of scattered external radiation arriving from extended regions, and that it is instead possibly driven by processes that lead to variations in particle injection. In addition, only five blazars in our sample show significant spectral variability in the long-term light curves. For 3 blazars, we find that a power law that changes slope on monthly timescales is sufficient to characterize the variable hard X-ray spectrum, suggesting that, at least for some bright blazars, the long-term spectra in the hard X-rays may be described in a relatively simple fashion.
#### TREX: Kinematic Characterisation of a High-Dispersion Intermediate-Age  Stellar Component in M33

 - **Abstract**
 The dwarf galaxy Triangulum (M33) presents an interesting testbed for studying stellar halo formation: it is sufficiently massive so as to have likely accreted smaller satellites, but also lies within the regime where feedback and other "in-situ" formation mechanisms are expected to play a role. In this work, we analyse the line-of-sight kinematics of stars across M33 from the TREX survey with a view to understanding the origin of its halo. We split our sample into two broad populations of varying age, comprising 2032 "old" red giant branch (RGB) stars, and 671 "intermediate-age" asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and carbon stars. We find decisive evidence for two distinct kinematic components in both old and intermediate-age populations: a low-dispersion (~22 km/s) disk-like component co-rotating with M33's HI gas, and a significantly higher-dispersion component (~50-60 km/s) which does not rotate in the same plane as the gas and is thus interpreted as M33's stellar halo. While kinematically similar, the fraction of stars associated with the halo component differs significantly between the two populations: this is consistently ~10% for the intermediate age population, but decreases from ~34% to ~10% as a function of radius for the old population. We additionally find evidence that the intermediate-age halo population is systematically offset from the systemic velocity of M33 by ~25 km/s, with a preferred central LOS velocity of ~-155 km/s. This is the first detection and characterisation of an intermediate-age halo in M33, and suggests in-situ formation mechanisms, as well as potentially tidal interactions, have helped shaped it.
#### Universality of the Neutrino Collisional Flavor Instability in Core  Collapse Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos are known to undergo flavor conversion processes among the three flavors. The fast flavor conversion (FFC) has been the central piece of flavor conversions taking place in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) due to its shorter timescale to the completion of flavor conversion compared to other types of flavor conversion. Although the ordinary collisions between neutrinos and matter were once thought to decohere neutrinos and thus damp flavor conversions, it was recently realized that they can also induce the flavor conversion. The linear analysis showed that the so-called collisional flavor instability or CFI occurs in the absence of FFC. In this paper, we investigate if CFI takes place in of the post-bounce core of CCSNe, using the results of spherically symmetric Boltzmann simulations of CCSNe for four progenitor models with different masses. We also provide a necessary (but not sufficient) condition of matter properties for the occurrence of CFI in optically thick and semi-transparent regions; baryon mass density ($\rho$), electron fraction ($Y_e$), and the degeneracy of electron-type neutrinos ($\eta_{\nu_e}$) need to be $10^{10} {\rm g/cm^3} \lesssim \rho \lesssim 10^{12} {\rm g/cm^3}$, $Y_e\lesssim 0.4$, and $\eta_{\nu_e} \lesssim 0.5$, respectively. This condition allows us to easily locate the place of possible CFI occurence without detailed stability analyses, which is useful for analyzing CFI in CCSN models phenomenologically
#### Broad-line region in active galactic nuclei: dusty or dustless?

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The dust in the active galactic nuclei is clearly present right outside the broad-line region (BLR), in the form of a dusty molecular torus. However, some models of the BLR predict that dust may also exist within the BLR. Aims. We study the reprocessing of the radiation by the BLR with the aim to see how the presence of the dust affects the reprocessed continuum and the line properties. Methods. We calculate a range of models with the use of CLOUDY photoionization code for dusty and dustless plasma. We pay particular attention to the well-studied object NGC 5548, and we compare the line equivalent width predictions with the observed data for this object. Results. We obtain a rough agreement between the expected equivalent widths of the H\b{eta} and Mg II lines with observed values for NGC 5548 for the line distances implied by the time-delay measurement (for H\b{eta}) and by the radius-luminosity relation (for Mg II) when the medium is dusty. The incident radiation is then consistent with the radiation seen by the observer, no shielding between the inner disk and the BLR is required. High ionization lines like He II, however, form clearly in the inner dustless region. When the additional absorber is present, the H\b{eta} emitting region moves closer, to the dustless part of the accretion disk surface.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Transition blazars exhibit a shift from one subclass to another during different flux states, making their study crucial to understand the underlying physics of blazars. Aims. To probe the origin of multi-wavelength emission from the transition blazar B2 1308+326 using 14-year long gamma-ray light curve from Fermi and the quasi-simultaneous data from Swift. Methods. We used the Bayesian Block algorithm to identify epochs of flaring and quiescent flux states and modelled the broadband SEDs for those epochs. We employed the one-zone leptonic model in which the synchrotron emission is responsible for the low energy part of the SED and the high energy part is produced by the IC emission of external seed photons. We also investigated its multiband variability properties, gamma-ray flux distribution and the correlation between optical and gamma-ray emissions. Results. We observed a historically bright flare from B2 1308+326 across the optical-to-gamma bands during June-July 2022. The highest daily-averaged gamma-ray flux was (14.24$\pm$2.36) $\times$ 10$^{-7}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ detected on 2022 July 1. The gamma-ray flux distribution was found to be log-normal. The optical and gamma-ray emissions are well correlated with zero time lag. The synchrotron peak frequency changes from 9 $\times$ 10$^{12}$ Hz to 6 $\times$ 10$^{14}$ Hz together with a decrease in the Compton dominance providing a hint of source transition from a LSP to an ISP. The SEDs for those two states are well-fitted by one-zone leptonic models. The parameters in the model fits are essentially consistent between both SEDs, except for the Doppler beaming factor which changes from 13.4 to 27 during the transition. Conclusions. An increase in the Doppler factor could be responsible for both the flare and the transition of B2 1308+326 from LSP to ISP blazar.
#### Effects of Annihilation with Low-Energy Neutrinos on High-Energy  Neutrinos from Binary Neutron Star Mergers and Rare Core-Collapse Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the possibility that high-energy (HE) neutrinos produced at mildly relativistic shocks can be annihilated with low-energy (LE) neutrinos emitted from the accretion disk around a black hole in binary neutron star mergers and rare core-collapse supernovae. For HE neutrinos produced close to the stellar center ($\lesssim 10^{9}-10^{11}$ cm), we find that the emerging all-flavor spectrum for neutrinos of $E\gtrsim 0.1$ PeV could be modified by a factor $E^{-n}$ with $n\approx 0.4-0.5$. Flavor evolution of LE neutrinos does not affect this result but can change the emerging flavor composition of HE neutrinos. As a consequence, the above annihilation effect needs to be considered for HE neutrinos produced at nonrelativistic or mildly relativistic shocks at small radii. In particular, we point out that models of core-collapse supernovae with slow jets and charmed meson decay can better fit the diffuse HE neutrino flux observed by IceCube if annihilation of HE and LE neutrinos is taken into account. Moreover, the relevance of charmed meson and the annihilation effect can be tested by precise measurements of the diffuse neutrino spectrum and flavor composition.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of reheating in inflationary models is crucial for understanding the early universe and gaining insights into inflationary dynamics and parameters. The reheating temperature $T_{re}$ and the duration of the reheating phase, quantified by the number of $e$-folds $N_{re}$, have significant implications for particle production, thermalization, and the primordial power spectrum. The duration of reheating affects particle abundance, including dark matter, and shapes the primordial power spectrum and cosmic microwave background anisotropies. By combining cosmological observations and theoretical considerations, we can constrain both $T_{re}$ and $N_{re}$, which in turn constrain the spectral index $n_s$, tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and inflation model parameters. Utilizing consistency relations among observables, such as $n_s$ and $r$, provides additional constraints on inflationary models and determines bounds for other observables like the running of the scalar spectral index. These bounds are valuable for assessing the viability of models and can serve to specify priors in Bayesian analyses of specific models. As an example of how to proceed, we study in detail a particular case of a generalized $\alpha$-attractor model that accurately reproduces observed quantities. We present equations for the conditions of instantaneous reheating, establish consistency relations, and explore the generalized $\alpha$-attractor model using cosmological data.

 - **Abstract**
 In a gaseous medium, dynamical friction (DF) reaches a maximum when the orbital speed of a (point-like) perturber moving on a circular orbit is close to the sound speed. Therefore, in a quasi-steady state, eccentric orbits of perturbers approaching the sound barrier (from below) should rapidly circularize as they experience the strongest drag at pericenter passage. To investigate this effect, we extend the solution of Desjacques et al. 2022 for circular DF in a uniform gaseous medium to eccentric Keplerian orbits. We derive an approximation to the steady-state DF force, which is valid for eccentricities as high as $e=0.9$ in a limited range of Mach number around the transition to supersonic regime. We validate our analytical result with 3-dimensional simulations of the gas density response. Although gaseous DF generally dissipates orbital energy, we find that it can be directed along the motion of the perturber near pericenter passage when the eccentricity is $e\gtrsim 0.9$. We apply our results to compute the long-time evolution of the orbital parameters. Most trajectories tend to circularize as the perturber moves into the supersonic regime. However, orbits with eccentricities $e\gtrsim 0.8$ below the sound barrier experience a slight increase in eccentricity as they loose orbital energy. Possible extensions to our analytical approach are also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 A vast majority of bright comets between the late 2nd century and the early 18th century, moving in potentially Kreutz orbits according to Hasegawa & Nakano (2001), was first sighted between 2 and 16 days after perihelion, thanks to the spectacular tails that they were then displaying. In this paper I examine the basic properties of the post-perihelion tails of the three brightest Kreutz sungrazers of the 19th and 20th centuries -- the Great March Comet of 1843 (C/1843 D1), the Great September Comet of 1882 (C/1882 R1), and Ikeya-Seki (C/1965 S1). As the pre-perihelion tail of a sungrazer sublimates completely at perihelion, the development of its post-perihelion tail starts from scratch. In the early days after perihelion, the tail length grows rapidly on account of the plasma component. At some point the dust takes over, reaching a peak length weeks later. As the geocentric distance continues to increase and the surface brightness to decline, the tail's shortening sets in. The dust tails of Ikeya-Seki and the 1843 sungrazer contained grains subjected to solar radiation pressure accelerations not exceeding 0.6-0.7 the solar gravitational acceleration, the dust tail of the 1882 sungrazer was more complex. For weeks this comet appeared like a comet in a comet, a result of disintegration of a distant companion near perihelion. Evening Kreutz sungrazers are found to have longer tails than morning ones because of geometry. Other issues are discussed and extensive sets of tail data are provided.

 - **Abstract**
 The near-term capability to characterize terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres may bring us closer to discovering alien life through atmospheric data. However, remotely detectable candidate biosignature gases are subject to possible false positive signals as they can also be produced abiotically. To distinguish biological, abiotic and anomalous sources of these atmospheric gases, we take a complex systems approach using chemical reaction network analysis of planetary atmospheres. We simulated 30,000 terrestrial atmospheres, organized in two datasets: Archean Earth-like worlds and modern Earth-like worlds. For Archean Earth-like worlds we study cases where CH4 is produced abiotically via serpentinization, biologically via methanogenesis, or from anomalous sources. We also simulate modern Earth-like atmospheres with and without industrial CFC-12. Network properties like mean degree and average shortest path length effectively distinguish scenarios where CH4 is produced from methanogenesis and serpentinization, with biologically driven networks exhibiting higher connectivity and efficiency. Network analysis also distinguishes modern Earth atmospheres with CFC-12 from those without, with industrially polluted networks showing increased mean degree. Using Bayesian analysis, we demonstrate how atmospheric network property statistics can provide stronger confidence for ruling out biological explanations compared to gas abundance statistics alone. Our results confirm how a network theoretic approach allows distinguishing biological, abiotic and anomalous atmospheric drivers, including ruling out life-as-we-know-it as a possible explanation. Developing statistical inference methods for spectral data that incorporate network properties could significantly strengthen future biosignature detection efforts.

 - **Abstract**
 Photoelectric observations of night sky brightness (NSB) at different zenith distances and azimuths, covering all the sky, at the Egyptian Kottamia Astronomical observatory (KAO) site of coordinates {\phi} = 29{\deg}55.9'N and {\lambda} = 31{\deg}49.5' E, were done using a fully automated photoelectric photometer (FAPP). The Bessel wide range system (UBVRI) is used for the first time to observe NSB for three consecutive nights (1 to 3 August, 2022) under good seeing conditions after the moon sets. The deduced results were taken in photons and converted into mag/arcsec2. The average zenith sky brightness for U, B, V, R and I filters are found to be 20.49, 20.38, 19.41, 18.60 and 17.94 mag/arcsec2 respectively. The average color indices (U-B), (B-V), (V-R) and (R-I), at the zenith are detected to be 0.11, 0.98, 0.81 and 0.66, respectively. We plotted the isophotes of the sky brightness at KAO in U, B, V, R and I colors (filters) and determined both the average atmospheric extinction and sky transparency through these UBVRI filters. The atmospheric and other meteorological conditions were taken into our consideration during the observational nights. The results of the current study illustrate the main impact of the new cities built around KAO on the sky glow over it, and which astronomical observations are affected.

 Within this proceeding, we introduce the U-Board platform, a versatile platform for signal generation, acquisition and processing, based on a heterogenous processing architecture. Based on this platform we present a readout for Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) for the A-MKID camera for APEX. In addition to the implementation of the readout on this heterogenous architecture, we also present a first comparison of the performance of the readout compared to the currently used readout of the A-MKID camera. Last but not least, we discuss how we plan to miniaturize the current prototype, which is based on commercial off the shelf components.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent cosmological observations show a statistically significant tension in the estimated values of the cosmological parameters within the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework. In a recent study, Li and Shafieloo introduced a simple Phenomenological Emergent Dark Energy (PEDE) model, which possesses the same number of parameters as that of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Their research highlighted this model as a viable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM, capable of alleviating the Hubble tension and explaining the late-time cosmic acceleration. Following this, we consider a series of PEDE-type models where a new parameter $b$ is introduced in the dark energy expression that distinguishes one model from the other and is designated as bPEDE models. The PEDE and $\Lambda$CDM models were the special cases of the bPEDE model. In contrast to the PEDE model, the bPEDE model demonstrates the presence of dark energy in the past while indicating its absence in the asymptotic future. Confronting these models with the observational Hubble data (OHD) shows that a series of bPEDE models fit the data better than the PEDE model and the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Notably, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) value computed using the best-fit bPEDE models closely aligns with the CMBR prediction. It significantly deviates from the local measurement at a significance level of approximately $3.4\sigma$ for the model independent OHD data combination. The outcome suggests reconsidering the systematic uncertainties associated with the local measurement. The best-fit bPEDE models predict the deceleration to acceleration transition at a redshift $z_T \sim 0.78$ which is in close agreement with the $\Lambda$CDM prediction. The age of the universe predicted by the bPEDE model is $\sim 14$ Gyr, slightly higher than the age predicted by the $\Lambda$CDM model. The statefinder trajectory reveals a quintessence nature of dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of two exoplanets around the M dwarfs GJ 724 and GJ 3988 using the radial velocity (RV) method. We obtained a total of 153 3.5 m Calar Alto/CARMENES spectra for both targets and measured their RVs and activity indicators. We also added archival ESO/HARPS data for GJ 724 and infrared RV measurements from Subaru/IRD for GJ 3988. We searched for periodic and stable signals to subsequently construct Keplerian models, considering different numbers of planets, and we selected the best models based on their Bayesian evidence. Gaussian process (GP) regression was included in some models to account for activity signals. For both systems, the best model corresponds to one single planet. The minimum masses are $10.75^{+0.96}_{-0.87}$ and $3.69^{+0.42}_{-0.41}$ Earth-masses for GJ 724 b and GJ 3988 b, respectively. Both planets have short periods (P < 10 d) and, therefore, they orbit their star closely (a < 0.05 au). GJ 724 b has an eccentric orbit (e = $0.577^{+0.055}_{-0.052}$), whereas the orbit of GJ 3988 b is circular. The high eccentricity of GJ 724 b makes it the most eccentric single exoplanet (to this date) around an M dwarf. Thus, we suggest a further analysis to understand its configuration in the context of planetary formation and architecture. In contrast, GJ 3988 b is an example of a common type of planet around mid-M dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmological 21 cm signal is one of the most promising avenues to study the Epoch of Reionization. One class of experiments aiming to detect this signal is global signal experiments measuring the sky-averaged 21 cm brightness temperature as a function of frequency. A crucial step in the interpretation and analysis of such measurements is separating foreground contributions from the remainder of the signal, requiring accurate models for both components. Current models for the signal (non-foreground) component, which may contain cosmological and systematic contributions, are incomplete and unable to capture the full signal. We propose two new methods for extracting this component from the data: Firstly, we employ a foreground-orthogonal Gaussian Process to extract the part of the signal that cannot be explained by the foregrounds. Secondly, we use a FlexKnot parameterization to model the full signal component in a free-form manner, not assuming any particular shape or functional form. This method uses Bayesian model selection to find the simplest signal that can explain the data. We test our methods on both, synthetic data and publicly available EDGES low-band data. We find that the Gaussian Process can clearly capture the foreground-orthogonal signal component of both data sets. The FlexKnot method correctly recovers the full shape of the input signal used in the synthetic data and yields a multi-modal distribution of different signal shapes that can explain the EDGES observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer Cherenkov detector that is deployed deep in the Antarctic ice at the South Pole. A square kilometer companion surface detector, IceTop, located directly above in the in-ice array, measures cosmic-ray initiated extensive air showers with primary energies between 100 TeV and 1 EeV. By combining the events measured by IceTop and the in-ice detectors of IceCube in coincidence, we can reconstruct the energy spectra for different primary mass groups. Therefore, we provide information about the origin of cosmic rays, in particular, in the transition region from galactic to extra-galactic origin of high-energy cosmic rays. In this contribution we present recent experimental results, as well as prospects by the foreseen enhancement of the surface detectors of IceTop and the future IceCube-Gen2 surface array.
#### Gaia uncovers difference in B and Be star binarity at small scales:  evidence for mass transfer causing the Be phenomenon

 - **Abstract**
 Be stars make up almost 20% of the B star population, and are rapidly rotating stars surrounded by a disc; however the origin of this rotation remains unclear. Mass transfer within close binaries provides the leading hypothesis, and previous detections of stripped companions to Be stars supporting this. Here, we exploit the exquisite astrometric precision of Gaia to carry out the largest to date comparative study into the binarity of matched samples of nearby B and Be stars from the Bright Star Catalogue. By utilising new ''proper motion anomaly'' values, derived from Gaia DR2 and DR3 astrometric data alongside previous values calculated using Hipparcos and Gaia data, and the Gaia provided RUWE, we demonstrate that we can identify unresolved binaries down to separations of 0.02''. Using these measures, we find that the binary fractions of B and Be stars are similar between 0.04 - 10'', but the Be binary fraction is significantly lower than that of the B stars for separations below 0.04''. As the separation range of these ''missing'' binaries is too large for mass transfer, and stripped companions are not retrieved by these measures, we suggest the companions migrate inwards via binary hardening within a triple system. This confirms statistically for the first time the hypothesis that binary interaction causes the Be phenomenon, with migration causing the dearth of Be binaries between 0.02 - 0.04''. Furthermore, we suggest that triplicity plays a vital role in this migration, and thus in the formation of Be stars as a whole.

 - **Abstract**
 Seismic Newtonian noise is predicted to limit the sensitivity of the Einstein Telescope. It can be reduced with coherent noise cancellation techniques using data from seismometers. To achieve the best results, it is important to place the seismic sensors in optimal positions. A preliminary study on this topic was conducted for the Einstein Telescope (ET): it focused on the optimization of the seismic array for the cancellation of Newtonian noise at an isolated test mass. In this paper, we expand the study to include the nested shape of ET, i.e., four test masses of the low-frequency interferometers at each vertex of the detector. Results are investigated in function of the polarization content of the seismic field composed of body waves. The study also examines how performance can be affected by displacing the sensor array from its optimal position or by operating at frequencies other than those used for optimization.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying small near-Earth asteroids is important to understand their dynamical histories and origins as well as to mitigate the damage of the asteroid impact to the Earth. We report the results of multicolor photometry of the tiny near-Earth asteroid 2015 RN$_{35}$ using the 3.8 m Seimei telescope in Japan and the TRAPPIST-South telescope in Chile over 17 nights in 2022 December and 2023 January. We observed 2015 RN$_{35}$ across a wide range of phase angles from 2$^{\circ}$ to 30$^{\circ}$ in the $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$ bands in the Pan-STARRS system. These lightcurves show that 2015 RN$_{35}$ is in a non-principal axis spin state with two characteristic periods of $1149.7\pm0.3$ s and $896.01\pm0.01$ s. We found that a slope of a visible spectrum of 2015 RN$_{35}$ is as red as asteroid (269) Justitia, one of the very red objects in the main belt, which indicates that 2015 RN$_{35}$ can be classified as an A- or Z-type asteroid. In conjunction with the shallow slope of the phase curve, we suppose that 2015 RN$_{35}$ is a high-albedo A-type asteroid. We demonstrated that surface properties of tiny asteroids could be well constrained by intensive observations across a wide range of phase angles. 2015 RN$_{35}$ is a possible mission accessible A-type near-Earth asteroid with a small $\Delta v$ of 11.801 km s$^{-1}$ in the launch window between 2030 and 2035.
#### Impact of the uncertainties of $3 α$ and $^{12}{\rm  C}(α,γ)^{16}{\rm O}$ reactions on the He-burning phases of low- and  intermediate-mass stars

 - **Abstract**
 We estimate the impact on the stellar evolution of the uncertainties in the $3\alpha$ and the $^{12}{\rm C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}{\rm O}$ reaction rates [...]. We calculated models of low- and intermediate-mass stars for different values of the rates. The $3\alpha$ reaction rate was varied up to $\pm 24\%$, while the $^{12}{\rm C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}{\rm O}$ reaction rate was varied by up to $\pm 35\%$. The models were calculated for two different initial chemical compositions to represent different stellar populations. A $M = 0.67$ $M_{\odot}$ model was chosen as representative of the halo ancient stars, while for disk stars, the $M=1.5$ $M_{\odot}$ and $M=2.5$ $M_{\odot}$ models were considered. The impact of the two reaction rates on the central He-burning lifetime and the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) lifetime, as well as the mass of the C/O core at the central He exhaustion and the internal C and O abundances, was investigated. A variation of the $^{12}{\rm C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}{\rm O}$ reaction rates resulted in marginal differences in the analysed features among the three considered stellar masses, except for the C/O abundances. The central He-burning lifetime changed by less than 4%, while the AGB lifetime was affected only at the 1% level. The internal C and O abundances showed greater variation, with a change of about 15%. The uncertainty in the $3\alpha$ reaction rate mainly influences the C and O central abundances (up to 10%) for all the models considered, and the AGB lifetime for intermediate mass stars (up to 5%). Most of the investigated features were affected by less than 2%. The current uncertainty in the two reaction rates has a negligible effect on the predicted evolutionary time scale with respect to other uncertainty sources. The variability in the chemical profile at the end of the shell He-burning phase is still relevant.

 - **Abstract**
 A first look is taken at the NIRSpec 1-5 $\mu$m observations from JWST program 1591 that targets 7 objects along the low-mass stellar life cycle with PAH emission. Spectra extracted from a 1.5$^{\prime\prime}$ radius sized circular aperture are explored, showing a wealth of features, including the 3 $\mu$m PAH complex, the PAH-continuum, and atomic and molecular emission lines from HI, He, H$_{\rm 2}$, and other species. CO$_{\rm 2}$- and H$_{\rm 2}$O-ice absorption and CO emission is also seen. Focusing on the bright-PDR position in M17, the PAH CH stretch falls at 3.29 $\mu$m (FWHM=0.04 $\mu$m). Signs of its 1.68 $\mu$m overtone are confused by line emission in all targets. Multi-component decomposition reveals a possible aliphatic deuterated PAH feature centered at 4.65 $\mu$m (FWHM=0.02 $\mu$m), giving [D/H]$_{\rm alip.}$=31$\pm$12.7%. However, there is little sign of its aromatic counterpart between 4.36-4.43 $\mu$m. There is also little sign of PAH-nitrile emission between 4.34-4.39 $\mu$m. A PAH continuum rises from $\sim$1 to 3.2 $\mu$m, after which it jumps by about a factor of 2.5 at 3.6 $\mu$m, with bumps at 3.8, 4.04, and 4.34 $\mu$m adding structure. The CO$_{\rm 2}$ absorption band in M17 is matched with 10:1 H$_{\rm 2}$O:CO$_{\rm 2}$ ice at 10 K. The $v$=0 pure rotational molecular hydrogen population diagram reveals $>$2200 K UV-pumped gas. The hydrogen Pfund series runs from levels 10 to $>$30. Considering Br$\alpha$/Br$\beta$=0.381$\pm$0.01966 and Case B recombination results in A$_{\rm V}{\simeq}$8. CO emission in IRAS21282+5050 originates from 258 K gas. In-depth spectral-spatial analysis of all features and targets are planned for a series of forthcoming papers.

 - **Abstract**
 We test the convergence of fast simulations based on the COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) method for predictions of the matter power spectrum, specialising our analysis in the redshift range $1 \le z \le 1.65$, relevant to high-redshift spectroscopic galaxy surveys. We then focus on the enhancement of the matter power spectrum in modified gravity (MG), the boost factor, using the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) theory as a test case but developing a general approach that can be applied to other MG theories. After identifying the minimal simulation requirements for accurate DGP boost factors, we design and produce a COLA simulation suite that we use to train a neural network emulator for the DGP boost factor. Using MG-AREPO simulations as a reference, we estimate the emulator accuracy to be of $\sim 3\%$ up to $k=5 \, h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at $0 \leq z \leq 2$. We make the emulator publicly available at: https://github.com/BartolomeoF/nDGPemu.

 Diamond operated as a cryogenic calorimeter is an excellent target for direct detection of low-mass dark matter candidates. Following the realization of the first low-threshold cryogenic detector that uses diamond as absorber for astroparticle physics applications, we now present the resulting exclusion limits on the elastic spin-independent interaction cross-section of dark matter with diamond. We measured two 0.175 g CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) diamond samples, each instrumented with a W-TES. Thanks to the energy threshold of just 16.8 eV of one of the two detectors, we set exclusion limits on the elastic spin-independent interaction of dark matter particles with carbon nuclei down to dark matter masses as low as 0.122 GeV/c2. This work shows the scientific potential of cryogenic detectors made from diamond and lays the foundation for the use of this material as target for direct detection dark matter experiments.

 We present an analysis of high-resolution far-ultraviolet archival spectra obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope of the star HD 75309, which probes high-velocity shocked gas in the Vela supernova remnant (SNR). We examine high-velocity features from intrinsically strong absorption lines of O I, Si II, Si II*, C II, C II*, and Si III. We also detect high-velocity components in the N V doublet and compare these features to observations of high-velocity O VI absorption, available from archival Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer data. Kinetic temperatures are derived from the observed fractional abundances of the various ions, while gas densities and thermal pressures are obtained from the relative populations in excited fine-structure levels of C II and Si II. Our results indicate that the highly ionized species at high velocity probe gas in a region immediately behind a shock driven into an interstellar cloud, while the lower ionization species trace material further downstream in the cooling region of the post-shock flow. Low velocity N V and O VI absorption may trace gas in a conductive boundary layer between the unshocked portion of the cloud and the hot X-ray emitting intercloud medium. Temporal variations in high velocity Ca II absorption features observed toward HD 75309 further confirm the highly inhomogeneous nature of the interstellar medium interacting with the Vela SNR.

 - **Abstract**
 Eclipse timing variations (ETV) have been a successful tool for detecting circumbinary companions to eclipsing binaries (EB). While TESS and Kepler have been prolific for ETV searches, they sometimes can be limited by time and sky coverage which can be addressed by specialised ground-based ETV surveys. We present the initial results from the Solaris photometric survey which uses four 0.5m robotic telescopes in the southern hemisphere to look for circumbinary companions. We present the method of light curve extraction, detrending, and EB modelling using the observations from the Solaris network. Using these light curves we extract precise eclipse timing for 7 EB and look for companions using a Lomb-Scargle periodogram search. We find two possible periodic signals for the target GSC 08814-01026. With the system having strong activity, we check for the feasibility of orbital solutions at these two periods. We find that the 245 +/- 1 d period is due to an M-dwarf mass companion. This makes GSC 08814-01026 a candidate compact hierarchical triple system. The other periodic signal at 146 +/- 1 d is an artefact of stellar activity.
