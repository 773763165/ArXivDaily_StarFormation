          A population study on the effect of metallicity on ZAMS to the merger

 - **Abstract**
 Multiband observations of compact object sources offer a unique opportunity to explore their progenitors and enhance early multi-messenger alert. Recent analyses have indicated that metallicity significantly impacts the evolution of progenitors and the resulting compact objects. Using binary population synthesis, we investigate the formation of eccentric, inspiralling black hole binaries and black hole-neutron star binaries through the isolated binary evolution channel. We introduced a fiducial mass and metallicity relation for each ZAMS star. We model the stellar cluster of ZAMS stars by extending COSMIC's publicly available code. Our BPS code effectively accounts for the metallicity of each stellar object in the stellar cluster. In our analysis, we observed a significant increase in the number of inspiral binaries remaining in the stellar cluster. Instead of assuming a uniform metallicity for a stellar cluster, ZAMS stars within the cluster, characterized by diverse metallicity, evolve into more massive compact objects. The total mass of a single binary black hole inspiral varies from $\sim 9-86$ M$_\odot$; whereas for a black hole-neutron star system, this range becomes $\sim 6-32$ M$_\odot$. We compare the detectability of the characteristic strain against sub-Hz gravitational wave detectors.

          A Novel Density Profile for Isothermal Cores of Dark Matter Halos

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel density profile for halos in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models, which accurately captures the flat- and isothermal-core configurations. We show analytically how our density profile satisfies these conditions, with comparisons to other contemporary functional choices. We demonstrate the versatility of our profile by putting it into the context of idealized N-body simulations and show that it provides excellent representations for both density and velocity dispersion structures of the simulation data. When an estimated fitting criterion is used to approximate the general cases, such as in cosmological simulations, the resulting regressions maintain their goodness of fit in both extremes, in the initial thermalization phase and the late core-collapse regime. Our density profile provides a framework for more detailed analyses of halos in different SIDM models while serving as the basis for reducing simulation needs and constructing initial conditions for deep core-collapse simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 For the past decade, the high-contrast observation of disks and gas giant planets around nearby stars has been made possible on ground-based instruments using extreme adaptive optics (XAO). While these facilities produce images with a Strehl ratio larger than 90% in H-band in median observing conditions and high-flux regime, the correction leaves AO residuals which prevent the study of fainter or less massive exoplanets. Cascade AO systems with a fast second stage based on a Pyramid wavefront sensor have recently emerged as an appealing solution to reduce the atmospheric wavefront errors. Since these aberrations are expected to be small, they can also be accurately measured by a Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS), a well-known concept for its high sensitivity and moderate linear capture range. We propose an alternative second stage relying on the ZWFS to correct for the AO residuals. The cascade AO with a ZWFS-based control loop is implemented on the ESO's GHOST testbed to validate the scheme in monochromatic light. In median wind speed and seeing, our second-stage AO with a ZWFS and a basic integrator reduce the atmospheric residuals by a factor of 6 and increase the wavefront error stability with a gain of 2 from open to closed loop. In the presence of non common path aberrations, we also reach a contrast gain by a factor of 2 in the images with a Lyot coronagraph at short separations from the source, proving the ability of our scheme to work in cascade with an XAO loop and help imaging fainter or lighter close-in companions. In more challenging conditions, contrast improvements are also achieved by adjusting the control loop features. Our study validates the ZWFS-based second-stage AO loop as an effective solution to address small residuals left from a single-stage XAO system for the coronagraphic observations of circumstellar environments.

          ALMA observations of the gamma-ray binary system PSR B1259-63/LS 2883 during the 2024 periastron passage

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of the gamma-ray binary PSR B1259-63/LS 2883 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at Bands 3 (97 GHz), 6 (233 GHz), and 7 (343 GHz). PSR B1259-63/LS 2883 consists of a pulsar in a highly eccentric orbit around a massive companion star, with the pulsar passing through the circumstellar disk near periastron. Our new data were obtained over several epochs, ranging from -61 to +29 days from the periastron passage in 2024. We report an increase in flux in all bands near the periastron. The significant change in Band 3 flux suggests synchrotron emission from the interaction between the pulsar wind and the stellar wind or disk. The Band 6 flux shows an increase around periastron and a transition from thermal emission from the circumstellar disk to synchrotron emission. The Band 7 observation +24 days after periastron shows a brightening, suggesting that the pulsar's passage through the disk does not result in its immediate destruction. We discuss the implications of these results for the interaction between the pulsar wind and the circumstellar disk, such as the possible disk expansion after periastron.

          Testing for Intrinsic Type Ia Supernova Luminosity Evolution at z>2 with JWST

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is opening new frontiers of transient discovery and follow-up at high-redshift. Here we present the discovery of a spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernova (SN Ia; SN 2023aeax) at z=2.15 with JWST, with cadenced NIRCam observations that enable multi-band light curve fitting. SN 2023aeax lands at the edge of traditional low-z cosmology color cuts because of its blue color (peak rest-frame B-V~-0.3), but we still apply a fiducial standardization approach with the BayeSN model and find that the SN 2023aeax luminosity distance measurement is in agreement (~0.1sigma) with LambdaCDM. SN 2023aeax is only the second spectroscopically confirmed SN Ia in the dark matter-dominated Universe at z>2 (the other is SN 2023adsy), giving it rare leverage to constrain any potential evolution in SN Ia standardized luminosities. Similar to SN 2023adsy (B-V~0.8), SN 2023aeax has a fairly extreme (but opposite) color, which may be due to the small sample size or a secondary factor, such as host galaxy properties. Nevertheless, the SN 2023aeax spectrum is well-represented by normal low-z SN Ia spectra and we find no definitive evolution in SN Ia standardization with redshift. Still, the first two spectroscopically confirmed z>2 SNe Ia have peculiar colors and combine for a ~1sigma distance slope relative to LambdaCDM, the implications of which require a larger sample and dedicated host galaxy observations to investigate.

          New Evidence for a Flux-independent Spectral Index of Sgr A* in the Near-infrared

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we measure the spectral index of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) between the $H$ (1.6 $\mu$m) and $K^\prime$ (2.2 $\mu$m) broadband filters in the near-infrared (NIR), sampling over a factor $\sim 40$ in brightness, the largest range probed to date by a factor $\sim 3$. Sgr A*-NIR is highly variable, and studying the spectral index $\alpha$ (with $F_\nu \propto \nu^{\alpha}$) is essential to determine the underlying emission mechanism. For example, variations in $\alpha$ with flux may arise from shifts in the synchrotron cutoff frequency, changes in the distribution of electrons, or multiple concurrent emission mechanisms. We investigate potential variations of $\alpha_{H-K^\prime}$ with flux by analyzing 7 epochs (2005 to 2022) of Keck Observatory imaging observations from the Galactic Center Orbits Initiative (GCOI). We remove the flux contribution of known sources confused with Sgr A*-NIR, which can significantly impact color at faint flux levels. We interpolate between the interleaved $H$ and $K^\prime$ observations using Multi-Output Gaussian Processes. We introduce a flexible empirical model to quantify $\alpha$ variations and probe different scenarios. The observations are best fit by an $\alpha_{H-K^\prime} = - 0.50 \pm 0.08 _{\rm stat} \pm 0.17_{\rm sys}$ that is constant from $\sim 1$ mJy to $\sim 40$ mJy (dereddened 2 $\mu$m flux). We find no evidence for a flux-dependence of Sgr A*'s intrinsic spectral index. In particular, we rule out a model explaining NIR variability purely by shifts in the synchrotron cutoff frequency. We also constrain the presence of redder, quiescent emission from the black hole, concluding that the dereddened 2 $\mu$m flux contribution must be $\leq 0.3$ mJy at 95% confidence level.

          A Novel Bispectrum Estimator of the Kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect using Projected Fields

 - **Abstract**
 With the advent of current and future high-resolution CMB experiments, the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect has become a unique observational probe of the distribution of baryons and velocities in the Universe. In this work, we propose a novel binned bispectrum of the form temperature-temperature-density to extract the late-time kSZ effect from cleaned CMB maps. Unlike 'kSZ tomography' methods, this estimator can use any tracer of the large-scale structure density field projected along the line-of-sight and does not require individual redshifts. With our method, we forecast signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of $\sim$100-200 for the upcoming Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4 correlated with a galaxy sample from WISE that is restricted to the linear regime. We also extend galaxy modes into the non-linear regime and explore this harmonic space to show that the SNR peaks for squeezed triangles that have a short (linear) density mode and long temperature modes in harmonic space. The existing kSZ$^{2}$-density projected-fields estimator compresses the rich information contained in this bispectrum across various scales and triangle shapes. Moreover, we find that the lensing correction to our estimator's signal is relatively small. We study the dependence of this kSZ signal on $\Lambda$CDM parameters for SO and CMB-S4 and forecast initial constraints on the sum of neutrino masses while restricting to the linear galaxy bias regime. Our work illustrates the potential of the projected-fields kSZ bispectrum as a novel probe of baryonic abundance and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology with upcoming precision measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 The Space Telescope Imaging Product Simulator (STIPS) is a Python-based package that can be used to simulate scenes from the upcoming \textit{Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope} (\nancy). STIPS is able to generate post-pipeline astronomical images of any number of sensor chip assembly (SCA) detectors, up to the entire 18-SCA Wide-Field Instrument array on \nancy. STIPS can inject either point spread functions generated with {\tt WebbPSF}, or extended sources in any of the \nancy filters. The output images can include flat field, dark current, and cosmic ray residuals. Additionally, STIPS includes an estimate of Poisson and readout noise, as well as an estimate of the zodiacal background and internal background from the telescope. However, STIPS does not include instrument saturation, non-linearity, or distortion effects. STIPS is provided as an open source repository on GitHub.

 - **Abstract**
 Light echoes offer a means of studying protoplanetary disks, including their geometry and composition, even when they are not spatially resolved. We present a test of this approach applied specifically to optically thick, geometrically flared disks around active stars. Here we adopt stellar parameters of an active M dwarf to calculate light echoes for disks and rings with radii that would produce time delays consistent with TESS short cadence (about 2 minutes) time bins. Our results show successful fits to disk parameters, highlighting the potential effectiveness of this method in the search for protoplanetary disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter is theorised to form massive haloes, which could be further condensed into so-called spikes when a black hole grows at the centre of such a halo. The existence of these spikes is instrumental for several dark matter detection schemes such as indirect detection and imprints on gravitational wave inspirals, but all previous work on their formation has been (semi-)analytical. We present fully numerically simulated cold dark matter spikes using the SWIFT code. Based on these results, we propose a simple empirical density profile - dependent on only a single mass-ratio parameter between the black hole and total mass - for dark matter spikes grown in Hernquist profiles. We find that the radius of the spike scales differently compared to theoretical predictions, and show a depletion of the outer halo that is significant for high mass-ratio systems. We critically assess approximations of the spike as used in the field, show that our profile significantly deviates, and contextualise the potential influence for future dark matter detections by simulating binary black hole inspirals embedded in our profile.

 - **Abstract**
 We present cosmological results from the measurement of clustering of galaxy, quasar and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest tracers from the first year of observations with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI Data Release 1). We adopt the full-shape (FS) modeling of the power spectrum, including the effects of redshift-space distortions, in an analysis which has been validated in a series of supporting papers. In the flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, DESI (FS+BAO), combined with a baryon density prior from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and a weak prior on the scalar spectral index, determines matter density to $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.2962\pm 0.0095$, and the amplitude of mass fluctuations to $\sigma_8=0.842\pm 0.034$. The addition of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data tightens these constraints to $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.3056\pm 0.0049$ and $\sigma_8=0.8121\pm 0.0053$, while further addition of the the joint clustering and lensing analysis from the Dark Energy Survey Year-3 (DESY3) data leads to a 0.4% determination of the Hubble constant, $H_0 = (68.40\pm 0.27)\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. In models with a time-varying dark energy equation of state, combinations of DESI (FS+BAO) with CMB and type Ia supernovae continue to show the preference, previously found in the DESI DR1 BAO analysis, for $w_0>-1$ and $w_a<0$ with similar levels of significance. DESI data, in combination with the CMB, impose the upper limits on the sum of the neutrino masses of $\sum m_\nu < 0.071\,{\rm eV}$ at 95% confidence. DESI data alone measure the modified-gravity parameter that controls the clustering of massive particles, $\mu_0=0.11^{+0.45}_{-0.54}$, while the combination of DESI with the CMB and the clustering and lensing analysis from DESY3 constrains both modified-gravity parameters, giving $\mu_0 = 0.04\pm 0.22$ and $\Sigma_0 = 0.044\pm 0.047$, in agreement with general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 We present cosmological constraints on deviations from general relativity (GR) from the first-year of clustering observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in combination with other datasets. We first consider the $\mu(a,k)$-$\Sigma(a,k)$ modified gravity (MG) parametrization (as well as $\eta(a,k)$) in flat $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0 w_a$CDM backgrounds. Using a functional form for time-only evolution gives $\mu_0= 0.11^{+0.44}_{-0.54}$ from DESI(FS+BAO)+BBN and a wide prior on $n_{s}$. Using DESI(FS+BAO)+CMB+DESY3+DESY5-SN, we obtain $\mu_0 = 0.05\pm 0.22$ and $\Sigma_0 = 0.009\pm 0.045$ in the $\Lambda$CDM background. In $w_0 w_a$CDM, we obtain $\mu_0 =-0.24^{+0.32}_{-0.28}$ and $\Sigma_0 = 0.006\pm 0.043$, consistent with GR, and we still find a preference of the data for dynamical dark energy with $w_0>-1$ and $w_a<0$. We then use binned forms in the two backgrounds starting with two bins in redshift and then combining them with two bins in scale for a total of 4 and 8 MG parameters, respectively. All MG parameters are found consistent with GR. We also find that the tension reported for $\Sigma_0$ with GR when using Planck PR3 goes away when we use the recent LoLLiPoP+HiLLiPoP likelihoods. As noted previously, this seems to indicate that the tension is related to the CMB lensing anomaly in PR3 which is also alleviated when using these likelihoods. We then constrain the class of Horndeski theory in the effective field theory of dark energy. We consider both EFT-basis and $\alpha$-basis. Assuming a power law parametrization for the function $\Omega$, which controls non-minimal coupling, we obtain $\Omega_0 = 0.0120^{+0.0021}_{-0.013}$ and $s_0 = 0.99^{+0.54}_{-0.20}$ from DESI(FS+BAO)+DESY5SN+CMB in a $\Lambda$CDM background. Similar results are obtained when using the $\alpha$-basis, where we constrain $c_M<1.24$, and are all consistent with GR. [Abridged.]

 - **Abstract**
 The estimation of uncertainties in cosmological parameters is an important challenge in Large-Scale-Structure (LSS) analyses. For standard analyses such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Full Shape, two approaches are usually considered. First: analytical estimates of the covariance matrix use Gaussian approximations and (nonlinear) clustering measurements to estimate the matrix, which allows a relatively fast and computationally cheap way to generate matrices that adapt to an arbitrary clustering measurement. On the other hand, sample covariances are an empirical estimate of the matrix based on en ensemble of clustering measurements from fast and approximate simulations. While more computationally expensive due to the large amount of simulations and volume required, these allow us to take into account systematics that are impossible to model analytically. In this work we compare these two approaches in order to enable DESI's key analyses. We find that the configuration space analytical estimate performs satisfactorily in BAO analyses and its flexibility in terms of input clustering makes it the fiducial choice for DESI's 2024 BAO analysis. On the contrary, the analytical computation of the covariance matrix in Fourier space does not reproduce the expected measurements in terms of Full Shape analyses, which motivates the use of a corrected mock covariance for DESI's Full Shape analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Clouds and hazes are abundant in the thin and cold atmospheres of Triton and Pluto, where they are thought to be produced by interactions between atmospheric gases and ultraviolet photons from the Sun and those scattered by the local interstellar medium. These interactions lead to a rich network of chemical reactions that produces higher order hydrocarbons and nitriles that condense out to form ice clouds, and ultimately complex haze particles that rain down onto the surface that impact the atmospheric thermal structure, gas chemistry, and surface evolution. In this chapter, we will review the observational evidence for clouds and hazes in the atmospheres of Triton and Pluto and theoretical interpretations thereof, and the emerging set of experiments aiming to produce Triton and Pluto clouds and hazes in the lab to learn about them in detail.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the structural properties of strange quark stars (SQS) using a Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) perturbative model combined with the latest Particle Data Group dataset. Given the energy scale present in compact stars, QCD perturbation theory alone may not fully explain their structure. To account for non-perturbative contributions, we incorporate a density-dependent effective bag parameter, $B$, and derive the equation of state (EOS) for strange quark matter (SQM). We start by demonstrating the limitations of EOSs with a constant $B$ in describing massive objects with $ M_{TOV}> 2M_{\odot} $. Subsequently, we show that considering $B$ as a density-dependent function significantly changes the results. Our definition of $B$ includes two parameters determined by both theoretical and observational constraints. We demonstrate that incorporating a density-dependent $B$ into the perturbative EOS can yield SQSs with masses exceeding $2M_{\odot}$, while complying with gravitational wave constraints such as tidal deformability, and thermodynamic considerations, including stability conditions and speed of sound behavior. Specifically, we show that massive compact objects like PSR J0952-0607, PSR J2215+5135, PSR J0740+6620, and the secondary mass of GW190814 can be SQSs. Additionally, we compare our EOS with the EOS of the authors who use a generalized polytropic form with adjustable parameters and obtain an interesting result.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic explosions in the universe, and their afterglow emission provides an opportunity to probe the physics of relativistic shock waves in an extreme environment. Several key pieces for completing the picture of the GRB afterglow physics are still missing, including jet properties, emission mechanism, and particle acceleration. Here we present a study of the afterglow emission of GRB 221009A, the most energetic GRB ever observed. Using optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray data up to approximately two days after the trigger, we trace the evolution of the multi-wavelength spectrum and the physical parameters behind the emission process. The broadband spectrum is consistent with the synchrotron emission emitted by relativistic electrons with its index of $p = 2.29\pm 0.02$. We identify a break energy at keV and an exponential cutoff at GeV in the observed multi-wavelength spectrum. The break energy increases in time from $16.0_{-4.9}^{+7.1}$ keV at 0.65 days to $46.8_{-15.5}^{+25.0}$ keV at 1.68 days, favoring a stellar wind-like profile of the circumburst medium with $k=2.4\pm0.1$ as in $\rho (r) \propto r^{-k}$. The high-energy attenuation at around 0.4 to 4 GeV is attributed to the maximum of the particle acceleration in the relativistic shock wave. This study confirms that the synchrotron process can explain the multi-wavelength afterglow emission and its evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents the first analysis of the contact binary TYC 3801-1529-1. We observed four sets of multiple bands complete light curves and one set of radial velocity curve of the primary component. Based on a simultaneous investigation of our observed and TESS light curves and the radial velocity curve, we found that TYC 3801-1529-1 is an extremely low-mass-ratio, medium contact binary with $q=0.0356$, with the contribution of the third light at a level of about 10\%. Its mass ratio is lower than V1187 Her, making TYC 3801-1529-1 the lowest mass-ratio contact binary ever found in the universe. The light curves observed in 2022 are asymmetric, which is aptly explained by a hot spot on the primary component. A 16-year eclipse timings analysis indicates a secular increase orbital period with a rate of dp/dt$=7.96(\pm0.35)\times10^{-7}$ d yr$^{-1}$. We studied the stability of this target and identified that not only the value of $J_{spin}/J_{orb}$, but also the mass ratio surpass the unstable boundary. Hence, TYC 3801-1529-1 presents a challenge to theoretical research and ought to be considered a progenitor of a contact binary merger.

 - **Abstract**
 A planetary growth rate, a.k.a., the mass accretion rate, is a fundamental parameter in planet formation, as it determines a planet's final mass. Planetary mass accretion rates have been estimated using hydrogen lines, based on the models originally developed for accreting stars, known as the accretion flow model. Recently, Aoyama et al. (2018) introduced the accretion shock model as an alternative mechanism for hydrogen line emission. However, it remains unclear which model is more appropriate for accreting planets and substellar objects. To address this, we applied both models to archival data consisting of 96 data points from 76 accreting brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars, with masses ranging from approximately 0.02 to 0.1 $M_\sun$, to test which model best explains their accreting properties. The results showed that the emission mechanisms of 15 data points are best explained by the shock model, while 55 data points are best explained by the flow model. For the 15 data points explained by the planetary shock model, the shock model estimates up to several times higher mass accretion rates than the flow model. As this trend is more pronounced for planetary mass objects, it is crucial to determine which emission mechanism is dominant in individual planets. We also discuss the physical parameters that determine the emission mechanisms and the variability of line ratios.

 - **Abstract**
 An updated analysis of pulsar glitch parameters was conducted using a sample of 215 pulsars, encompassing 677 recorded glitch events, each glitch at least once between 1968 and 2024. The glitch rates were estimated and plotted against various pulsar parameters, including rotational frequency, spin-down rate, and characteristic age. These relationships were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The results indicate linear and weak relationships between glitch rate and the pulsar parameters. However, the relationship between glitch rate and characteristic age is inversely weak.

 - **Abstract**
 Observational studies are identifying stars thought to be remnants from the earliest stages of the hierarchical mass assembly of the Milky Way, referred to as the proto-Galaxy. We use red giant stars with kinematics and [$\alpha$/M] and [M/H] estimates from Gaia DR3 data to investigate the relationship between azimuthal velocity and metallicity, aiming to understand the transition from a chaotic proto-Galaxy to a well-ordered, rotating (old) disc-like population. To analyse the structure of the data in [M/H]-v$_\phi$ space for both high- and low-$\alpha$ samples with carefully defined $\alpha$-separation, we develop a model with two Gaussian components in v$_\phi$: one representing a disc-like population and the other a halo-like population. This model is designed to capture the conditional distribution P(v$_\phi$ $\mid$ [M/H]) with a 2-component Gaussian Mixture Model with fixed azimuthal velocities means and standard deviations. To quantify the spin-up of the high-$\alpha$ disc population, we extend this two-component model by allowing the mean velocity and velocity dispersion to vary between the spline knots across the metallicity range used. We also compare our findings with existing literature using traditional Gaussian Mixture Modelling in bins of [M/H] and investigate using orbital circularity instead of azimuthal velocity. Our findings show that the metal-poor high-$\alpha$ disc gradually spins up across [M/H] $\sim$ -1.7 to -1.0, while the low-$\alpha$ sample exhibits a sharp transition at [M/H] $\sim$ -1.0. This latter result is due to the accreted debris dominating the metal-poor end, underscoring the critical role of [$\alpha$/M] selection in studying the (old) disc evolution of the Milky Way. These results indicate that the proto-Galaxy underwent a slow, monotonic spin-up phase rather than a rapid, dramatic spin-up at [M/H] $\sim$ -1.0, as previously inferred.

 - **Abstract**
 Interferometric closure invariants, constructed from triangular loops of mixed Fourier components, capture calibration-independent information on source morphology. While a complete set of closure invariants is directly obtainable from measured visibilities, the inverse transformation from closure invariants to the source intensity distribution is not established. In this work, we demonstrate a deep learning approach, Deep learning Image Reconstruction with Closure Terms (DIReCT), to directly reconstruct the image from closure invariants. Trained on both well-defined mathematical shapes (two-dimensional gaussians, disks, ellipses, $m$-rings) and natural images (CIFAR-10), the results from our specially designed model are insensitive to station-based corruptions and thermal noise. The median fidelity score between the reconstruction and the blurred ground truth achieved is $\gtrsim 0.9$ even for untrained morphologies, where a unit score denotes perfect reconstruction. In our validation tests, DIReCT's results are comparable to other state-of-the-art deconvolution and regularised maximum-likelihood image reconstruction algorithms, with the advantage that DIReCT does not require hand-tuned hyperparameters for each individual prediction. This independent approach shows promising results and offers a calibration-independent constraint on source morphology, ultimately complementing and improving the reliability of sparse VLBI imaging results.

          Mass evolution of broad line regions to explain the luminosity variability of broad H$\alpha$ in the TDE ASASSN-14li

 - **Abstract**
 In this manuscript, an oversimplified model is proposed for the first time to explain the different variability trends in the observed broad H$\alpha$ emission line luminosity $L_{H\alpha}(t)$ and in the TDE model determined bolometric luminosity $L_{bol}(t)$ in the known TDE ASASSN-14li. Considering broad emission line regions (BLRs) lying into central accretion disk related to accreted materials onto central black hole in TDEs, mass evolution $M_{BLRs}(t)$ of central BLRs can be determined by the maximum mass $M_{BLRs,0}$ of central BLRs minus the corresponding accreted mass in a TDE. Meanwhile, through the simple linear dependence of Broad Balmer emission line luminosity on mass of BLRs, the mass evolution $M_{BLRs}(t)$ of central BLRs can be applied to describe the observed $L_{H\alpha}(t)$. Although the proposed model is oversimplified with only one free model parameter $M_{BLRs,0}$, the model with $M_{BLRs,0}\sim0.02{\rm M_\odot}$ can be applied to well describe the observed $L_{H\alpha}(t)$ in the TDE ASASSN-14li. Meanwhile, the oversimplified model can also be applied to roughly describe the observed $L_{H\alpha}(t)$ in the TDE ASASSN-14ae. The reasonable descriptions to the observed $L_{H\alpha}(t)$ in ASASSN-14li and ASASSN-14ae indicate the oversimplified model with only one free model parameter is probably efficient enough to describe mass evolutions of $M_{BLRs}$ related to central accreted debris in TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a reconstruction of the line-of-sight motions of the local interstellar medium (ISM) based on the combination of a state-of-the-art model of the three-dimensional dust density distribution within 1.25 kpc from the Sun and the HI and CO line emission within Galactic latitudes $|b| < 5^{\circ}$. We use the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) method to match the plane-of-the-sky 3D dust distribution across distances with the atomic and molecular line emission. We identify a significant correlation between the 3D dust model and the line emission. We employ this correlation to assign line-of-sight velocities to the dust across density channels and produce a face-on map of the local ISM radial motions with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR). We find that most of the material in the 3D dust model follows the large-scale pattern of Galactic rotation; however, we also report local departures from the rotation pattern with standard deviations of 12.1 and 6.1 km/s for the HI and CO line emission, respectively. The mean kinetic energy densities of these streaming motions are around 0.68 and 0.18 eV/cm$^{3}$ from either gas tracer. Assuming homogeneity and isotropy in the velocity field, these values are within a factor of a few of the total kinetic energy density. These kinetic energy values are roughly comparable to other energy densities, thus confirming the near-equipartition introduced by the feedback loops connecting the physical processes in the local ISM. Yet, we find energy and momentum overdensities of around a factor of ten concentrated in the Radcliffe Wave, the Split, and other local density structures. Although we do not find evidence of the Local Spiral Arm impact in these overdensities, their distribution suggests the influence of other large-scale effects that, in addition to supernova feedback, shape the energy distribution in the Solar neighborhood.

 - **Abstract**
 For high-energy cosmic-ray physics, it is imperative to determine the mass and energy of the cosmic ray that initiated the air shower in the atmosphere. This information can be extracted from the longitudinal profile of the air shower. In radio-metric observations, this profile is customarily determined through an extensive fitting procedure where calculated radio intensity is fitted to data. Beamforming the measured signals offers a promising alternative to bypass the cumbersome fitting procedure and to determine the longitudinal profile directly. Finite aperture effects in beamforming hamper the resolution with which this profile can be determined. We present a comprehensive investigation of the beamforming resolution in radiometric observations of air showers. There are two, principally different, approaches possible in air-shower beamforming, one where the total beamforming intensity is determined and an alternative where the beamforming trace is cross-correlated with a known response function. The effects due to a finite aperture (size of antenna array and bandwidth) are large for both approaches. We argue that it is possible to correct for the aperture corrections using an unfolding procedure. We give an explicit expression for the folding function, the kernel. Being able to calculate the folding function allows for unfolding the finite aperture effects from the data. We show that, in a model-to-model comparison, this allows for an accurate reconstruction of the current profile as the shower develops in the atmosphere. We present also an example where we reconstruct the longitudinal current profile of a shower developing under thunderstorm conditions where the atmospheric electric fields greatly alter the orientation of the transverse current in the shower front.

 Context. HD140283, or the Methuselah star, is a well-known reference object in stellar evolution. Its peculiar chemical composition, proximity and absence of reddening makes it an interesting case-study of Pop II stars. Thanks to recent observational efforts, we now have precise interferometric and spectroscopic constraints, as well as revised astrometric parallaxes from the Gaia mission. Aims. We aim at determining the age of HD140283 with these lastest constraints, as well as quantifying the impact of systematics from physical inaccuracies in the stellar evolution models. Methods. Using recent spectroscopic abundances from the literature, including 3D non-LTE values for C, O, and Fe, we compute opacity tables specific to HD140283. We then use them in grids of stellar evolution models coupled to a Markov Chain Monte Carlo tool to determine the age of HD140283. Results. With our tailored models we find an age of 12.3Gy. Using a solar-scaled mixture instead results in an age value of 14Gy, in tension with the age of the universe ($13.77\pm0.06$Gy). We also find that reducing the mixing length parameter from its solar calibrated value will lead to an even lower age, in agreement with other recent studies. However, we find no direct evidence to favour a lower mixing length parameter value from our modelling. Conclusions. Taking into account the specific elemental abundances is crucial for the modelling of HD140283, as it leads to significant differences in the inferred age. However, this effect is degenerate with a lowering of the mixing length parameter. In this respect, asteroseismic constraints might play a key role in accurately deriving the mass of HD140283, therefore strongly constraining its age.

 We detail a platform for partial g environment and an experiment for simulated impacts on asteroid surfaces based on it. The partial g environment is created by a two stage approach: First, create microgravity using the ZARM drop tower. Second, convert microgravity to partial gravity by steady acceleration of experiment volume on linear drive inside microgravity environment. The experiment we conducted on this platform simulates low-velocity impacts into a simulated asteroid surface. To recreate the asteroid environment, in addition to the partial gravity, a vacuum chamber is used. We explain requirements, setup and operation of partial gravity platform and experiment and discuss its performance. Finally, we are open for requests for external experiments which might benefit from our platform with $9.3\,$s of controlled partial gravity down to the mm/s$^2$ range with low g-jitter.

 - **Abstract**
 The ongoing physical and chemical processes in planet-forming disks set the stage for planet formation. The asymmetric disk around the young star Oph-IRS 48 has one of the most well-characterised chemical inventories, showing molecular emission from a wide variety of species at the dust trap. One of the explanations for the asymmetric structure is dust trapping by a perturbation-induced vortex. We aim to constrain the excitation properties of the molecular species SO$_2$, CH$_3$OH, and H$_2$CO. We further characterise the extent of the molecular emission, through the determination of important physical and chemical timescales at the location of the dust trap. We also investigate whether the potential vortex can influence the observable temperature structure of the gas. Through a pixel-by-pixel rotational diagram analysis, we create rotational temperature and column density maps for SO$_2$ and CH$_3$OH, while temperature maps for H$_2$CO are created using line ratios. We find temperatures of $T\sim$55 K and $T\sim$125 K for SO$_2$ and CH$_3$OH, respectively, while the line ratios point towards temperatures of T$\sim$150-300 K for H$_2$CO. The rotational diagram of CH$_3$OH is dominated by scatter and subsequent non-LTE RADEX calculations suggest that both CH$_3$OH and H$_2$CO must be sub-thermally excited. The temperatures suggest that SO$_2$ comes from a layer deep in the disk, while CH$_3$OH and H$_2$CO originate from a higher layer. While a potential radial gradient is seen in the temperature map of SO$_2$, we do not find any hints of a vortex influencing the temperature structure. The determined turbulent mixing timescale is not able to explain the emitting heights of the molecules, but the photodissociation timescales are able to explain the wider azimuthal extents of SO$_2$ and H$_2$CO compared to CH$_3$OH, where a secondary, gas-phase formation reservoir is required for H$_2$CO.

 Previous research has established a relationship between radial action and scale height in Galactic disks, unveiling a correlation between radial and vertical heating. This finding poses a challenge to our existing comprehension of heating theories and consequently encodes crucial insights into the formation and heating history of Galactic disks. In this study, we perform N-body simulations with the aim of verifying the existence of this correlation between radial action and scale height, thereby enhancing our comprehension of the heating history of Galactic disks. We find that the relationship between radial action and scale height in our simulations can be described by the same functional form observed in previous work. Furthermore, the relationships derived from our simulations align well with those of the Galactic thin disk. However, they do not coincide with the inner thick disk but exhibit a rough correspondence with the outer thick disk, suggesting the possibility that additional heating mechanisms may be required to explain the inner thick disk. We also find that the mean radial action and scale height undergo rapid increases during the initial stages of the simulation, yet remain relatively unchanged as the disk evolves further. By tracing example particles, we uncover a correlation between radial and vertical heating in our simulation: as a particle in the disk gains or loses radial action, its vertical motion tends to oscillate on a more or less extended orbit, accompanied by a tendency to migrate outward or inward, respectively. The massive, long-lasting particles in our simulation contribute to disk heating by solely enhancing the rate of increase in scale height with radial action, while maintaining the functional form that describes the relationship between these two variables.

 - **Abstract**
 In the astrophysics community it is common practice to model collisionless dust, entrained in a gas flow, as a pressureless fluid. However a pressureless fluid is fundamentally different from a collisionless fluid - the latter of which generically possess a non-zero anisotropic pressure or stress tensor. In this paper we derive a fluid model for collisionless dust, entrained in a turbulent gas, starting from the equations describing the motion of individual dust grains. We adopt a covariant formulation of our model to allow for the geometry and coordinate systems prevalent in astrophysics, and provide a closure valid for the accretion disc context. We show that the continuum mechanics properties of a dust fluid corresponds to a higher-dimensional anisotropic Maxwell fluid, after the extra dimensions are averaged out, with a dynamically important rheological stress tensor. This higher-dimensional treatment has the advantage of keeping the dust velocity and velocity of the fluid seen, and their respective moments, on the same footing. This results in a simplification of the constitutive relation describing the evolution of the dust Rheological stress.

 - **Abstract**
 The Itô and Stratonovich approaches are two ways to integrate stochastic differential equations. Detailed knowledge of the origin of the stochastic noise is needed to determine which approach suits a particular problem. I discuss this topic pedagogically in stochastic inflation, where the noise arises from a changing comoving coarse-graining scale or, equivalently, from `zooming in' into inflating space. I introduce a zoom-in scheme where deterministic evolution alternates with instantaneous zoom-in steps. I show that this alternating zoom-in scheme is equivalent to the Itô approach in the Markovian limit, while the Stratonovich approach doesn't have a similar interpretation. In the full non-Markovian setup, the difference vanishes. The framework of zoom-in schemes clarifies the relationship between computations in stochastic inflation, linear perturbation theory, and the classical $\Delta N$ formalism. It informs the numerical implementation of stochastic inflation and is a building block for a first-principles derivation of the stochastic equations.

 - **Abstract**
 As mixed with real pulsations, the reflection of super-Nyquist frequencies (SNFs) pose a threat to asteroseismic properties. Although SNFs have been studied in several pulsating stars, a systematic survey remains scarcely explored. Here we propose a method to identify SNFs from Kepler and TESS photometry by characterizing their periodic frequency modulations using a sliding Fourier transform. After analyzing long cadence photometry in the Kepler legacy, we have identified 304 SNFs in 56 stars from 45607 frequencies in $\sim600$ $\gamma$ Doradus stars, corresponding to a fraction of approximately $0.67\%$ and $9.2\%$, respectively. Most SNFs are detected in the frequency range of pressure mode over 120 $\mu$Hz and the fraction of SNF detection increases as frequency up to $\sim7\%$. We barely found two potential SNFs mixed with gravity modes in two $\gamma$ Doradus stars. These findings indicate that SNFs have a negligible impact on the global seismic properties, such as those derived from period spacing in $\gamma$ Doradus stars. However, we stress that SNFs must be carefully and systematically examined by this method in other pulsating stars, particularly $\delta$ Scuti and hot B subdwarf stars, to establish a solid foundation for precise asteroseismolgy of various types of pulsators.

 Stellar evolution is driven by the changing composition of a star from nuclear reactions. At the late stages of evolution and during explosive events, the timescale can be short and drive strong hydrodynamic flows, making simulations of astrophysical reacting flows challenging. Over the past decades, the standard approach to modeling reactions in simulation codes has been operator splitting, using implicit integrators for reactions. Here we explore some of the assumptions in this standard approach and describe some techniques for improving the efficiency and accuracy of astrophysical reacting flows.

 - **Abstract**
 The gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057 consists of a Be star and an undetected compact object in a $\sim$317 day orbit. The interpretation of the emission from this system is complicated by the lack of a clear orbital solution, as two different and incompatible orbital solutions were obtained by previous radial velocity studies of this source. In order to address this, we report on 24 new observations, covering $\sim$60 per cent of the orbit which we have undertaken with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). We obtained new radial velocity measurements from cross-correlation of the narrower spectral features, and by fitting Voigt profiles to the wings of the Balmer emission lines. Additionally, we find an indication of orbital variability in the equivalent widths and V/R of the Balmer lines. Using the combined data from this study, as well as archival data from the earlier radial velocity studies, we have derived updated orbital solutions. Using reported H $\alpha$ emission radial velocities - previously not considered for the orbital solution - along with the new SALT data, a solution is obtained where the brighter peak in the X-ray and gamma-ray light curves is closer to periastron. However, continuing sparse coverage in the data around the expected phases of periastron indicates that the orbital solution could be improved with further observation.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae are a promising yet challenging target for detection due to the stochastic and complex nature of these signals. Conventional detection methods for core-collapse supernovae rely on excess energy searches because matched filtering has been hindered by the lack of well-defined waveform templates. However, numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae have improved our understanding of the gravitational wave signals they emit, which enables us, for the first time, to construct a set of templates that closely resemble predictions from numerical simulations. In this study, we investigate the possibility of detecting gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae using a matched-filtering methods. We construct a theoretically-informed template bank and use it to recover a core-collapse supernova signal injected into real LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector data. We evaluate the detection efficiency of the matched-filtering approach and how well the injected signal is reconstructed. We discuss the false alarm rate of our approach and investigate the main source of false triggers. We recover 88\% of the signals injected at a distance of 1 kpc and 50% of the signals injected at 2 kpc. For more than 50% of the recovered events, the underlying signal characteristics are reconstructed within an error of 15%. We discuss the strengths and limitations of this approach and identify areas for further improvements to advance the potential of matched filtering for supernova gravitational-wave detection. We also present the open-source Python package SynthGrav used to generate the template bank.

 - **Abstract**
 Consistent stellar evolution and nonlinear radial stellar pulsation calculations were carried out for models of asymptotic giant branch stars with initial masses $1.5M_\odot\le M_\mathrm{ZAMS}\le 3M_\odot$ and initial metal abundance $Z=0.006$. All the models are shown to be either the fundamental mode or the first overtone pulsators. The lower limit of the first overtone period increases with increasing mass of the Mira model from $\Pi_{1,\min}\approx 80$ days for $M=1.3M_\odot$ to $\Pi_{1,\min}\approx 120$ days for $M=2.6M_\odot$. The upper limit of the first overtone period and lower limit of the fundamental mode period depend on the stellar structure during mode switching and range from $\Pi_{1,\max}=130$, $\Pi_{0,\min}=190$ days for $M=0.96M_\odot$ to $\Pi_{1,\max}=210$, $\Pi_{0,\min}=430$ days for $M=2.2M_\odot$. The slope of the theoretical period--luminosity relation of Mira variables perceptibly increases with decreasing $Z$. Fourier spectra of the kinetic energy of twelve hydrodynamic models show a split of the fundamental mode maximum into several equidistant components. Frequency intervals between split components fall within the range $0.03 \le \Delta\nu/\nu_0 \le 0.1$. The superposition of radial oscillations with the fundamental mode splitting leads to the long-term amplitude variations with the cycle length from 10 to 30 times longer than the fundamental mode period. A more thorough analysis of hydrodynamic models is required for understanding the origin of the principal pulsation mode splitting.

          Measuring the expansion velocities of broad-line Ic supernovae: An investigation of neglected sources of error in two popular methods

 - **Abstract**
 The velocities of Ic-BL supernovae can be determined using two techniques (spline fitting and template fitting), sometimes resulting in different velocities for the same event. This work compares and contrasts both methods, identifying sources of error which are not accounted for by most authors and quantifying their impact on the final velocity measurement. Finally, it identifies the cause of velocity discrepancies for events measured using both methods. We quantified the impact of pre-smoothing the spectra prior to use of both methods using two well-sampled cases. To identify the source of velocity discrepancies, two cases were measured and directly compared. Additional sources of error for template fitting arise due to the choice of phase of the template spectrum ($\sim$1000 km/s) and smoothing of the input spectrum ($\sim$500 km/s). The impact of phase shifts is minimised at peak time. The spline fitting method tends to underestimate uncertainties by around 1000 km/s. This method can also be impacted by fine tuning of the smoothing parameters ($\sim$500-1000 km/s). Optimum smoothing parameters for different cases are presented along with suggestions for best practice. Direct comparison of both methods showed that velocity discrepancies are not always present, debunking the claim that the template fitting method always handles blending better than spline fitting. Spline fitting seems to struggle to handle blending only in cases where the Fe II features are superimposed on a red continuum, which biases the minimum of this feature towards the bluest line of the triplet, creating an artificially higher velocity. This situation may be relatively rare among Ic-BLs, based on typical temperature evolution. Both methods can be applied under certain circumstances with similar results. The morphology of the velocity evolution of an SN appears to be the same regardless of the method used.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma rays measured by the Fermi-LAT satellite tell us a lot about the processes taking place in high-energetic astrophysical objects. The fluxes coming from these objects are, however, extremely variable. Hence, gamma-ray light curves optimally use adaptive bin sizes in order to retrieve most information about the source dynamics and to combine gamma-ray observations in a multi-messenger perspective. However, standard adaptive binning approaches are slow, expensive and inaccurate in highly populated regions. Here, we present a novel, powerful, deep-learning-based approach to estimate the necessary time windows for adaptive binning light curves in Fermi-LAT data using raw photon data. The approach is shown to be fast and accurate. It can also be seen as a prototype to train machine-learning models for adaptive binning light curves for other astrophysical messengers.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations have revealed unique temperature profiles in hot Jupiter atmospheres. We propose that the energy transport by vertical mixing could lead to such thermal features. In our new scenario, strong absorbers, TiO and VO are not necessary. Vertical mixing could be naturally excited by atmospheric circulation or internal gravity wave breaking. We perform radiative transfer calculations by taking into account the vertical mixing driven energy transport. The radiative equilibrium (RE) is replaced by radiative-mixing equilibrium (RME). We investigate how the mixing strength, $K_{\rm zz}$, affects the atmospheric temperature-pressure profile. Strong mixing can heat the lower atmosphere and cool the upper atmosphere. This effect has important effects on the atmosphere thermal features that would form without mixing. In certain circumstances, it can induce temperature inversions in scenarios where the temperature monotonically increases with increasing pressure under conditions of lower thermal band opacity. Temperature inversions show up as $K_{\rm zz}$ increases with altitude due to shear interaction with the convection layer. The atmospheric thermal structure of HD~209458b can be well fitted with $K_{\rm zz} \propto (P/1\ {\rm bar})^{-1/2}\ {\rm cm}^{2} \ {\rm s}^{-1}$. Our findings suggest vertical mixing promotes temperature inversions and lowers $K_{\rm zz}$ estimates compared to prior studies. Incorporating chemical species into vertical mixing will significantly affect the thermal profile due to their temperature sensitivity.

 - **Abstract**
 Misaligned circumbinary disks will produce dust traffic jams during alignment or anti-alignment to the binary orbital plane. We conduct a hydrodynamical simulation of an initially misaligned circumbinary disk undergoing polar alignment with multiple dust species. Due to differential precession between the gas and dust components, multiple dust traffic jams are produced within the disk during polar alignment. The radial locations of the dust traffic jams depend on the Stokes number of the grains, which depends on grain size. We compute the dust temperature structure using post-processing radiative transfer to produce continuum images at cm-wavelengths. Multiple distinct rings emerge in the continuum images, corresponding to the dust traffic jams. The angular resolution of upcoming observations from SKA and ngVLA will be sufficient to detect centimeter-sized grains in protoplanetary disks and resolve the widths of dust traffic jams. Therefore, dust traffic jams resulting from the differential precession of gas and dust in misaligned circumbinary disks will be a prime target for more extended wavelength observations.

 - **Abstract**
 It is widely assumed that dust opacities in molecular clouds follow a power-law profile with an index, $\beta$. Recent studies of the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC) 2/3 complex, however, show a flattening in the spectral energy distribution (SED) at $ \lambda > 2$ mm implying non-constant indices on scales $\gtrsim$ 0.08 pc. The origin of this flattening is not yet known but it may be due to the intrinsic properties of the dust grains or contamination from other sources of emission. We investigate the SED slopes in OMC 2/3 further using observations of six protostellar cores with NOEMA from 2.9 mm to 3.6 mm and ALMA-ACA in Band 4 (1.9 -- 2.1 mm) and Band 5 (1.6 -- 1.8 mm) on core and envelope scales of $\sim 0.02 - 0.08$ pc. We confirm flattened opacity indices between 2.9 mm and 3.6 mm for the six cores with $\beta \approx -0.16 - 1.45$, which are notably lower than the $\beta$ values of $> 1.3$ measured for these sources on $0.08$ pc scales from single-dish data. Four sources have consistent SED slopes between the ALMA data and the NOEMA data. We propose that these sources may have a significant fraction of emission coming from large dust grains in embedded disks, which biases the emission more at longer wavelengths. Two sources, however, had inconsistent slopes between the ALMA and NOEMA data, indicating different origins of emission. These results highlight how care is needed when combining multi-scale observations or extrapolating single-band observations to other wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 Thermal changes in coronal loops are well-studied, both in quiescent active regions and in flaring scenarios. However, relatively little attention has been paid to loop emission in the hours before the onset of a solar flare; here, we present the findings of a study of over 50 off-limb flares of GOES class C5.0 and above. We investigated the integrated emission variability for Solar Dynamics Observatory Atmospheric Imaging Assembly channels 131, 171, 193, and 304 Ångstroms for 6 hours before each flare, and compared these quantities to the same time range and channels above active regions without proximal flaring. We find significantly increased emission variability in the 2-3 hours before flare onset, particularly for the 131 and 304 channels. This finding suggests a potential new flare prediction methodology. The emission trends between the channels are not consistently well-correlated, suggesting a somewhat chaotic thermal environment within the coronal portion of the loops that disturbs the commonly-observed heating and cooling cycles of quiescent active region loops. We present our approach, the resulting statistics, and discuss the implications for heating sources in these pre-flaring active regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the in-lab and on-sky performance for the upgraded 90 GHz focal plane of the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS), which had four of its seven detector wafers updated during the austral winter of 2022. The update aimed to improve the transition-edge-sensor (TES) stability and bias range and to realize the high optical efficiency of the sensor design. Modifications included revised circuit terminations, electrical contact between the TES superconductor and the normal metal providing the bulk of the bolometer's heat capacity, and additional filtering on the TES bias lines. The upgrade was successful: 94% of detectors are stable down to 15% of the normal resistance, providing a wide overlapping range of bias voltages for all TESs on a wafer. The median telescope efficiency improved from $0.42^{+0.15}_{-0.22}$ to $0.60^{+0.10}_{-0.32}$ (68% quantiles). For the four upgraded wafers alone, median telescope efficiency increased to $0.65^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$. Given our efficiency estimate for the receiver optics, this telescope efficiency implies a detector efficiency exceeding $0.90$. The overall noise-equivalent temperature of the 90 GHz focal plane improved from 19 $\mu$K$\sqrt{s}$ to 11.3 $\mu$K$\sqrt{s}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The atmospheres and surfaces of planets show tremendous amount of spatial variation, which has a direct effect on the spectrum of the object, even if this may not be spatially resolved. Here, we apply hyper realistic radiative simulations of Earth as an exoplanet comprising thousands of simulations and study the unresolved spectrum. The GlobES module on the Planetary Spectrum Generator was used, and we parameterized the atmosphere as described in the modern earth retrospective analysis for research and applications, MERRA2, database. The simulations were made into high spatial resolution images and compared to space based observations from the DSCOVR EPIC, at L1, and Himawari8, geostationary, satellites, confirming spatial variations and the spectral intensities of the simulations. The DSCOVR EPIC camera only functions in narrow wavelength bands, but strong agreement is demonstrated. It is shown that aerosols and small particles play an important role in defining Earths reflectance spectra, contributing significantly to its characteristic blue color. Subsequently, a comprehensive noise model is employed to constrain the exposure time required to detect O2, O3 and H2O as a function of varying ground and cloud cover for several concept observatories, including the habitable worlds observatory. Cloud coverage enhances the detectability of planets in reflected light, with important consequences for the design of the future HWO. The HWO concept would require between 3 to 10 times longer to observe the studied features than LUVOIR A but performs better than the HabEx without a starshade. The codes, routines, and the noise models are made publicly available.

          Starspots as an Explanation for the Mysterious IYJ Continuum Excess Emission in Classical T Tauri Stars

 - **Abstract**
 An accurate estimation of the continuum excess emission from accretion spots and inner circumstellar disk regions is crucial for a proper derivation of fundamental stellar parameters in accreting systems. However, the presence of starspots can make disentangling the complicated multi-component emission in these systems challenging. Subtraction of a single-temperature spectral template is insufficient to account for the composite stellar emission, as we demonstrated in a recent campaign involving Weak-Lined T Tauri Stars. Here, we model the moderate resolution near-infrared spectra of Classical T Tauri Stars, presenting new spectral models that incorporate spotted stars plus emission from accretion hot-spots and a warm inner disk, allowing us to simultaneously reconstruct the entire 0.8-2.4 micrometer spectrum of our sixteen targets. Using these models, we re-derive the continuum excess emission. Our results indicate that accounting for starspots resolves the need to include a previously proposed intermediate temperature component in the IYJ excess, and highlights the importance of a proper treatment of starspots in studies of accreting low-mass stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Empirical exoplanet mass-radius relations have been used to study the demographics and compositions of small exoplanets for many years. However, the heterogeneous nature of these measurements hinders robust statistical analysis of this population, particularly with regard to the masses of planets. For this reason, we perform a homogeneous and consistent re-analysis of the radial velocity (RV) observations of 85 small exoplanets using publicly available HARPS RV data and the fitting toolkit Pyaneti. For the entire sample, we run 12 different models to investigate the impact of modelling choices, including the use of multi-dimensional Gaussian Processes (GPs) to mitigate stellar activity. We find that the way orbital eccentricity is modelled can significantly impact the RV amplitude found in some cases. We also find that the addition of a GP to mitigate stellar activity does impact the RV amplitude found - though if the GP is modelled on activity indicators as well as the RVs the results are more robust. The RV amplitude found for every planet in our sample using all the models is made available for other groups to perform demographics studies. Finally, we provide a list of recommendations for the RV community moving forward.

          RR Lyrae Stars in Intermediate-age Magellanic Clusters: Membership Probabilities and Delay Time Distribution

 - **Abstract**
 Recent works have challenged our canonical view of RR Lyrae (RRL) stars as tracers of exclusively old populations ($\gtrsim10$~Gyr) by proposing a fraction of these stars to be of intermediate ages ($\sim$2-5~Gyr). Since it is currently not possible to infer stellar ages directly for individual RRL stars, our goal in this work is to search for these in association to intermediate-age clusters whose reliable ages can then be safely be attributed to the RRL. We used the Gaia DR3 Specific Object Study and OGLE IV public catalogues to search for RRL stars around stellar clusters older than 1~Gyr in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Modelling membership probabilities based on proper motion and photometric distance we obtained a list of 302 RRL stars associated with Magellanic clusters. Of these, 23 RRL are likely members of 10 intermediate-age clusters: 3 and 7 in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, respectively. By modelling the inferred expectation values of the number of RRL stars per cluster, we inferred the delay time distribution of the RRL in three age ranges. For the old population ($>8$~Gyr) we find $2.6^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ RRL$/10^5 M_\odot$. For the young (1-2 Gyr) and intermediate age (2-8 Gyr) populations we find rates of $0.9^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ and $0.27^{+0.1}_{-0.09}$ RRL$/10^5 M_\odot$, respectively. While radial velocities are necessary for definitively confirming cluster memberships, the high-probability list of intermediate-age RRL stars presented here offers a promising opportunity for the first direct confirmation of these enigmatic stars.
