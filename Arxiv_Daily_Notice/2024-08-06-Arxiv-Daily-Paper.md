          Accreting companion occurrence rates using a new method to compute emission-line survey sensitivity: Application to the H-alpha Giant Accreting Protoplanet Survey (GAPlanetS)

 - **Abstract**
 A key scientific goal of exoplanet surveys is to characterize the underlying population of planets in the local galaxy. In particular, the properties of accreting protoplanets can inform the rates and physical processes of planet formation. We develop a novel method to compute sensitivity to protoplanets in emission-line direct-imaging surveys, enabling estimates of protoplanet population properties under various planetary accretion and formation theories. In this work, we specialize to the case of H-alpha and investigate three formation models governing the planetary-mass-to-mass-accretion-rate power law, and two accretion models that describe the scaling between total accretion luminosity and observable H-alpha line luminosity. We apply our method to the results of the Magellan Giant Accreting Protoplanet Survey (GAPlanetS) to place the first constraints on accreting companion occurrence rates in systems with transitional circumstellar disks. We compute the posterior probability for transitional disk systems to host an accreting companion (-8< log MMdot MJ^2/yr < -2) within 2 arcseconds (~200 au). Across accretion models, we find consistent accreting companion rates, with median and one-sigma credible intervals of 0.15 (+0.18, -0.10) and 0.19 (+0.23, -0.12). Our technique enables studying protoplanet populations under flexible assumptions about planet formation. This formalism provides the statistical underpinning necessary for protoplanet surveys to discriminate among formation and accretion theories for planets and brown dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar streams that emerge from globular clusters (GCs) are thin stellar structures spread along the orbits of progenitor clusters. Numerical modeling of these streams is essential for understanding their interaction with the host galaxy's mass distribution. Traditional methods are either computationally expensive or oversimplified, motivating us to develop a fast and accurate approach using a particle spray algorithm. By conducting a series of N-body simulations of GCs orbiting a host galaxy, we find that the position and velocity distributions of newly-escaped stream particles are consistent across various GC masses and orbital parameters. Based on these distributions, we develop a new algorithm that avoids computing the detailed internal cluster dynamics by directly drawing tracer particles from these distributions. This algorithm correctly reproduces the action space distribution of stream particles and achieves a 10% accuracy in stream morphology and velocities compared to N-body simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The exponential growth of astronomical literature poses significant challenges for researchers navigating and synthesizing general insights or even domain-specific knowledge. We present Pathfinder, a machine learning framework designed to enable literature review and knowledge discovery in astronomy, focusing on semantic searching with natural language instead of syntactic searches with keywords. Utilizing state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) and a corpus of 350,000 peer-reviewed papers from the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), Pathfinder offers an innovative approach to scientific inquiry and literature exploration. Our framework couples advanced retrieval techniques with LLM-based synthesis to search astronomical literature by semantic context as a complement to currently existing methods that use keywords or citation graphs. It addresses complexities of jargon, named entities, and temporal aspects through time-based and citation-based weighting schemes. We demonstrate the tool's versatility through case studies, showcasing its application in various research scenarios. The system's performance is evaluated using custom benchmarks, including single-paper and multi-paper tasks. Beyond literature review, Pathfinder offers unique capabilities for reformatting answers in ways that are accessible to various audiences (e.g. in a different language or as simplified text), visualizing research landscapes, and tracking the impact of observatories and methodologies. This tool represents a significant advancement in applying AI to astronomical research, aiding researchers at all career stages in navigating modern astronomy literature.

 - **Abstract**
 We explores the Pantheon+SH0ES dataset to identify patterns that can discriminate between different cosmological models. We focus on determining whether the behaviour of dark energy is consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model or suggests novel cosmological features. The central goal is to evaluate the robustness of the $\Lambda$CDM model compared with other dark energy models, and to investigate whether there are deviations that might indicate new cosmological insights. The study takes into account a data-driven approach, using both traditional statistical methods and machine learning techniques. Initially, we evaluate six different dark energy models using traditional statistical methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Static and Dynamic Nested Sampling to infer the cosmological parameters. Subsequently, we adopt a machine learning approach, developing a regression model to compute the distance modulus of each supernova, expanding the feature set to 74 statistical features. Traditional statistical analysis confirms that the $\Lambda$CDM model is robust, yielding expected parameter values. Other models show deviations, with the Generalised and Modified Chaplygin Gas models performing poorly. In the machine learning analysis, feature selection techniques, particularly Boruta, significantly improve model performance. In particular, models initially considered weak (Generalised/Modified Chaplygin Gas) show significant improvement after feature selection. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of a data-driven approach to cosmological model evaluation. The $\Lambda$CDM model remains robust, while machine learning techniques, in particular feature selection, reveal potential improvements in alternative models which could be relevant for new observational campaigns like the recent DESI survey.

          Gravitational collapse at low to moderate Mach numbers: The relationship between star formation efficiency and the fraction of mass in the massive object

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of massive objects via gravitational collapse is relevant both for explaining the origin of the first supermassive black holes and in the context of massive star formation. Here, we analyze simulations of the formation of massive objects pursued by different groups and in various environments, concerning the formation of supermassive black holes, primordial stars, as well as present-day massive stars. We focus particularly on the regime of small virial parameters, i.e., low ratios of the initial kinetic to gravitational energy, low to moderate Mach numbers, and the phase before feedback is very efficient. We compare the outcomes of collapse under different conditions using dimensionless parameters, particularly the star formation efficiency \epsilon_*, the fraction f_* of mass in the most massive object relative to the total stellar mass, and the fraction f_{\rm tot} of mass of the most massive object as a function of the total mass. We find that in all simulations analyzed here, f_{\rm tot} increases as a function of \epsilon_*, although the steepness of the increase depends on the environment. The relation between f_* and \epsilon_* is found to be more complex and also strongly depends on the number of protostars present at the beginning of the simulations. We show that a collision parameter, estimated as the ratio of the system size divided by the typical collision length, allows us to approximately characterize whether collisions will be important. We analyze the statistical correlation between the dimensionless quantities using the Spearman coefficient and confirm via a machine learning analysis that good predictions of f_* can be obtained from \epsilon_* together with a rough estimate of the collision parameter. This suggests that a good estimate of the mass of the most massive object can be obtained once the maximum efficiency for a given environment is known.

 - **Abstract**
 Comets, relics from the early solar system, consist of dust and ice. The ice sublimates as comets approach the Sun, ejecting dust from their nuclei seen as activity. Different volatiles sublimate at different Sun-comet distances and eject dust of unique sizes, structures, and compositions. In this study, we present new polarimetric observations of Oort-cloud comet C/2017 K2 (PANSTARRS) in R and I-filter domains before, during, and after its crossover of the water-ice sublimation regime at phase angles of 15.9\arcdeg, 10.5\arcdeg, and 20.0\arcdeg, respectively. Combining multiband optical imaging data covering a wide range of heliocentric distances ($\sim$14$-$2.3 au), we aim to characterize the preperihelion evolution of cometary activity as well as the properties of its coma dust. Two discontinuous brightening events were observed: at $\sim$6 au presumably associated with changes in CO-like supervolatile ice activity, and at $\sim$2.9 au when water ice took over. Particularly, the latter activation is accompanied by changes in coma morphology and color whose trends differ between the inner ($\sim$10$^3$-km) and outer ($\sim$10$^4$-km) parts of the coma. No polarimetric discontinuities on the comet were observed over the inner coma region, all epochs showing phase-angle and wavelength dependencies compatible with those of active comets observed in similar observing geometry. During this period, the underlying dust continuum overwhelmed H$\alpha$ emission at around 656.3 nm, suggesting less water ice on the comet's surface than expected. We discuss K2's coma environment by combining numerical simulations of light scattered by dust and place the observations within the context of the comet's evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the linear cosmological perturbations in the context of the so-called energy-momentum squared gravity (EMSG) theory. Recent researches show that the EMSG theory can reproduce viable background cosmological evolution comparable to $\Lambda$CDM, while the matter-dominated era exhibits slight distinctions. In this paper, we mainly focus on the power-law EMSG models and derive the equations for the linear cosmological perturbations. We explore the propagation of the gravitational wave (GW) and the growth of matter density perturbation at the first order, and estimate the model parameters from the simulated GW data and the observed redshift space distortion data. Our analysis reveals that the model parameters should be small and positive in $1\sigma$ confidence interval, which indicates that the theory is in good agreement with the observational data and can be regarded as an alternative for the standard cosmological model.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations results reported by {\it Planck} satellite suggest a plateau characteristic in the flat potential of the inflaton field is favored to drive the Universe's early acceleration. On that note, Power Law Plateau (PLP) potential has gained a lot of attention. In this study, we demonstrate that implementing this inflationary model in an Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet(EGB) gravity background makes the model compatible with observations while avoiding late-stage thermal inflation which is otherwise unavoidable in a standard scenario. More importantly, we have taken the PLP model as a case study to check the new slow-roll approximations method proposed in \cite{Pozdeeva:2024ihc}. Then we take one step further to check the consequence of generalized reheating in this scenario. Thus opening a new promising window to study inflationary dynamics in EGB gravity.

          Streaming Torque in Dust-Gas Coupled Protoplanetary Disks

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the migration of low-mass protoplanets embedded in dust-gas coupled protoplanetary disks. Linear calculations are performed with respect to the NSH (Nakagawa-Sekiya-Hayashi 1986) equilibrium within a shearing sheet. We find that the dusty quasi-drift mode dominates the dynamical behaviors in close proximity to the protoplanet. This mode exhibits an extremely short radial wavelength, characterized by a dispersion relation of $ \tilde{\omega} = \left( 1 + \mu \right) \boldsymbol{W}_s \cdot \boldsymbol{k}$. The emergence of this mode leads to a wake with a short radial length-scale ahead of protoplanets, contributing to a positive torque, termed as ``Streaming Torque (ST)''. Furthermore, both Lindblad torque and corotation torque are affected by the NSH velocity. The total torque and planetary migration are contingent upon the coupling strength between dust and gas. In most scenarios, ST predominates, inducing outward migration for planets, thereby addressing the issue of rapid inward migration in their formation paradigm.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring the properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and sources during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is of immense importance. We explore the prospects of probing the IGM and sources through redshifted 21-cm observations of individual ionized bubbles surrounding known luminous sources during the EoR. Accordingly, we simulate HI 21-cm maps, foreground contaminants and system noise which are specific to the uGMRT and SKA1-Low observations. Following the subtraction of the foreground from the total visibility, we employ a visibility-based matched filter technique to optimally combine the desired HI 21-cm signal while minimizing the system noise. Our analysis suggests that these ionized bubbles can be detected with more than $5 \sigma$ significance using approximately $\sim 2000$ and $\sim 3000$ hours of observation time with the uGMRT at redshift $7.1$ and $8.3$ respectively. The SKA1-Low should be able to detect these with more than $8 \sigma$ significance using just $\sim 100$ hrs of observations. Further, we investigate the impact of the foreground subtraction on the detectability and find the signal-to-noise ratio decreases when smaller bandwidth is used. More importantly, we show that the matched filtering method can measure ionized bubble radius and constrain HI-neutral fraction reasonably well, helping deeper insights into source properties and the intergalactic medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the discovery of cosmic rays (CRs) over a century ago, their origin has remained a mystery and a key research question. Recently, the LHAASO experiment identified the first CR super-acceleration source, the Cygnus bubble, which can accelerate CRs to energies exceeding 10 PeV. A pertinent question is: how much does the Cygnus bubble contribute to the CR spectrum observed on Earth? With the aim of answering that question, a 3D propagation analysis was conducted on CRs in this study. The Cygnus bubble was incorporated into our propagation model in order to determine its contributions to the observed spectra. First, we calculated the spectrum and spatial morphology of the Cygnus bubble to reproduce the observed LHAASO data. Subsequently, we calculated the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emissions produced by the CRs from the Cygnus bubble and the energy spectrum of the cosmic ray particles near Earth after propagation. Finally, we utilized a CR spatial-dependent propagation model to calculate the large-scale CR energy spectrum and the resulting diffuse $\gamma$-ray emissions. Our results indicate that: (1) the Cygnus bubble contributes minimally to the CR spectrum observed on Earth, (2) the emissions produced by the CR particles from the Cygnus bubble dominates the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emissions in that region, (3) the structural fluctuations of the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emissions observed by LHAASO are likely due to the local CR halo. We anticipate that LHAASO will identify more CR halo sources to validate our model.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of the velocity dispersion indicate a severe dark matter (DM) deficit in the ultra-diffuse galaxy, NGC1052-DF4 (DF4). The ultra-deep images obtained with the Gemini telescope, which has the deepest imaging data till now, confirm the presence of tidal tails in DF4, suggesting its tidal formation. To enhance tidal effects, we consider the self-interaction among DM particles. Using an N-body simulation in the scenario of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), we reproduce a DM-deficient galaxy that is consistent with all observational data of DF4. Specifically, our simulation result yields an extremely low DM-to-star mass ratio and a radial surface brightness profile very similar to that from deep images, showing accurate tidal features. By performing simulations with similar tidal effects and various cross-sections of SIDM, we show a significant impact of SIDM on the DM-to-star mass ratio in the central region of the galaxy. Our work confirms the tidal formation of DF4 in theory.

          Chromo-natural inflation supported by enhanced friction from Horndeski gravity

 - **Abstract**
 We study the extension of the chromo-natural inflation model by incorporating nonminimal coupling between the axion field and gravity. Nonminimal coupling is introduced so that it enhances friction in the axion's equation of motion and thus supports slow-roll inflation. This enhanced friction effectively delays the activation of the gauge field, thereby preventing the overproduction of gravitational waves in the CMB scale. We extend previous results by describing the nonminimal coupling in a general and unifying way utilizing Horndeski gravity. This allows us to explore systematically and comprehensively possible enhanced friction models of chromo-natural inflation consistent with observations. We find a novel enhanced friction model that shows better agreement (within 1$\sigma$) with CMB measurements than the previous nonminimally coupled chromo-natural inflation model. The gravitational-wave spectrum starts to rise at some wavenumber due to retarded activation of the gauge field in the late stage of inflation. We show how one can identify the wavenumber at which this occurs based on the background evolution and present a universal analytic formula for the gravitational-wave spectrum that can be used for any enhanced friction model of chromo-natural inflation.

 - **Abstract**
 In this review, a pedagogical introduction to the concepts of slow-roll inflationary Universe and number of $e$-folds is provided. In particular, the differences between the basic notion of number of $e$-folds ($N_e$), total number of $e$-folds ($N_T$) and number of $e$-folds before the end of inflation ($N$), are outlined. The proper application of the number of $e$-folds before the end of inflation is discussed both as a time-like variable for the scalar field evolution and as a key parameter for computing inflationary predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 V5579 Sgr was a fast nova discovered in 2008 April 18.784 UT. We present the optical spectroscopic observations of the nova observed from the Castanet Tolosan, SMARTS and CTIO observatories spanning over 2008 April 23 to 2015 May 11. The spectra are dominated by hydrogen Balmer, Fe II and O I lines with P-Cygni profiles in the early phase, typical of an Fe II class nova. The spectra show He I and He II lines along with forbidden lines from N, Ar, S, and O in the nebular phase. The nova showed a pronounced dust formation episode that began about 20 days after the outburst. The dust temperature and mass were estimated using the WISE data from spectral energy distribution (SED) fits. The PAH-like features are also seen in the nova ejecta in the mid-IR Gemini spectra taken 522 d after the discovery. Analysis of the light curve indicates values of t$_2$ and t$_3$ about 9 and 13 days, respectively, placing the nova in the category of fast nova. The best fit cloudy model of the early decline phase JHK spectra obtained on 2008 May 3 and the nebular optical spectrum obtained on 2011 June 2 shows a hot white dwarf source with T$_{BB}$ $\sim$ 2.6 $\times$ 10$^5$ K having a luminosity of 9.8 $\times$ 10$^{36}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. Our abundance analysis shows that the ejecta is significantly enhanced relative to solar, O/H = 32.2, C/H = 15.5 and N/H = 40.0 in the early decline phase and O/H = 5.8, He/H = 1.5 and N/H = 22.0 in the nebular phase.

 - **Abstract**
 The Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope (LST) on board the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) is the first payload to image the full solar disk and the solar corona in both white-light (WL) and ultraviolet (UV) H I Lya, extending up to 2.5 solar radii (Rs). Since the launch of the ASO-S on 9 October 2022, LST has captured various significant solar activities including flares, prominences, coronal mass ejections (CMEs). LST covers different passbands of 121.6 nm, 360 nm and 700 nm. The Lya Solar Disk Imager (SDI) has a field of view (FOV) of 38.4 arcmin and a spatial resolution of around 9.5 arcsec, while the White-Light Solar Telescope (WST) has a FOV of 38.43 arcmin and a spatial resolution of around 3.0 arcsec. The FOV of the Lya Solar Corona Imager (SCI) reaches 81.1 arcmin and its spatial resolution is 4.3 arcsec. The stray-light level in the 700 nm waveband is about 7.8e-6 MSB (mean solar brightness) at 1.1 Rs and 7.6e-7 MSB at 2.5 Rs, and in the Lya waveband it is around 4.3e-3 MSB at 1.1 Rs and 4.1e-4 MSB at 2.5 Rs. This article will detail the results from on-orbit tests and calibrations.

          The TRAPUM Small Magellanic Cloud pulsar survey with MeerKAT -- II. Nine new radio timing solutions and glitches from young pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 We report new radio timing solutions from a three-year observing campaign conducted with the MeerKAT and Murriyang telescopes for nine Small Magellanic Cloud pulsars, increasing the number of characterised rotation-powered extragalactic pulsars by 40 per cent. We can infer from our determined parameters that the pulsars are seemingly all isolated, that six are ordinary pulsars, and that three of the recent MeerKAT discoveries have a young characteristic age of under 100 kyr and have undergone a spin-up glitch. Two of the sources, PSRs J0040$-$7337 and J0048$-$7317, are energetic young pulsars with spin-down luminosities of the order of 10$^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. They both experienced a large glitch, with a change in frequency of about 30 $\mu$Hz, and a frequency derivative change of order $-10^{-14}$ Hz s$^{-1}$. These glitches, the inferred glitch rate, and the properties of these pulsars (including potentially high inter-glitch braking indices) suggest these neutron stars might be Vela-like repeating glitchers and should be closely monitored in the future. The position and energetics of PSR J0048$-$7317 confirm it is powering a new Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN) detected as a radio continuum source; and similarly the association of PSR J0040$-$7337 with the PWN of Supernova Remnant (SNR) DEM S5 (for which we present a new Chandra image) is strengthened. Finally, PSR J0040$-$7335 is also contained within the same SNR but is a chance superposition. It has also been seen to glitch with a change of frequency of $10^{-2}$ $\mu$Hz. This work more than doubles the characterised population of SMC radio pulsars.

          Mitigating Astrophysical Uncertainties in 21-cm Cosmology

 - **Abstract**
 The light of the first astrophysical objects is expected to leave an imprint on the global 21-cm signal as it heats, excites, and ionizes neutral hydrogen. This dependence on early astrophysics introduces significant uncertainties in modeling the 21-cm signal during Cosmic Dawn (CD). Here we show that a combination of observables including high-redshift UV luminosity functions, the cosmic X-ray background, the optical depth to reionization, and hydrogen absorption lines in quasar spectra, can be used to mitigate the astrophysical uncertainties assuming minimal modeling. Beyond its implications to standard astrophysics, we demonstrate how applying this procedure can improve sensitivity to new physics signatures in the global 21-cm signal. Taking the scenario of fractional millicharged dark matter (DM) as an example, we address astrophysical systematics to produce interesting predictions for upcoming experiments.

 The first LHAASO catalog presents six mysterious Ultra-High-Energy (UHE) $\gamma$-ray sources -- 1LHAASO J0007$+$5659u, 1LHAASO J0206$+$4302u, 1LHAASO J0212$+$4254u, 1LHAASO J0216$+$4237u, 1LHAASO J1740$+$0948u and 1LHAASO J1959$+$1129u, which have emission only detected by LHAASO-KM2A (energy $>$ 25 TeV). No significant counterparts of these six sources are observed, except the two pulsars PSR J0218$+$4232 and PSR J1740$+$1000. All the six sources are out of Galactic plane with galactic latitudes (absolute value) over 5$^{\circ}$. Three of them -- 1LHAASO J0206$+$4302u, 1LHAASO J0212$+$4254u and 1LHAASO J0216$+$4237u are connected on the significance map and forming a dumbbell-like structure. They are close in position and show a similar spectral shape, suggesting a physical association among them. In this work, we first present a multi-wavelength and multi-messenger study of these six sources based on the Fermi-LAT, Swift-XRT, Planck and LAMBDA datasets as well as the data of IceCube. The corresponding leptonic and hadronic modeling results are also provided. To explain the interesting dumbbell-like structure, we established a traveling Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN) model. Our model has the ability to explain both the morphology and spectrum of KM2A. However, both a high proper-motion speed $>$ 1000 km s$^{-1}$ and a short distance $<$ 1 kpc are required in our model, which contradict the parameters of the only known nearby pulsar - PSR J0218+4232. For more detailed researches on this structure, we intend to utilize XMM-Newton to acquire X-ray data with higher sensitivity.

 - **Abstract**
 The Baade-Wesselink method allows us to estimate distances to individual pulsating stars. Accurate geometric parallaxes obtained by the Gaia mission serve us in the calibration of the method and in the determination of its precision. The method also provides a way of determining mean radii of pulsating stars. The main aim of this work is to determine the scatter and possible dependence of p- factors of RR Lyrae stars on their pulsation periods. The secondary objective is to determine mean radius - period relations for these stars. Our calibrations for RR Lyrae stars are based on photometric data gathered at the Cerro Murphy Observatory. We obtained spectroscopic data specifically for this project using high resolution spectrographs. We use the Infrared Surface Brightness (IRSB) version of the method that relies on a surface brightness - color relation dependent on the (V-K) color. We obtain the spread of p- factors of around 0.07-0.08 for our sample of 9 RR Lyrae stars from the solar neighborhood. However, we also find relations between the p-factor and the pulsation period for RRab stars with the rms scatter around the relation of around 0.05, but with relatively large uncertainty of relations' parameters. We present relations between the mean radius and period for RR Lyrae pulsating in the fundamental mode with the rms scatter around the relation of $0.012R_{\odot}$. We observe a clear offset between p- factors obtained using the IRSB technique (with mean p between 1.39 and 1.45) and values inferred by Bras et al. (2024) using the SPIPS tool (Mérand et al. 2015). On the other hand, we obtain a similar scatter of p of as observed by Bras et al. (2024). Our period-radius relations are in a good agreement with both the inference of Bras et al. (2024) based on SPIPS and theoretical predictions of Marconi et al. (2005, 2015)

 - **Abstract**
 This study analyzed the Doppler shift in the solar spectrum using the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). Two types of oscillations were investigated: long period damp and short period damp. The researchers observed periodic perturbations in the Doppler velocity oscillations of bright points (BPs) in the chromosphere and transition region (TR). Deep learning techniques were used to examine the statistical properties of damping in different solar regions. The results showed variations in damping rates, with higher damping in coronal hole areas. The study provided insights into the damping behavior of BPs and contributed to our understanding of energy dissipation processes in the solar chromosphere and TR.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a full-size engineering model of GALI - The GAmma-ray burst Localizing Instrument, composed of 362 CsI(Tl) small cubic scintillators, distributed within a small volume of $\sim2$l, and read out by silicon photo-multipliers. GALI can provide directional information about GRBs with high angular accuracy from angle-dependent mutual obstruction between its scintillators. Here, we demonstrate GALI's laboratory experiments with an $^{241}$Am source, which achieved directional reconstruction of $<$3$^\circ$ accuracy, in agreement with our Monte-Carlo simulations. GALI has a wide field view of the unobstructed sky. With its current cubic configuration, GALI's effective area varies between 97 cm$^2$ (face on) and 138 cm$^2$ (from the corners at 45$^\circ$), which is verified in the current experiment.

 - **Abstract**
 HIP94235 b, a 120 Myr old sub-Neptune, provides us the unique opportunity to study mass loss at a pivotal stage of the system's evolution: the end of a 100 million year (Myr) old phase of intense XUV irradiation. We present two observations of HIP94235 b using the Hubble Space Telescope's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (HST/STIS) in the Ly-alpha wavelength region. We do not observe discernible differences across either the blue and red wings of the Ly-alpha line profile in and out of transit, and report no significant detection of outflowing neutral hydrogen around the planet. We constrain the rate of neutral hydrogen escaping HIP94235 b to an upper limit of 10^13 g/s, which remains consistent with energy-limited model predictions of 10^11 g/s. The Ly-alpha non-detection is likely due to the extremely short photoionization timescale of the neutral hydrogen escaping the planet's atmosphere. This timescale, approximately 15 minutes, is significantly shorter than that of any other planets with STIS observations. Through energy-limited mass loss models, we anticipate that HIP94235 b will transition into a super-Earth within a timescale of 1 Gyr.

 We present a catalog of stellar parameters (effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$, surface gravity $\log g$, age, and metallicity [Fe/H]) and elemental-abundance ratios ([C/Fe], [Mg/Fe], and [$\alpha$/Fe]) for some five million stars (4.5 million dwarfs and 0.5 million giants stars) in the Milky Way, based on stellar colors from the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) DR3 and \textit{Gaia} EDR3. These estimates are obtained through the construction of a large spectroscopic training set with parameters and abundances adjusted to uniform scales, and trained with a Kernel Principal Component Analysis. Owing to the seven narrow/medium-band filters employed by J-PLUS, we obtain precisions in the abundance estimates that are as good or better than derived from medium-resolution spectroscopy for stars covering a wide range of the parameter space: 0.10-0.20 dex for [Fe/H] and [C/Fe], and 0.05 dex for [Mg/Fe] and [$\alpha$/Fe]. Moreover, systematic errors due to the influence of molecular carbon bands on previous photometric-metallicity estimates (which only included two narrow/medium-band blue filters) have now been removed, resulting in photometric-metallicity estimates down to [Fe/H] $\sim -4.0$, with typical uncertainties of 0.25 dex and 0.40 dex for dwarfs and giants, respectively. This large photometric sample should prove useful for the exploration of the assembly and chemical-evolution history of our Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The statistical properties of energy and waiting time carry essential information about the source of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs). In this paper, we investigate the randomness of energy and waiting time using four data samples from three extremely active repeating FRBs observed by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). We report the deviation from complete randomness of the burst activity using three statistics, i.e., Hurst exponent, Pincus index and non-Gaussian probability density distribution of fluctuations. First, the Hurst exponent greater than 0.5 reveals that there is long-term memory in the time series of energy and waiting time. Second, the deviation of the Pincus index from 1.0 manifests that the time series is not completely random. Finally, the fluctuations of energy and waiting time follow the scale-invariant $q$-Gaussian distribution. All these statistical properties imply that, although the time series of repeating FRBs seems to be irregular, they are not completely random, similar to the features of self-organized criticality.

          Role of thermal conduction in relativistic hot accretion flow around rotating black hole with shock

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the properties of low angular momentum, relativistic, viscous, advective accretion flows around rotating black holes that include shock waves in the presence of thermal conduction. We self-consistently solve the governing fluid equations to obtain the global transonic accretion solutions for a set of model parameters, namely energy ($\mathcal{E}$), angular momentum ($\lambda$), viscosity ($\alpha$), conduction parameter ($\Phi_{\rm s}$) and cooling parameter ($f_{\rm c}$). We observe that depending on the model parameters, accretion flow experiences centrifugally supported shock transition and the present study, for the first time, focuses on examining the shock properties, such as shock radius ($r_{\rm s}$), compression ratio ($R$) and shock strength ($\Psi$) regulated by the dissipation parameters ($\Phi_{\rm s},~f_{\rm c}$). We show that shock-induced global accretion solutions persist for wide range of model parameters and identify the boundary of the parameter space in energy-angular momentum plane that admits standing shocks for different dissipation parameters ($\Phi_{\rm s},~f_{\rm c}$). Finally, we compute the critical conduction parameter ($\Phi_{\rm s}^{\rm cri}$), beyond which shock ceases to exist. We find that $\Phi_{\rm s}^{\rm cri}$ directly depends on the black hole spin ($a_{\rm k}$) with $\Phi_{\rm s}^{\rm cri} \sim 0.029$ and $\sim 0.04$ for weakly ($a_{\rm k}\rightarrow 0$) and rapidly ($a_{\rm k}\rightarrow 1$) rotating black hole. Furthermore, we observe that $\Phi_{\rm s}^{\rm cri}$ decreases with increasing viscosity ($\alpha$), and shocked accretion solutions continue to exist for $\alpha \lesssim 0.065$ ($a_{\rm k} \rightarrow 0$) and $\lesssim 0.104$ ($a_{\rm k} \rightarrow 1$), respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the spectro-polarimetric results obtained from simultaneous X-ray observations with IXPE, NuSTAR and NICER of the dipping neutron star X-ray binary 4U 1624-49. This source is the most polarized Atoll source so far observed with IXPE, with a polarization degree of 2.7% $\pm$ 0.9% in the 2-8 keV band during the non-dip phase and marginal evidence of an increasing trend with energy. The higher polarization degree compared to other Atolls can be explained by the high inclination of the system ($i \approx 60$°). The spectra are well described by the combination of a soft thermal emission, a Comptonized component, plus reflection of soft photons off the accretion disk. During the dips, the hydrogen column density of the highly-ionized absorber increases while the ionization state decreases. The Comptonized radiation seems to be the dominant contribution to the polarized signal, with additional reflected photons which significantly contribute even if their fraction in the total flux is not high.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun drives a supersonic wind which inflates a giant plasma bubble in our very local interstellar neighborhood, the heliosphere. It is bathed in an extremely variable background of energetic ions and electrons which originate from a number of sources. Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are accelerated in the vicinity of the Sun, whereas shocks driven by solar disturbances are observed to accelerate energetic storm particles (ESPs). Moreover, a dilute population with a distinct composition forms the anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs) which are of a mixed interstellar-heliospheric origin. Particles are also accelerated at planetary bow shocks. We will present recent observations of energetic particles by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe, as well as other spacecraft that allow us to study the acceleration and transport of energetic particles at multiple locations in the inner heliosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 The Rosetta spacecraft accompanied the comet 67P/C-G for nearly 2 years, collecting valuable data on the neutral and ion composition of the coma. The Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC) provided continuous measurements of the in situ plasma density while ROSINA-COPS monitored the neutral composition. In this work, we aim to estimate the composition of the cometary ionosphere at different heliocentric distances of the comet. Lauter et al. (2020) derived the temporal evolution of the volatile sublimation rates for 50 separated time intervals on the orbit of 67P/C-G using the COPS and DFMS data. We use these sublimation rates as inputs in a multifluid chemical-hydrodynamical model for 36 of the time intervals for heliocentric distances < 3 au. We compare the total ion densities obtained from our models with the local plasma density measured by the RPC instruments. We find that at the location of the spacecraft, our modeled ion densities match with the in situ measured plasma density within factors of 1 - 3 for many of the time intervals. We obtain the cometocentric distance variation of the ions H2O+ and H3O+ and the ion groups created respectively by the ionization and protonation of neutral species. We see that H3O+ is dominant at the spacecraft location for nearly all the time intervals while ions created due to protonation are dominant at low cometocentric distances for the intervals near perihelion. We also discuss our ion densities in the context of their detection by DFMS.

 - **Abstract**
 Using lattice field simulations of the Abelian-Higgs model, we characterize the simultaneous emission of (scalar and gauge) particles and gravitational waves (GWs) by local string loops. We use {\it network} loops created in a phase transition, and {\it artificial} loops formed by either crossing straight-boosted or curved-static infinite strings. Loops decay via both particle and GW emission, on time scales $\Delta t_{\rm dec} \propto L^p$, where $L$ is the loop length. For particle production, we find $p \simeq 2$ for artificial loops and $p \lesssim 1$ for network loops, whilst for GW emission, we find $p \simeq 1$ for all loops. We find that below a critical length, artificial loops decay primarily through particle production, whilst for larger loops GW emission dominates. However, for network loops, which represent more realistic configurations, particle emission always dominates, as supported by our data with length-to-core ratios up to $L/r_\text{c} \lesssim 3500$. Our results indicate that the GW background from a local string network should be greatly suppressed compared to estimations that ignore particle emission.

          Non-parametric late-time expansion history reconstruction and implications for the Hubble tension in light of DESI

 - **Abstract**
 We non-parametrically reconstruct the late-time expansion history in light of the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI combined with various Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) catalogs, using interpolation through piece-wise natural cubic splines, and a reconstruction procedure based on Gaussian Processes (GPs). Applied to DESI BAO and PantheonPlus SNeIa data, both methods indicate that deviations from a reference $\Lambda$CDM model in the $z \lesssim 2$ unnormalized expansion rate $E(z)$ are constrained to be $\lesssim 10\%$, but also consistently identify two features in $E(z)$: a bump at $z \sim 0.5$, and a depression at $z \sim 0.9$, which cannot be simultaneously captured by a $w_0w_a$CDM fit. These features, which are stable against assumptions regarding spatial curvature, interpolation knots, and GP kernel, disappear if one adopts the older SDSS BAO measurements in place of DESI, and decrease in significance when replacing the PantheonPlus catalog with the Union3 and DESY5 ones. We infer $c/(r_dH_0)=29.90 \pm 0.33$ (with $r_d$ the sound horizon at baryon drag), which slightly reduces the Hubble tension and makes room for a more important role of late-time new physics in this context, albeit still remaining a sub-dominant part of the solution. If substantiated in forthcoming data releases, our results tentatively point to oscillatory/non-monotonic features in the shape of the expansion rate at $z \lesssim 2$, of potential interest for dark energy model-building.

 - **Abstract**
 We present analyses of Suzaku XIS light curves and spectra of the BL Lac object OJ 287 with observations positioned primarily around proposed recurrent optical outbursts. The first two observations were performed in 2007 April 10 - 13 (epoch 1) and 2007 November 7 - 9 (epoch 2) that respectively correspond to a low and a high optical state and which, within the binary supermassive black hole model for OJ 287, precede and follow the impact flare. The last three observations, made consecutively during 2015 May 3 - 9 (epoch 3), were during the post-impact state of the 2013 disc impact and are the longest continuous X-ray observation of OJ 287 taken before the optical outburst in 2015 December. Intraday variability is found in both the soft (0.5 - 2 keV) and hard (2 - 10 keV) bands. The discrete correction function analysis of the light curves in both bands peaks at zero lag during epochs 2 and 3, indicating that the emission in both bands was cospatial and emitted from the same population of leptons. Power spectral densities of all three light curves are red noise dominated, with a rather wide range of power spectrum slopes. These X-ray spectra are overall consistent with power-laws but with significantly different spectral indices. In the 2015 observations the X-ray spectrum softens during the flare, showing an obvious soft X-ray excess that was not evident in the 2007 observations. We discuss the implications of these observations on the jet, the possible accretion disc, and the binary supermassive black hole model proposed for the nearly periodic optical flaring of OJ 287.

 - **Abstract**
 The optical line and continuum emission in the very high ionization Galactic planetary nebula (PN) NGC 4361 (PN G294.1 +43.6), has been mapped with VLT MUSE Wide Field normal mode (4750-9300A) commissioning observations. The PN is larger than a single MUSE field and only the central 1 arcmin square was observed in good conditions. Images in recombination and collisionally excited emission lines were extracted and line ratios provide dust extinction, electron density and temperature and ionic abundances. The nebula is confirmed as optically thin in the H-ionizing continuum based on its very low He I emission, even to the edges of the field, but is not completely optically thin. The electron temperature Te is shown to have large-scale spatially coherent structure, as indicated from previous spectra. Prior to this study, no low ionization emission had been positively detected; MUSE revealed both weak extended [N II] and [O II] and $>$100 spatially unresolved low ionization knots (dubbed 'Freckles'). There are several linear associations of the Freckles but none point back convincingly to the central star. The Freckle spectra show low-moderate ionization with Te $\sim$11000 K, Ne $\sim$1500 cm$^{-3}$ and higher extinction than the highly ionized medium, but do not clearly differ in (He, N, O, S) abundance with respect to the extended gas. The spatial distribution and radial velocities suggest that the Freckles belong to a thick disk oriented perpendicular to the large-scale nebula, perhaps remnants of an earlier structure. Within the MUSE field, a low redshift emission line galaxy was serendipitously found hiding behind NGC 4361. The spectrum of this dwarf galaxy was extracted from the bright foreground nebular emission: it is a low luminosity disk galaxy at $\sim$87 Mpc with bright H II regions (12+log(O/H) $\sim$ 8.4), probably a Magellanic irregular or low-mass spiral.

 - **Abstract**
 General relativistic effects are strong near the black hole of an X-ray binary and significantly impact the total energy released at the innermost accretion disk's region. Our goal is to fully incorporate the black hole's spin and all the general relativistic effects on the observed spectra coming from X-ray binary systems while maintaining the simplicity of the standard disk model. That is possible by appropriately shifting only the disk's inner radius. We employ some of the most efficient pseudo-Newtonian potentials around Kerr black holes and derive two generalized disk temperature profiles, thus incorporating the spin's contribution to the thermal spectra. Then, we associate the observed radiative efficiency with the emission pattern featuring all the relativistic effects included in the kerrbb model, obtaining an expression about the modified inner radius of the disk. Moreover, we apply this method to Cygnus X-1 by fitting the observational data obtained during its high/soft and hard/low spectral states. The fully relativistic spectra are reproduced to a very good approximation with an error margin of 0.03-4%. The disk is parameterized by a modified innermost radius within the range of $(0.2-2)R_{ISCO}$, depending on the source's viewing angle and black hole spin. Relativistic effects near the black hole make an otherwise standard accretion disk with inclination $\theta <60^{\circ}$ seem truncated to larger radii to a distant observer. On the other hand, an edge-on view of the disk gives the perspective of being pulled closer to the central object than the respective ISCO radius. In addition, we show that the observational data of Cygnus X-1 can be satisfactorily fitted by employing a reasonably simple lepto-hadronic jet model and a hybrid thermal/non-thermal corona along with the Kerr-adjusted standard accretion disk.

 Fluorescence telescopes are important instruments widely used in modern experiments for registering ultraviolet radiation from extensive air showers (EASs) generated by cosmic rays of ultra-high energies. We present a proof-of-concept convolutional neural network aimed at reconstruction of energy and arrival directions of primary particles using model data for two telescopes developed by the international JEM-EUSO collaboration. We also demonstrate how a simple convolutional encoder-decoder can be used for EAS track recognition. The approach is generic and can be adopted for other fluorescence telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular clouds are the most important incubators of young stars clustered in various stellar structures whose spatial extension can vary from a few AU to several thousand AU. Although the reality of these stellar systems has been established, the physical origin of their multiplicity remains an open question. Our aim was to characterise these stellar groups at the onset of their formation by quantifying both the number of stars they contain and their mass using a hierarchical fragmentation model of the natal molecular cloud. We developed a stochastic and predictive model that reconciles the continuous multi-scale structure of a fragmenting molecular cloud with the discrete nature of the stars that are the products of this fragmentation. This model was implemented within a gravo-turbulent fragmentation framework to analytically follow the fragmentation properties along spatial scales using an isothermal and adiabatic equations of state (EOSs). Using an adiabatic EOS we determined a characteristic spatial scale where further fragmentation is prevented, around a few tens of AU. We show that fragmentation is a self-regulated process as fragments tend to become marginally unstable following a $M \propto R$ Bonnor-Ebert-like mass-size profile. Supersonic turbulent fragmentation structures the cloud down to $R \approx 0.1$ pc, and gradually turns into a less productive Jeans-type fragmentation under subsonic conditions so hierarchical fragmentation is a scale dependant process. Our work suggests that pre-stellar objects resulting from gas fragmentation, have to progressively increase their accretion rate in order to form stars. A hierarchical fragmentation scenario is compatible with both the multiplicity of stellar systems identified in Taurus and the multi-scale structure extracted within NGC 2264 molecular cloud.

 Recent outcomes by the DESI Collaboration have shed light on a possible slightly evolving dark energy, challenging the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. To better understand dark energy nature, high-redshift observations like gamma-ray burst data become essential for mapping the universe expansion history, provided they are calibrated with other probes. To this aim, we calibrate the $E_p-E_{iso}$ (or Amati) correlation through model-independent Bézier interpolations of the updated Hubble rate and the novel DESI data sets. More precisely, we provide two Bézier calibrations: i) handling the entire DESI sample, and ii) excluding the point at $z_{eff}=0.51$, criticized by the recent literature. In both the two options, we let the comoving sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$, vary in the range $r_d \in [138, 156]$ Mpc. The Planck value is also explored for comparison. By means of the so-calibrated gamma-ray bursts, we thus constrain three dark energy frameworks, namely the standard $\Lambda$CDM, the $\omega_0$CDM and the $\omega_0\omega_1$CDM models, in both spatially flat and non-flat universes. To do so, we worked out Monte Carlo Markov chain analyses, making use of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Further, we adopt model selection criteria to check the statistically preferred cosmological model finding a preference towards the concordance paradigm only whether the spatial curvature is zero. Conversely, and quite interestingly, the flat $\omega_0$CDM and both the cases, flat/non-flat, $\omega_0\omega_1$CDM model, leave evidently open the chance that dark energy evolves at higher redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 The theory of inflation provides a mechanism to explain the structures we observe today in the Universe, starting from quantum-mechanically generated fluctuations. However, this leaves the question of: how did the quantum-to-classical transition, occur? During inflation, tensor perturbations interact (at least gravitationally) with other fields, meaning that we need to view these perturbations as an open system that interacts with an environment. In this paper, the evolution of the system is described using a Lindblad equation, which describes the quantum decoherence of the system. This is a possible mechanism for explaining the quantum-to-classical transition. We show that this quantum decoherence leads to a scale-dependent increase of the gravitational wave power spectrum, depending on the strength and time dependence of the interaction between the system and the environment. By using current upper bounds on the gravitational wave power spectrum from inflation, obtained from CMB and the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA constraints, we find an upper bound on the interaction strength. Furthermore, we compute the decoherence criterion, which indicates the minimal interaction strength needed for a specific scale to have successfully decohered by the end of inflation. Assuming that the CMB modes have completely decohered, we indicate a lower bound on the interaction strength. In addition, this decoherence criterion allows us to look at which scales might not have fully decohered and could still show some relic quantum signatures. Lastly, we use sensitivity forecasts to study how future gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA and ET, could constrain the decoherence parameter space. Due to the scale-dependence of the power spectrum, LISA could only have a very small impact. However, ET will be able to significantly improve our current constraints for specific decoherence scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Signature from Pop III massive stars of $140$--$260\,{\rm M_\odot}$ that end their lives as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) are expected to be seen in very metal-poor (VMP) stars of ${\rm [Fe/H]}\leq -2$. Although thousands of VMP stars have been discovered, the identification of a VMP star with a PISN signature has been elusive. Recently, the VMP star LAMOST J1010+2358 was claimed to be the first star with a clear PISN signature. A subsequent study showed that ejecta from low-mass core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) can also fit the abundance pattern equally well and additional elements such as C and Al are required to differentiate the two sources. Follow-up observations of LAMOST J1010+2358 by two independent groups were able to detect both C and Al. Additionally, key odd elements such as Na and Sc were also detected whose abundances were found to be higher than the upper limits found in the original detection. We perform a detailed analysis of the newly observed abundance patterns by exploring various possible formation channels for VMP stars. We find that purely low-mass CCSN ejecta as well as the combination of CCSN and Type 1a SN ejecta can provide an excellent fit to the newly observed abundance pattern. Our results confirm earlier analysis that the newly observed abundance pattern is peculiar but has no signatures of PISN.

 - **Abstract**
 Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) observations of supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) candidate PKS~2131$-$021 revealed, for the first time, six likely characteristics of the phenomenology exhibited by SMBHB in blazars, of which the most unexpected and critical is sinusoidal flux density variations. We have now identified a second blazar, PKS~J0805$-$0111, showing significant sinusoidal variations, with an observed period that translates to $1.422 \pm 0.005$ yr in the rest frame of the $z = 1.388$ object. We generate $10^6$ simulated light curves to reproduce the radio variability characteristics of PKS~J0805$-$0111, and show that the global probability, considering the \textit{look-elsewhere effect}, indicates that the observed periodicity can be attributed to the red noise tail of the power spectral density, with a $p_0$ value of $7.8 \times 10^{-5}$ (i.e. 3.78$\sigma$). PKS J0805$-$0111 displays all six characteristics observed in PKS 2131$-$021. Taking into account the well-defined OVRO sample size, the false positive probability $\sim 0.22$, but the rare behavior makes this a strong SMBHB candidate. The discovery of a second SMBHB candidate exhibiting these rare characteristics reveals that PKS~2131$-$021 is not a unique, isolated case. With these two strong cases we are clearly seeing only the tip of the iceberg. We estimate that the number of SMBHB candidates amongst blazars $\sim$ 1 in 100.

          A Targeted Search for Variable Gravitationally Lensed Quasars

 - **Abstract**
 We present a pipeline to identify photometric variability within strong gravitationally lensing candidates, in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. In our first paper (Sheu et al. 2023), we laid out our pipeline and presented seven new gravitationally lensed supernovae candidates in a retrospective search. In this companion paper, we apply a modified version of that pipeline to search for gravitationally lensed quasars. From a sample of 5807 strong lenses, we have identified 13 new gravitationally lensed quasar candidates (three of them quadruply-lensed). We note that our methodology differs from most lensed quasar search algorithms that solely rely on the morphology, location, and color of the candidate systems. By also taking into account the temporal photometric variability of the posited lensed images in our search via difference imaging, we have discovered new lensed quasar candidates. While variability searches using difference imaging algorithms have been done in the past, they are typically preformed over vast swathes of sky, whereas we specifically target strong gravitationally lensed candidates. We also have applied our pipeline to 655 known gravitationally lensed quasar candidates from past lensed quasar searches, of which we identify 13 that display significant variability (one of them quadruply-lensed). This pipeline demonstrates a promising search strategy to discover gravitationally lensed quasars in other existing and upcoming surveys.
