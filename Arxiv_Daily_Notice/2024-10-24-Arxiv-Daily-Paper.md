          Origins of the fastest stars from merger-disruption of He-CO white dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 Hypervelocity white dwarfs (HVWDs) are stellar remnants moving at speeds exceeding the Milky Way's escape velocity. The origins of the fastest HVWDs are enigmatic, with proposed formation scenarios facing challenges explaining both their extreme velocities and observed properties. Here we report a three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of a merger between two hybrid helium-carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (HeCO WDs with masses of 0.68 and 0.62 M$_\odot$). We find that the merger leads to a partial disruption of the secondary WD, coupled with a double-detonation explosion of the primary WD. This launches the remnant core of the secondary WD at a speed of $~2000$ km s$^{-1}$, consistent with observed HVWDs. The low mass of the ejected remnant and its heating from the primary WD's ejecta explain the observed luminosities and temperatures of hot HVWDs, which are otherwise difficult to reconcile with previous models. This discovery establishes a new formation channel for HVWDs and points to a previously unrecognized pathway for producing peculiar Type Ia supernovae and faint explosive transients.

          Monitoring Observations of SMC X-1's Excursions (MOOSE) III: X-ray Spectroscopy of a Warped, Precessing Accretion Disc

 - **Abstract**
 The MOOSE (Monitoring Observations of SMC X-1 Excursions) program uses the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer Mission (NICER) to monitor the high mass X-ray binary SMC X-1 during its superorbital period excursions. Here we perform X-ray spectral analyses of 26 NICER observations of SMC X-1, taken at the tail-end of the excursion between 2021-04-01 and 2022-01-05. We use a single spectral model to fit spectra observed in high, intermediate and low states, using a combination of a partial covering fraction model, a black-body disc, and a power-law component. We find that the partial covering fraction varies significantly with the superorbital state during superorbital excursion. Our findings suggest that the low/high state in SMC X-1 is caused by a very high obscuration of the accretion disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical integration methods are central to the study of self-gravitating systems, particularly those comprised of many bodies or otherwise beyond the reach of analytical methods. Predictor-corrector schemes, both multi-step methods and those based on 2-point Hermite interpolation, have found great success in the simulation of star clusters and other collisional systems. Higher-order methods, such as those based on Gaussian quadratures and Richardson extrapolation, have also proven popular for high-accuracy integrations of few-body systems, particularly those that may undergo close encounters. This work presents a family of high-order schemes based on multi-point Hermite interpolation. When applied as a multi-step multi-derivative schemes, these can be seen as generalizing both Adams-Bashforth-Moulton methods and 2-point Hermite methods; I present results for the 6th-, 9th-, and 12th-order 3-point schemes applied in this manner using variable time steps. In a cluster-like test problem, the 3-point 6th-order predictor-corrector scheme matches or outperforms the standard 2-point 4th-order Hermite scheme at negligible O(N) cost. I also present a number of high-order time-symmetric schemes up to 18th order, which have the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of long-duration simulations.

          Development of convective envelopes in massive stars: Implications for gravitational wave sources

 - **Abstract**
 The structure of stellar envelopes strongly influences the course and outcome of binary mass transfer, in particular of common envelope (CE) evolution. Convective envelopes can most easily be ejected during CE events, leading to short-period binaries and potentially gravitational wave (GW) sources. Conversely, radiative envelope are thought to lead to CE mergers and Thorne-Zytkow objects (TZOs) or quasi-stars (QS). Rapid binary models based on Hurley et al. (2000) often assume that any CE event with a Hertzsprung gap donor results in a CE merger, in tension with literature. We improve this with a more self-consistent criterion based on the presence of a convective envelope. Using 1D stellar models (MESA), we systematically investigate the development of convective envelopes in massive stars. We provide fitting formulae for rapid binary codes and implement them into the StarTrack population synthesis code to refine the CE treatment and examine the impact on GW sources, TZOs, and QSs. We show that convective envelopes in massive stars are highly sensitive to the treatment of superadiabacity and the mixing length. Our revised CE model significantly reduces (factor 20) the predicted merger rate of binary black hole (BH-BH) mergers with total masses between roughly 20 and 50 Msun. This leads to a bimodal mass distribution with a strong metallicity dependence. We also predict that the current TZO/QS formation rate in the Galaxy (up to roughly 10-4 yr-1), combined with their predicted lifetimes, makes their detection unlikely. Our study strongly suggests that the role of CE evolution in the formation of BH-BH mergers has been considerably overestimated for BH-BH mergers with Mtot > 20 Msun. We highlight that any prediction from the CE channel for massive BH-BH mergers (>50 Msun) heavily hinges on our limited understanding of stellar structure and mass loss close to the Eddington limit.

          Probing Conditions for Strong Clumping by the Streaming Instability: Small Dust Grains and Low Dust-to-gas Density Ratio

 - **Abstract**
 The streaming instability (SI) is a leading mechanism for concentrating solid particles into regions dense enough to form planetesimals. Its efficiency in clumping particles depends primarily on the dimensionless stopping time ($\tau_s$, a proxy for particle size) and dust-to-gas surface density ratio ($Z$). Previous simulations identified a critical $Z$ ($Z_{\rm{crit}}$) above which strong clumping occurs, where particle densities exceed the Hill density (thus satisfying a condition for gravitational collapse), over a wide range of $\tau_s$. These works found that for $\tau_s \leq 0.01$, $Z_{\rm{crit}}$ was above the ISM value $(\sim 0.01)$. In this work, we reexamine the clumping threshold using 2D axisymmetric, stratified simulations at high resolution and with relatively large (compared to many previous simulations) domain sizes. Our main results are as follows: First, when $\tau_s = 0.01$, strong clumping occurs even at $Z \lesssim 0.01$, lower than $Z_{\rm{crit}}$ found in all previous studies. Consequently, we revise a previously published fit to the $Z_{\rm{crit}}$ curve to account for this updated $Z_{\rm{crit}}$. Second, higher resolution results in a thicker dust layer, which may result from other instabilities manifesting, such as the vertical shearing streaming instability. Third, despite this thicker layer, higher resolution can lead to strong clumping even with lower midplane dust-to-gas density ratios (which results from the thicker particle layer) so long as $Z \gtrsim Z_{\rm{crit}}$. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of the SI in clumping small particles at $Z \sim 0.01$, which is a significant refinement of the conditions for planetesimal formation by the SI.

          3-D CMZ III: Constraining the 3-D structure of the Central Molecular Zone via molecular line emission and absorption

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is the largest concentration of dense molecular gas in the Galaxy, the structure of which is shaped by the complex interplay between Galactic-scale dynamics and extreme physical conditions. Understanding the 3-D geometry of this gas is crucial as it determines the locations of star formation and subsequent feedback. We present a catalogue of clouds in the CMZ using Herschel data. Using archival data from the APEX and MOPRA CMZ surveys, we measure averaged kinematic properties of the clouds at 1mm and 3mm. We use archival ATCA data of the H$_{2}$CO (1$_{1,0}$ - 1$_{1,1}$) 4.8 GHz line to search for absorption towards the clouds, and 4.85 GHz GBT C-band data to measure the radio continuum emission. We measure the absorption against the continuum to provide new constraints for the line-of-sight positions of the clouds relative to the Galactic centre, and find a highly asymmetric distribution, with most clouds residing in front of the Galactic centre. The results are compared with different orbital models, and we introduce a revised toy model of a vertically-oscillating closed elliptical orbit. We find that most models describe the PPV structure of the gas reasonably well, but find significant inconsistencies in all cases regarding the near vs. far placement of individual clouds. Our results highlight that the CMZ is likely more complex than can be captured by these simple geometric models, along with the need for new data to provide further constraints on the true 3-D structure of the CMZ.

          Properties of black hole-star binaries formed in $N$-body simulations of massive star clusters: implications for Gaia black holes

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate black hole-star binaries formed in $N$-body simulations of massive, dense star clusters. We simulate 32 clusters with varying initial masses ($10^{4}~\rm M_{\odot}$ to $10^{6}~\rm M_{\odot}$), densities ($1200~\rm M_{\odot}~pc^{-3}$ to $10^{5}~\rm M_{\odot}~pc^{-3}$), and metallicities $(Z = 0.01,~0.001,~0.0001)$. Our results reveal that star clusters produce a diverse range of BH-star binaries, with dynamical interactions leading to extreme systems characterised by large orbital separations and high black hole masses. Of the ejected BH-main sequence (BH-MS) binaries, $20\%$ form dynamically, while the rest originate from the primordial binary population initially present in the cluster. Ejected BH-MS binaries that are dynamically formed have more massive black holes, lower-mass stellar companions, and over half are in a hierarchical triple system. All unbound BH-giant star (BH-GS) binaries were ejected as BH-MS binaries and evolved into the BH-GS phase outside the cluster. Due to their lower-mass companions, most dynamically formed binaries do not evolve into BH-GS systems within a Hubble time. Consequently, only 2 of the 35 ejected BH-GS binaries are dynamically formed. We explore the formation pathways of Gaia-like systems, identifying two Gaia BH1-like binaries that formed through dynamical interactions, and two Gaia BH2-like systems with a primordial origin. We did not find any system resembling Gaia BH3, which may however be attributed to the limited sample size of our simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 In the previous paper of this series, we proposed a new function to fit halo density profiles out to large radii. This truncated Einasto profile models the inner, orbiting matter as $\rho_{\rm orb} \propto \exp \left[-2/\alpha\ (r / r_{\rm s})^\alpha - 1/\beta\ (r / r_{\rm t})^\beta \right]$ and the outer, infalling term as a power-law overdensity. In this paper, we analyse the resulting parameter space of scale radius $r_{\rm s}$, truncation radius $r_{\rm t}$, steepening $\alpha$, truncation sharpness $\beta$, infalling normalisation $\delta_1$, and infalling slope $s$. We show that these parameters are non-degenerate in averaged profiles, and that fits to the total profiles generally recover the underlying properties of the orbiting and infalling terms. We study the connection between profile parameters and halo properties such as mass (or peak height) and accretion rate. We find that the commonly cited dependence of $\alpha$ on peak height is an artefact of fitting Einasto profiles to the actual, truncated profiles. In our fits, $\alpha$ is independent of mass but dependent on accretion rate. When fitting individual halo profiles, the parameters exhibit significant scatter but otherwise follow the same trends. We confirm that the entire profiles are sensitive to the accretion history of haloes, and that the two radial scales $r_{\rm s}$ and $r_{\rm t}$ particularly respond to the formation time and recent accretion rate. As a result, $r_{\rm t}$ is a more accurate measure of the accretion rate than the commonly used radius where the density slope is steepest.

 - **Abstract**
 The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is the largest reservoir of dense molecular gas in the Galaxy and is heavily obscured in the optical and near-IR. We present an overview of the far-IR dust continuum, where the molecular clouds are revealed, provided by Herschel in the inner 40°($|l| <$ 20°) of the Milky Way with a particular focus on the CMZ. We report a total dense gas ($N$(H$_2$) $> 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) CMZ mass of M=$2\substack{+2 \\ -1} \times 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ and confirm that there is a highly asymmetric distribution of dense gas, with about 70-75% at positive longitudes. We create and publicly release complete fore/background-subtracted column density and dust temperature maps in the inner 40°($|l| <$ 20°) of the Galaxy. We find that the CMZ clearly stands out as a distinct structure, with an average mass per longitude that is at least $3\times$ higher than the rest of the inner Galaxy contiguously from 1.8°$> \ell >$ -1.3°. This CMZ extent is larger than previously assumed, but is consistent with constraints from velocity information. The inner Galaxy's column density peaks towards the SgrB2 complex with a value of about 2 $\times$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, and typical CMZ molecular clouds are about N(H$_2$)=10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. Typical CMZ dust temperatures range from about $12-35$ K with relatively little variation. We identify a ridge of warm dust in the inner CMZ that potentially traces the base of the northern Galactic outflow seen with MEERKAT.

 - **Abstract**
 The flat spectrum radio quasar PKS 1510-089 is one of the most active blazars in $\gamma$-rays, exhibiting phases of very high activity. This study investigates its variability over a decade across a wide range of wavelengths, from radio to $\gamma$-rays. Utilizing the non-thermal dominance parameter, we analyze the H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, and $\lambda5100\text{ Å}$ continuum light curves to discern the primary source of continuum emission, either from the accretion disk or the jet, during different activity phases. Our findings underscore the dominance of jet emission in the continuum during flare-like events. We observed an approximately 80-day delay between the H$\beta$ and continuum emissions, which we attribute to the spatial separation between the optical emission zone and the broad-line region. Near-zero delays between optical and near-infrared emissions suggest that the emitting regions within the jet are co-spatial. Synchrotron self-Compton was identified as the primary mechanism for $\gamma$-ray emission during flares, supported by the minimal delay observed between optical/near-infrared emissions and $\gamma$-rays. Additionally, we found a delay of about 60 days between the leading optical/near-infrared emissions and X-rays, indicating that inverse Compton scattering within the jet predominantly drives X-ray emission. However, distinguishing between synchrotron self-Compton and external inverse Compton mechanism was not feasible. Shifts in the spectral index across the 15-230 GHz range corresponded with ejections from the radio core, suggesting changes in the physical conditions of the jet.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultraviolet wavelengths offer unique insights into aerosols in exoplanetary atmospheres. However, only a handful of exoplanets have been observed in the ultraviolet to date. Here, we present the ultraviolet-visible transmission spectrum of the inflated hot Jupiter WASP-127b. We observed one transit of WASP-127b with WFC3/UVIS G280 as part of the Hubble Ultraviolet-optical Survey of Transiting Legacy Exoplanets (HUSTLE), obtaining a transmission spectrum from 200-800 nm. Our reductions yielded a broad-band transit depth precision of 91 ppm and a median precision of 240 ppm across 59 spectral channels. Our observations are suggestive of a high-altitude cloud layer with forward modeling showing they are composed of sub-micron particles and retrievals indicating a high opacity patchy cloud. While our UVIS/G280 data only offers weak evidence for Na, adding archival HST WFC3/IR and STIS observations raises the overall Na detection significance to 4.1-sigma. Our work demonstrates the capabilities of HST WFC3/UVIS G280 observations to probe the aerosols and atmospheric composition of transiting hot Jupiters with comparable precision to HST STIS.

          ATOMS: ALMA three-millimeter observations of massive star-forming regions -- XVIII. On the origin and evolution of dense gas fragments in molecular shells of compact HII regions

 - **Abstract**
 Fragmentation and evolution for the molecular shells of the compact HII regions are less explored compared to their evolved counterparts. We map nine compact HII regions with a typical diameter of 0.4 pc that are surrounded by molecular shells traced by CCH. Several to a dozen dense gas fragments probed by H13CO+ are embedded in these molecular shells. These gas fragments, strongly affected by the HII region, have a higher surface density, mass, and turbulence than those outside the shells but within the same pc-scale natal clump. These features suggest that the shells swept up by the early HII regions can enhance the formation of massive dense structures that may host the birth of higher-mass stars. We examine the formation of fragments and find that fragmentation of the swept-up shell is unlikely to occur in these early HII regions, by comparing the expected time scale of shell fragmentation with the age of HII region. We propose that the appearance of gas fragments in these shells is probably the result of sweeping up pre-existing fragments into the molecular shell that has not yet fragmented. Taken together, this work provides a basis for understanding the interplay of star-forming sites with an intricate environment containing ionization feedback such as those observed in starburst regions.

 - **Abstract**
 An important task in the study of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains the automatic classification of repeating and non-repeating sources based on their morphological properties. We propose a statistical model that considers a modified logistic regression to classify FRB sources. The classical logistic regression model is modified to accommodate the small proportion of repeaters in the data, a feature that is likely due to the sampling procedure and duration and is not a characteristic of the population of FRB sources. The weighted logistic regression hinges on the choice of a tuning parameter that represents the true proportion $\tau$ of repeating FRB sources in the entire population. The proposed method has a sound statistical foundation, direct interpretability, and operates with only 5 parameters, enabling quicker retraining with added data. Using the CHIME/FRB Collaboration sample of repeating and non-repeating FRBs and numerical experiments, we achieve a classification accuracy for repeaters of nearly 75\% or higher when $\tau$ is set in the range of $50$ to $60$\%. This implies a tentative high proportion of repeaters, which is surprising, but is also in agreement with recent estimates of $\tau$ that are obtained using other methods.

 - **Abstract**
 The ice giant planets Uranus and Neptune are assumed to contain large amounts of planetary ices such as water, methane, and ammonia. The properties of mixtures of such ices at the extreme pressures and temperatures of planetary interiors are not yet well understood. Ab initio computer simulations predicted that a number of ices exhibit a hydrogen superionic state and a doubly superionic state [DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-42958-0]. Since the latter state has not yet been generated with experiments, we outline here two possible pathways for reaching and detecting such a state with dynamic compression experiments. We suggest X-ray diffraction as the principal tool for detecting when the material becomes doubly superionic and the sublattice of one of the heavy nuclei melts. That would require a temperature of $\sim$3500 K and pressures greater than $\sim$200 GPa for H$_3$NO$_4$, which we use as an example material here. Such conditions can be reached with experiments that employ an initial shock that is followed by a ramp compression wave. Alternatively, one may use triple-shock compression because a single shock does not yield sufficiently high densities.

 - **Abstract**
 The measurement of continuum time lags in lensed quasars can effectively probe the accretion physics of quasars. This is because microlensing observations of lensed quasars can provide constraints on the half-light radii of quasar accretion disks. By combining the microlensing results with time lag measurements, one can, for the first time, estimate the propagation velocity of the physical process that drives inter-band time lags and cross-correlations among disk emission (i.e. in UV/optical bands). In this study, we perform the disk reverberation mapping study for the well-studied lensed quasar, Q0957+561. The cross-correlation between the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) $g$ and $r$ bands was measured; the $g$ variations lead the $r$ ones by $6.4\pm 2.6$ days in the rest frame. In combination with the half-light radius from the existing literature, we find that the propagation velocity of the variability mechanism should be $1.7^{+1.5}_{-0.7}$ times the speed of light. We discuss the possible outcomes of this result. Similar studies can be applied to other lensed quasars by utilizing the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) observations.

 I explore observational effects of the cirsumstellar gas around superluminous supernova SN~2018ibb. High velocity Fe II narrow absorptions are reproduced in the model of fragmented cold dense shell. Unusual selective absorption in the emission doublet of [O I] is explained as an effect of the radiation scattering in Si II doublet lines in the supernova this http URL strong emission of [O III] doublet at t_max + 565 days is proposed to originate from the supernova envelope, whereas its asymmetry is explained by the dust formation in the unshocked ejecta. Circumstellar interaction modeling combined with observational data suggests the cirsumstellar shell mass of about 0.14 Msun.

 - **Abstract**
 We present HIP 8522, a young solar twin with the lowest detected lithium, potentially a field blue straggler or the result of episodic early accretion. Its stellar parameters ($T_{\rm eff} = 5729 \pm 7$ K, $\log g = 4.532 \pm 0.016$ dex, $\rm{[Fe/H]} = 0.005 \pm 0.010$ dex, $v_{t} = 1.08 \pm 0.02$ km s$^{-1}$) and chemical composition were determined via spectroscopic equilibrium using high resolution spectra ($R = 60~000-165~000$). The age of HIP 8522 was estimated to be an upper limit of $<$1 Gyr through isochrone fitting and was further confirmed using chemical clocks. Spectral synthesis of the lithium line at $\sim$6707.8 Å yielded an upper lithium abundance limit of $A(\rm{Li}) <$ 0.8 dex. This value is unusually low for solar twins of similar age, which typically have $A(\rm{Li})$ values ranging from 2.0 to 3.3 dex, suggesting that $\sim$2 dex of lithium is missing. We investigate various scenarios, such as planet engulfment, sub-stellar mergers, and extra mixing. However, two distinct hypotheses provide plausible explanations for the significant depletion of lithium: one suggests that HIP 8522 is a field blue straggler formed by the merger of a close binary, while the other proposes that HIP 8522 experienced early episodic accretion. The young solar twin HIP 8522 presents an exceptional opportunity to rigorously test stellar evolution models and gain crucial insights into the internal mixing mechanisms responsible for the significant destruction of lithium.

 - **Abstract**
 In this communication, we report on the results of the second phase of the Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge started in 2019. This second phase focuses on the characterization of point sources (exoplanet signals) within multispectral high-contrast images from ground-based telescopes. We collected eight data sets from two high-contrast integral field spectrographs (namely Gemini-S/GPI and VLT/SPHERE-IFS) that we calibrated homogeneously, and in which we injected a handful of synthetic planetary signals (ground truth) to be characterized by the data challenge participants. The tasks of the participants consist of (1) extracting the precise astrometry of each injected planetary signals, and (2) extracting the precise spectro-photometry of each injected planetary signal. Additionally, the participants may provide the 1-sigma uncertainties on their estimation for further analyses. When available, the participants can also provide the posterior distribution used to estimate the position/spectrum and uncertainties. The data are permanently available on a Zenodo repository and the participants can submit their results through the EvalAI platform. The EvalAI submission platform opened on April 2022 and closed on the 31st of May 2024. In total, we received 4 valid submissions for the astrometry estimation and 4 valid submissions for the spectrophotometry (each submission, corresponding to one pipeline, has been submitted by a unique participant). In this communication, we present an analysis and interpretation of the results.

          Studying the X-ray absorption characteristics of Centaurus X-3 using nearly 14 years of MAXI/GSC data

 - **Abstract**
 Centaurus X-3 is a persistent high-mass X-ray binary with the long-term light curve from the source exhibiting orbit-to-orbit intensity variations with no apparent superorbital periodicity. We used $\sim$13.5 years of MAXI/GSC data to study the long-term behaviour of X-ray absorption caused by the stellar wind from the companion star and any absorbing structures present in the binary. We used orbital-phase-resolved spectroscopy to study the variation in the photoelectric absorption along the line of sight of the source for both the intensity-averaged data and intensity-resolved data after dividing all the data binned with orbital period into three intensity levels. We find an asymmetric variation in the photoelectric absorption along the line of sight across an orbit of the source. The orbital-phase-resolved spectra show a clear increase in photoelectric absorption after $\phi_\text{orb}\sim$ 0.5, which deviates from a spherically symmetric stellar wind model. The flux of Cen X-3 shows significant variation between consecutive orbits. An intensity-resolved spectral analysis of the source was performed, followed by an intensity-resolved and orbital-phase-resolved spectral analysis, which showed that at the medium and high intensity levels, the orbital-phase-resolved photoelectric absorption is slightly asymmetric with respect to mid-phase ($\phi_\text{orb}=$ 0.5). The asymmetry is very pronounced at the lowest intensity level and cannot be explained by a spherically symmetric wind from the companion star. The differences in the orbital phase-dependence of absorption for different intensity levels suggest that the presence of an accretion wake, photoionization wake, or tidal stream is more prominent at a lower intensity level for Centaurus X-3 than at a higher intensity level.

 In this work we introduce ProGeny, a new stellar population library (SPL) software package written in R. This release encapsulates the core software to generate simple/single stellar populations (SSPs); the various data inputs required (in particular isochrones and stellar atmospheres); example scripts to generate the SSPs; and a number of pre-generated static SSP available forimmediate this http URL mostnovelfeature ofProGeny is itsabilitytoproduce SSPs with evolving initial mass functions, allowing functional dependencies on stellar age or metallicity. We perform both internal comparisons (within the ProGeny SPL) and external comparisons (with other public SSPs) and tests. The main conclusion is that the choice of isochrone has significantly more impact on the predicted spectra than the choice of stellar atmospheres and/or IMF (comparing Chabrier and Kroupa variants).

          Constraining the CSM structure and progenitor mass-loss history of interacting supernovae through 3D hydrodynamic modeling: The case of SN 2014C

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate SN 2014C using three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling, focusing on its early interaction with dense circumstellar medium (CSM). Our objective is to uncover the pre-supernova (SN) CSM structure and constrain the progenitor star's mass-loss history prior to core collapse. Our comprehensive model traces the evolution from the progenitor star through the SN event and into the SN remnant (SNR) phase. We simulate the remnant's expansion over approximately 15 years, incorporating a CSM derived from the progenitor star's outflows through dedicated hydrodynamic simulations. Analysis reveals that the remnant interacted with a dense toroidal nebula extending from $4.3\times 10^{16}\,$cm to $1.5\times 10^{17}$ cm in the equatorial plane, with a thickness of approximately $1.2\times 10^{17}$ cm. The nebula's density peaks at approximately $3\times 10^6\,$cm$^{-3}$ at the inner boundary, gradually decreasing as $\approx r^{-2}$ at greater distances. This nebula formed due to intense mass-loss from the progenitor star between approximately 5000 and 1000 years before collapse. During this period, the maximum mass-loss rate reached about $8\times 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}\,$yr$^{-1}$, ejecting $\approx 2.5\,M_{\odot}$ of stellar material into the CSM. Our model accurately reproduces Chandra and NuSTAR spectra, including the Fe K line, throughout the remnant's evolution. Notably, the Fe line is self-consistently reproduced, originating from shocked ejecta, with $\approx 0.05\,M_{\odot}$ of pure-Fe ejecta shocked during the remnant-nebula interaction. These findings suggest that the 3D geometry and density distribution of the CSM, as well as the progenitor star's mass-loss history, align with a scenario where the star was stripped through binary interaction, specifically common envelope evolution.

          Anisotropies of cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds in non-flat spacetime

 - **Abstract**
 Recent reports of stochastic gravitational wave background from four independent pulsar-timing-array collaborations have renewed the interest in the cosmological gravitational wave background (CGWB), which is expected to open a new window into the early Universe. Although the early Universe is supposed to be flat from an inflationary point of view, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data alone from the Planck satellite measurement prefers an enhanced lensing amplitude that can be explained by a closed Universe. In this paper, we propose an independent method to constrain the early-Universe flatness from the anisotropies of CGWB. Using the generalized harmonic decompositions in the non-flat spacetime, we find CGWBs from different physical mechanisms such as cosmic inflation and phase transitions share the same integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) term but possess different SW terms, which would exhibit different behaviors when including the spatial curvature since the ISW effect is more sensitive to the spatial curvature than the SW effect. Furthermore, we provide the cross-correlations between CGWB and CMB, implying a positive or negative correlation between their SW effect terms depending on the GW mechanisms, which may hint at the sign of f NL when considering non-Gaussianity contributions to anisotropies.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-mass emission-line stars belong to various evolutionary stages, from pre-main-sequence young stars to evolved stars. In this work, we present a catalog of late-type (F0 to M9) emission-line stars from the LAMOST Data Release 6. Using the scipy package, we created a Python code that finds the emission peak at H-alpha in all late-type stellar spectra. A dataset of 38,152 late-type emission-line stars was obtained after a rigorous examination of the photometric quality flags and the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra. Adopting well-known photometric and spectroscopic methods, we classified our sample into 438 infrared excess sources, 4,669 post-main-sequence candidates, 9,718 Fe/Ge/Ke sources, and 23,264 dMe sources. From a cross-match with known databases, we found that 29,222 sources, comprising 65 IR excess sources, 7,899 Fe/Ge/Ke stars, 17,533 dMe stars, and 3,725 PtMS candidates, are new detections. We measured the equivalent width of the major emission lines observed in the spectra of our sample of emission-line stars. Furthermore, the trend observed in the line strengths of major emission lines over the entire late-type spectral range is analyzed. We further classified the sample into 4 groups based on the presence of Hydrogen and Calcium emission lines. This work presents a large dataset of late-type emission-line stars, which can be used to study active phenomena in late-type stars.

 - **Abstract**
 ALICE is a large experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Located 52 meters underground, its detectors are suitable to measure muons produced by cosmic-ray interactions in the atmosphere. In this paper, the studies of the cosmic muons registered by ALICE during Run 2 (2015--2018) are described. The analysis is limited to multimuon events defined as events with more than four detected muons ($N_\mu>4$) and in the zenith angle range $0^{\circ}<\theta<50^{\circ}$. The results are compared with Monte Carlo simulations using three of the main hadronic interaction models describing the air shower development in the atmosphere: QGSJET-II-04, EPOS-LHC, and SIBYLL 2.3. The interval of the primary cosmic-ray energy involved in the measured muon multiplicity distribution is about $ 4 \times 10^{15}<E_\mathrm{prim}< 6 \times 10^{16}$~eV. In this interval none of the three models is able to describe precisely the trend of the composition of cosmic rays as the energy increases. However, QGSJET is found to be the only model capable of reproducing reasonably well the muon multiplicity distribution, assuming a heavy composition of the primary cosmic rays over the whole energy range, while SIBYLL and EPOS-LHC underpredict the number of muons in a large interval of multiplicity by more than $20\%$ and $30\%$, respectively. The rate of high muon multiplicity events ($N_\mu>100$) obtained with QGSJET and SIBYLL is compatible with the data, while EPOS-LHC produces a significantly lower rate ($55\%$ of the measured rate). For both QGSJET and SIBYLL, the rate is close to the data when the composition is assumed to be dominated by heavy elements, an outcome compatible with the average energy $E_\mathrm{prim} \sim 10^{17}$~eV of these events. This result places significant constraints on more exotic production mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 II Zw 40 is a starburst dwarf and merger product, and holds a radio-infrared supernebula excited by thousands of embedded OB stars. We present here observations of three aspects of the supernebula: maps of the K and KU radio continuum that trace dense ionized gas with spatial resolution $\sim0.1^{\prime\prime}$, a spectral data cube of the [S IV]$10.5\mu$m emission line that measures the kinematics of the ionized gas with velocity resolution $4.5$ km s$^{-1}$, and an ALMA spectral cube of the CO(3-2) line that probes the dense warm molecular gas with spatial and velocity resolution comparable to the ionized gas. The observations suggest that the supernebula is the overlap,collision or merger of two star clusters, each associated with an elongated molecular cloud. We accordingly modelled the supernebula with simulations of colliding clusters. The model that best agrees with the data is a grazing collision that has distorted the gas and stars to create the distinctive structures observed. These models may have wide applicability in the cluster-rich regions of young starbursts.

 - **Abstract**
 The Arches cluster, one of the most massive clusters in the Milky Way, is located about 30 pc in projection from the central massive black hole. With its high mass, young age, and location in the Galaxy's most extreme star forming environment, the Arches is an extraordinary laboratory to study massive stars and clusters. Our objective is to improve our knowledge of the properties of massive stars and the Arches cluster through high angular resolution radio continuum studies. We observed the Arches cluster with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in the C- and X-bands throughout 2016, 2018, and 2022. We used the A-configuration to achieve the highest possible angular resolution and cross-matched the detected point sources with stars detected in the infrared, using proper motion catalogues to ensure cluster membership. We report the most extensive radio point source catalogue of the cluster to date, with a total of 25 radio detections. We also created the deepest radio images of the cluster so far. Most of our stellar radio sources (12/18) show a positive spectral index, indicating that the dominant emission process is free-free thermal radiation, which probably originates from stellar winds. We found that radio variability is more frequent than what was inferred from previous observations, affecting up to 60% of the sources associated with bright stellar counterparts. We propose four of our detections (F6, F18, F19 and F26) as primary candidates for colliding-wind binaries based on their consistent flat-to-negative spectral index. We classify F7, F9, F12, F14, and F55 as secondary colliding wind binary candidates based on their high flux and/or spectral index variability, and X-ray counterparts. Thus, we infer a 61% multiplicity fraction for the Arches cluster radio-stars when combining our findings with recent infrared radial velocity studies.

 A solar active region can significantly disrupt the Sun Earth space environment, often leading to severe space weather events such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections. As a consequence, the automatic classification of active region groups is the crucial starting point for accurately and promptly predicting solar activity. This study presents our results concerned with the application of deep learning techniques to the classification of active region cutouts based on the Mount Wilson classification scheme. Specifically, we have explored the latest advancements in image classification architectures, from Convolutional Neural Networks to Vision Transformers, and reported on their performances for the active region classification task, showing that the crucial point for their effectiveness consists in a robust training process based on the latest advances in the field.

 - **Abstract**
 If primordial scalar or tensor perturbations are enhanced on short scales, it may lead to the production of observable gravitational wave signals. These waves may be sourced by scalar-scalar, scalar-tensor or tensor-tensor interactions. Typically, models of inflation capable of producing large peaks in the scalar primordial power spectrum also generate sizeable scalar non-Gaussianity. Previous studies have investigated the possible effects of this on the scalar-scalar induced gravitational wave spectrum by assuming a local expansion in terms of the parameters $F_{\textrm{NL}}$, $G_{\textrm{NL}}$ and so on. We extend this approach to the case of scalar-tensor induced gravitational waves, introducing a local expansion for scalar non-Gaussianity into the scalar-tensor sector equations. We compute the contribution to the gravitational wave spectrum from the resulting new term and analyse its distinguishing features.

 The Chasing All Transients Constellation Hunters (CATCH) space mission is focused on exploring the dynamic universe via X-ray follow-up observations of various transients. The first pathfinder of the CATCH mission, CATCH-1, was launched on June 22, 2024, alongside the Space-based multiband astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) mission. CATCH-1 is equipped with narrow-field optimized Micro Pore Optics (MPOs) featuring a large effective area and incorporates four Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs) in its focal plane. This paper presents the system calibration results conducted before the satellite integration. Utilizing the data on the performance of the mirror and detectors obtained through the system calibration, combined with simulated data, the ground calibration database can be established. Measuring the relative positions of the mirror and detector system, which were adjusted during system calibration, allows for accurate installation of the entire satellite. Furthermore, the paper outlines the operational workflow of the ground network post-satellite launch.

          Radio sensitivity to a new population of millisecond pulsars in the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 Observations with the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope reveal an excess of extended gamma-ray emission likely caused by an undiscovered population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the core of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph). However, additional evidence, such as multi-wavelength searches, is necessary to confirm this theory. A significant discovery could be made if radio pulsations from individual MSPs in the Sgr dSph are detected. In this study, we investigate the possibility of detecting MSPs in the Sgr dSph with present and upcoming radio surveys using a phenomenological model based on the observed luminosity function of MSPs in the Milky Way's globular clusters. Our findings suggest that the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) is the most sensitive instrument for detecting these objects. We demonstrate that to observe one MSP with MeerKAT, we would need to perform a pointing observation of the core region of the Sgr dSph for about two hours. In this same observation time, SKA can identify $9^{+5}_{-3}$ MSPs in the entire system. Based on the distance of the Sgr dSph galaxy and our dispersion measure distance estimate, we find it possible to differentiate between MSPs belonging to the Sgr dSph and those of the Galactic disk and bulge. Furthermore, the MSPs hypothesis for the Sgr dSph gamma-ray excess could be confirmed at the 99.7\% confidence level by detecting at least six MSPs in a two-hour SKA observation of the Sgr dSph.

 - **Abstract**
 The composition of rocky planets is strongly driven by the primordial materials in the protoplanetary disk, which can be inferred from the abundances of the host star. Understanding this compositional link is crucial for characterizing exoplanets. We aim to investigate the relationship between the compositions of low-mass planets and their host stars. We determined the primordial compositions of host stars using high-precision present-day stellar abundances and stellar evolutionary models. These primordial abundances were then input into a stoichiometric model to estimate the composition of planet-building blocks. Additionally, we employed a three-component planetary interior model (core, mantle, water in different phases) to estimate planetary compositions based only on their radius and mass. We found that although stellar abundances vary over time, relevant abundance ratios like Fe/Mg remain relatively constant during the main sequence evolution for low temperature stars. A strong correlation is found between the iron-to-silicate mass fraction of protoplanetary disks and planets, while no significant correlation was observed for water mass fractions. The Fe/Mg ratio varies significantly between planets and their stars, indicating substantial disk-driven compositional diversity, and this ratio also correlates with planetary radius. While stellar abundances, as a proxy of the composition of protoplanetary disk, provide a baseline for planetary composition, significant deviations arise due to complex disk processes, challenging the assumption of a direct, one-to-one elemental relationship between stars and their planets.

 By introducing the small noise expansion techniques, we show that the fully nonlinear (non-Markovian) stochastic inflationary system, may be re-cast in terms of an infinite set of Wiener processes (stochastic equations with white noises). As a byproduct, we show that the Starobinsky test field approximation might only provide information about the linear regime of cosmological perturbations and scalar-feld non-Gaussianities might only appear at next to leading order in slow-roll parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 LEIA (Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy) detected a new X-ray transient on November 7, 2022, identified as a superflare event occurring on a nearby RS CVn-type binary HD 251108. The flux increase was also detected in follow-up observations at X-ray, UV and optical wavelengths. The flare lasted for about 40 days in soft X-ray observations, reaching a peak luminosity of ~1.1 * 10^34 erg/s in 0.5-4.0 keV, which is roughly 60 times the quiescent luminosity. Optical brightening was observed for only one night. The X-ray light curve is well described by a double "FRED" (fast rise and exponential decay) model, attributed to the cooling process of a loop arcade structure formed subsequent to the initial large loop with a half-length of ~1.9 times the radius of the host star. Time-resolved X-ray spectra were fitted with a two-temperature apec model, showing significant evolution of plasma temperature, emission measure, and metal abundance over time. The estimated energy released in the LEIA band is ~3 * 10^39 erg, suggesting this is likely the most energetic X-ray stellar flare with the longest duration detected to date.

 - **Abstract**
 A crucial component of the high-contrast instrumental chain in astronomy is the wavefront sensor (WFS). A key property of this component is its sensitivities, which reflect its ability to efficiently use incoming photons to encode the phase aberrations. This paper introduces a new class of highly sensitive wavefront sensors that approach the fundamental sensitivity limits dictated by physics. Assuming a high Strehl regime, we define what linear operator is describing the ideal WFS that would achieve maximum sensitivity. We then show that there is a substantial similarity between this ideal WFS and the second-order ideal coronagraph. Leveraging the exhibited link between ideal wavefront sensing and coronagraphy, we propose a novel WFS concept based on high-performance coronagraphic architecture : the bivortex WFS. This sensor employs charge-2 vortex masks. Simulations for an ideal system demonstrate that this sensor achieves unprecedented sensitivity, even surpassing the highly sensitive Zernike WFS class (especially for low spatial frequencies), while paving the way for new high-contrast architectures integrating simultaneous sensing and coronagraphy.

 - **Abstract**
 Radially extended disk winds could be the key to unlocking how protoplanetary disks accrete and how planets form and migrate. A distinctive characteristic is their nested morphology of velocity and chemistry. Here we report JWST/NIRSpec spectro-imaging of four young stars with edge-on disks in the Taurus star-forming region that demonstrate the ubiquity of this structure. In each source, a fast collimated jet traced by [Fe II] is nested inside a hollow cavity within wider lower-velocity H2 and, in one case, also CO ro-vibrational (v=1-0) emission. Furthermore, in one of our sources, ALMA CO(2-1) emission, paired with our NIRSpec images, reveals the nested wind structure extends further outward. This nested wind morphology strongly supports theoretical predictions for wind-driven accretion and underscores the need for theoretical work to assess the role of winds in the formation and evolution of planetary systems

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the kinematics and star formation history of the Scorpius Centaurus (Sco-Cen) OB association following the initial identification of sequential, linearly aligned chains of clusters. Building upon our characterization of the Corona Australis (CrA) chain, we now analyze two additional major cluster chains that exhibit similar characteristics: the Lower Centaurus Crux (LCC) and Upper Scorpius (Upper Sco) chains. All three cluster chains display distinct sequential patterns in 1) the 3D spatial distribution, 2) age, 3) velocity, and 4) mass. The Upper-Sco chain is the most massive and complex cluster chain, possibly consisting of two or more overlapping subchains. We discuss the possible formation of cluster chains and argue for a scenario where feedback from the most massive star formation episode 15 Myr ago initiated the formation of these spatio-temporal cluster sequences. Our results identify cluster chains as a distinct type of stellar structure with well-defined physical properties, formed in environments capable of sustaining stellar feedback over timescales of 5-10 Myr. We find that around 40% of the stellar population in Sco-Cen formed due to triggered star formation, with 35% forming along the three cluster chains. We conclude that cluster chains could be common structures in OB associations, particularly in regions that have similar natal environments as Sco-Cen. Beyond their significance for star formation and stellar feedback, they appear to be promising laboratories for chemical enrichment and the transport of elements from one generation to the next in the same star-forming region.
