 - **Abstract**
 Configurations where two spacecraft, such as Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO), are radially aligned provide opportunities to study the evolution of a single solar wind parcel during so called plasma line-ups. The most critical part of such studies is arguably the identification of what can be considered a same plasma crossing both spacecraft. We present here a method that allowed us to find what we believe to be the same plasma parcel passing through PSP ($\sim 0.075$ au) and SolO ($\sim 0.9$ au) after their radial alignment the 29/04/2021. We started by modeling the plasma propagation in order to get a first estimation of the plasma line-up intervals. The identification of the same density structure passing through the two spacecraft allows to precise and confirm this estimation. Our main finding is how stable the density structure is, remaining well recognizable from PSP to SolO despite its $\sim 137$ hours journey in the inner heliosphere. We moreover found that the studied slow solar wind plasma parcel undergone a significant acceleration (from $\sim 200$ to $\sim 300$ km/s) during its propagation.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate modelling of spectra produced by X-ray sources requires the use of Monte-Carlo simulations. These simulations need to evaluate physical processes, such as those occurring in accretion processes around compact objects by sampling a number of different probability distributions. This is computationally time-consuming and could be sped up if replaced by neural networks. We demonstrate, on an example of the Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution that describes the speed of relativistic electrons, that the generative adversarial network (GAN) is capable of statistically replicating the distribution. The average value of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is 0.5 for samples generated by the neural network, showing that the generated distribution cannot be distinguished from the true distribution.

 Policy Brief on "Global Data in Astronomy: Challenges and Opportunities", distilled from the corresponding panel that was part of the discussions during S20 Policy Webinar on Astroinformatics for Sustainable Development held on 6-7 July 2023. Astronomy is increasingly becoming a data-driven science. Advances in our understanding of the physical mechanisms at work in the Universe require building ever-more sensitive telescopes to gather observations of the cosmos to test and advance our theoretical models of how the universe works. To confront the observed data with our theoretical models we require data hosting, archiving and storage and high-performance computing resources to run the theoretical calculations and compare our simulated and observed universe. We also require the sophisticated development of highly skilled human resources. Newer large projects are often run through international collaborations and partnerships, driving a need for 'open science' and collaborative structure across national boundaries. While astronomical data are useful scientifically, the data do not come with the same ethical/privacy-related restrictions as medical/biological data. Moreover, the ability to use data for new scientific analysis extends and expands the impact and reach of scientific surveys -- this is a strength that national funding agencies should capitalize on. We discuss the management and analysis of such large volumes of data and the corresponding significant challenges that require policy-level preparations. The policy webinar took place during the G20 presidency in India (2023). A summary based on the seven panels can be found here: arxiv:2401.04623.

 - **Abstract**
 The Astro 2020 Decadal Survey "Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 2020s" has recommended that "after a successful mission and technology maturation program, NASA should embark on a program to realize a mission to search for biosignatures from a robust number of about ~25 habitable zone planets and to be a transformative facility for general astrophysics," and prescribing that the high-contrast direct imaging mission would have "a target off-axis inscribed diameter of approximately 6 meters." The Decadal Survey assumed an exo-Earth frequency of ~25%, requiring that approximately 100 cumulative habitable zones of nearby stars should be surveyed. Surveying the nearby bright stars, and taking into account inputs from the LUVOIR and HabEx mission studies (but without being overly prescriptive in the required starlight suppression technology or requirements), we compile a list of 164 stars whose exo-Earths would be the most accessible for a systematic imaging survey of habitable zones with a 6-m-class space telescope in terms of angular separation, planet brightness in reflected light, and planet-star brightness ratio. We compile this star list to motivate observations and analysis to help inform observatory design (mission-enabling "precursor science") and enhance the science return of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) survey for exo-Earths (mission-enhancing "preparatory science"). It is anticipated that this list of target stars and their properties will be updated periodically by the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program.
#### Pre-perihelion Monitoring of Interstellar Comet 2I/Borisov

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of interstellar comet 2I/Borisov offered the unique opportunity to obtain a detailed analysis of an object coming from another planetary system, and leaving behind material in our interplanetary space. We continuously observed 2I/Borisov between October 3 and December 13, 2019 using the 1.52-m Telescopio Carlos S\'{a}nchez equipped with MuSCAT2 instrument, and the 2.54-m Isaac Newton Telescope with Wide Field Camera. We characterize its morphology and spectro-photometric features using the data gathered during this extended campaign. Simultaneous imaging in four bands ($g$, $r$, $i$, and $z_s$) reveals a homogeneous composition and a reddish hue, resembling Solar System comets, and as well a diffuse profile exhibiting familiar cometary traits. We discern a stationary trend fluctuating around a constant activity level throughout October and November 2019. Subsequently, a reduction in activity is observed in December. Dust production and mass loss calculations indicate approximately an average of 4 kg/s before perihelion, while after perihelion the net mass loss is about 0.6 kg/s. Our simulations indicate the most probable size of coma dust particles should be in the range 200-250 nm, and the terminal speed around 300 m/s. The spectrum acquired with the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope shows the presence of a strong CN line for which we find a gas production rate of $1.2 \times 10^{24}~s^{-1}$. We also detected NH$_2$ and OI bands. The ratio between NH$_2$ and CN productions is $\log (NH_2/CN) =-0.2$. Overall, this observing campaign provides a new understanding of 2I/Borisov's unique characteristics and activity patterns.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore three-body binary formation (3BBF), the formation of a bound system via gravitational scattering of three initially unbound bodies (3UB), using direct numerical integrations. For the first time, we consider systems with unequal masses, as well as finite-size and post-Newtonian effects. Our analytically derived encounter rates and numerical scattering results reproduce the 3BBF rate predicted by Goodman & Hut (1993) for hard binaries in dense star clusters. We find that 3BBF occurs overwhelmingly through nonresonant encounters and that the two most massive bodies are never the most likely to bind. Instead, 3BBF favors pairing the two least massive bodies (for wide binaries) or the most plus least massive bodies (for hard binaries). 3BBF overwhelmingly favors wide binary formation with super-thermal eccentricities, perhaps helping to explain the eccentric wide binaries observed by Gaia. Hard binaries form much more rarely, but with a thermal eccentricity distribution. The semimajor axis distribution scales cumulatively as $a^3$ for hard and slightly wider binaries. Though mergers are rare between black holes when including relativistic effects, direct collisions occur frequently between main-sequence stars -- more often than hard 3BBF. Yet, these collisions do not significantly suppress hard 3BBF at the low velocity dispersions typical of open or globular clusters. Energy dissipation through gravitational radiation leads to a small probability of a bound, hierarchical triple system forming directly from 3UB.
#### Emulating the interstellar medium chemistry with neural operators

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy formation and evolution critically depend on understanding the complex photo-chemical processes that govern the evolution and thermodynamics of the InterStellar Medium (ISM). Computationally, solving chemistry is among the most heavy tasks in cosmological and astrophysical simulations. The evolution of such non-equilibrium photo-chemical network relies on implicit, precise, computationally costly, ordinary differential equations (ODE) solvers. Here, we aim at substituting such procedural solvers with fast, pre-trained, emulators based on neural operators. We emulate a non-equilibrium chemical network up to H$_2$ formation (9 species, 52 reactions) by adopting the DeepONet formalism, i.e. by splitting the ODE solver operator that maps the initial conditions and time evolution into a tensor product of two neural networks. We use $\texttt{KROME}$ to generate a training set spanning $-2\leq \log(n/\mathrm{cm}^{-3}) \leq 3.5$, $\log(20) \leq\log(T/\mathrm{K}) \leq 5.5$, $-6 \leq \log(n_i/n) < 0$, and by adopting an incident radiation field $\textbf{F}$ sampled in 10 energy bins with a continuity prior. We separately train the solver for $T$ and each $n_i$ for $\simeq 4.34\,\rm GPUhrs$. Compared with the reference solutions obtained by $\texttt{KROME}$ for single zone models, the typical precision obtained is of order $10^{-2}$, i.e. the $10 \times$ better with a training that is $40 \times$ less costly with respect to previous emulators which however considered only a fixed $\mathbf{F}$. The present model achieves a speed-up of a factor of $128 \times$ with respect to stiff ODE solvers. Our neural emulator represents a significant leap forward in the modeling of ISM chemistry, offering a good balance of precision, versatility, and computational efficiency.
#### Investigating the Chemically Homogeneous Evolution Channel and its Role  in the Formation of the Enigmatic Binary Black Hole Progenitor Candidate HD  5980

 - **Abstract**
 Chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) is a promising channel for forming massive binary black holes. The enigmatic, massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) binary HD 5980 A&B has been proposed to have formed through this channel. We investigate this claim by comparing its observed parameters with CHE models. Using MESA, we simulate grids of close massive binaries then use a Bayesian approach to compare them with the stars' observed orbital period, masses, luminosities, and hydrogen surface abundances. The most probable models, given the observational data, have initial periods ~3 days, widening to the present-day ~20 day orbit as a result of mass loss -- correspondingly, they have very high initial stellar masses ($\gtrsim$150 M$_\odot$). We explore variations in stellar wind-mass loss and internal mixing efficiency, and find that models assuming enhanced mass-loss are greatly favored to explain HD 5980, while enhanced mixing is only slightly favoured over our fiducial assumptions. Our most probable models slightly underpredict the hydrogen surface abundances. Regardless of its prior history, this system is a likely binary black hole progenitor. We model its further evolution under our fiducial and enhanced wind assumptions, finding that both stars produce black holes with masses ~19-37 M$_\odot$. The projected final orbit is too wide to merge within a Hubble time through gravitational waves alone. However, the system is thought to be part of a 2+2 hierarchical multiple. We speculate that secular effects with the (possible) third and fourth companions may drive the system to promptly become a gravitational-wave source.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational-wave detectors are unveiling a population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to redshifts $z \approx 1$, and are starting to constrain how the BBH population evolves with redshift. We present predictions for the redshift evolution of the BBH mass and spin distributions for systems originating from dense star clusters. Utilizing a grid of 144 state-of-the-art dynamical models for globular clusters, we demonstrate that BBH merger rates peak at higher redshifts for larger black hole primary masses $M_1$. Specifically, for $M_1\gtrsim40\,M_{\odot}$, the BBH merger rate reaches its peak at redshift $z\approx2.1$, while for $M_1\lesssim20\,M_{\odot}$, the peak occurs at $z\approx1.1$, assuming that the cluster formation rate peaks at $z=2.2$. The average BBH primary mass also increases from $\sim 10\,M_{\odot}$ at $z=0$ to $\sim 30\,M_{\odot}$ at $z=10$. We show that $\sim 20\%$ BBHs contain massive remnants from next-generation mergers, with this fraction increasing (decreasing) for larger (smaller) primary masses. This difference is not large enough to significantly alter the effective spins of the BBH population originating from globular clusters, and we find that their effective spin distribution does not evolve across cosmic time. These findings can be used to distinguish BBHs from dense star clusters by future gravitational wave observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Current methods to characterize embedded planets in protoplanetary disc observations are severely limited either in their ability to fully account for the observed complex physics or in their computational and time costs. To address this shortcoming, we developed DBNets: a deep learning tool, based on convolutional neural networks, that analyses substructures observed in the dust continuum emission of protoplanetary discs to quickly infer the mass of allegedly embedded planets. We focussed on developing a method to reliably quantify not only the planet mass, but also the associated uncertainty introduced by our modelling and adopted techniques. Our tests gave promising results achieving an 87% reduction of the log Mp mean squared error with respect to an analytical formula fitted on the same data (DBNets metrics: lmse 0.016, r2-score 97%). With the goal of providing the final user of DBNets with all the tools needed to interpret their measurements and decide on their significance, we extensively tested our tool on out-of-distribution data. We found that DBNets can identify inputs strongly outside its training scope returning an uncertainty above a specific threshold and we thus provided a rejection criterion that helps determine the significance of the results obtained. Additionally, we outlined some limitations of our tool: it can be reliably applied only on discs observed with inclinations below approximately 60{\deg}, in the optically thin regime, with a resolution 8 times better than the gap radial location and with a signal-to-noise ratio higher than approximately ten. Finally, we applied DBNets to 33 actual observations of protoplanetary discs measuring the mass of 48 proposed planets and comparing our results with the available literature. We confirmed that most of the observed gaps imply planets in the sub-Jupiter regime. DBNets is publicly available at dbnets.fisica.unimi.it.
#### The interaction of a large-scale nuclear wind with the high velocity HII  region G0.17+0.15

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the nature of a Galactic center source, G0.17+0.15, lying along the northern extension of the Radio Arc near l~0.2deg. G0.17+0.15 is an HII region located toward the eastern edge of the radio bubble, embedded within the highly polarized Galactic center eastern Lobe where a number of radio filaments appear to cross through the HII region. We report the detection of hydrogen and helium recombination lines with a radial velocity exceeding 140 km/s based on GBT and VLA observations. The morphology of G0.17+0.15, aided by kinematics, and spectral index characteristics, suggests the presence of an external pressure dragging and shredding the ionized gas. We argue that this ionized cloud is interacting with a bundle of radio filaments and is entrained by the ram pressure of the radio bubble, which itself is thought to be produced by cosmic-ray driven outflows at the Galactic center. In this interpretation, the gas streamers on the western side of G0.17+0.15 are stripped, accelerated from 0 to deltav~35 km/s, over a time scale roughly 8x10^4 years, implying that ablating ram pressure is ~700 eV cm-3, comparable to the ~10^3 eV cm-3 cosmic-ray driven wind pressure in the Galactic center region.
#### Numerical Challenges in Modeling Gravothermal Collapse in  Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos

 - **Abstract**
 When dark matter has a large cross section for self scattering, halos can undergo a process known as gravothermal core collapse, where the inner core rapidly increases in density and temperature. To date, several methods have been used to implement Self-Interacting Dark Matter~(SIDM) in N-body codes, but there has been no systematic study of these different methods or their accuracy in the core-collapse phase. In this paper, we compare three different numerical implementations of SIDM, including the standard methods from the GIZMO and Arepo codes, by simulating idealized dwarf halos undergoing significant dark matter self interactions ($\sigma/m = 50$~cm$^2$/g). When simulating these halos, we also vary the mass resolution, time-stepping criteria, and gravitational force-softening scheme. The various SIDM methods lead to distinct differences in a halo's evolution during the core-collapse phase, as each results in slightly different scattering rates and spurious energy gains/losses. The use of adaptive force softening for gravity can lead to numerical heating that artificially accelerates core collapse, while an insufficiently small simulation time step can cause core evolution to stall or completely reverse. Additionally, particle numbers must be large enough to ensure that the simulated halos are not sensitive to noise in the initial conditions. Even for the highest-resolution simulations tested in this study ($10^6$ particles per halo), we find that variations of order $10\%$ in collapse time are still present. The results of this work underscore the sensitivity of SIDM modeling on the choice of numerical implementation and motivate a careful study of how these results generalize to halos in a cosmological context.
#### Fossil Signatures of Main-sequence Convective Core Overshoot Estimated  through Asteroseismic Analyses

 - **Abstract**
 Some physical processes that occur during a star's main-sequence evolution also affect its post main-sequence evolution. It is well known that stars with masses above approximately 1.1 $M_{\odot}$ have well-mixed convective cores on the main sequence, however, the structure of the star in the neighborhood of the convective core regions is currently underconstrained. We use asteroseismology to study the properties of the stellar core, in particular, convective boundary mixing through convective overshoot, in such intermediate mass stars. These core regions are poorly constrained by the acoustic (p) mode oscillations observed for cool main sequence stars. Consequently, we seek fossil signatures of main sequence core properties during the subgiant and early first-ascent red giant phases of evolution. During these stages of stellar evolution, modes of mixed character that sample the deep interior, can be observed. These modes sample the regions of the stars that are affected by the main-sequence structure of these regions. We model the global and near-core properties of 62 subgiant and early first-ascent red giant branch stars observed by the \textit{Kepler}, K2, and TESS space missions. We find that the effective overshoot parameter, $\alpha_{\text{ov, eff}}$, increases from $M = 1.0M_{\odot}$ to $M = 1.2 M_{\odot}$ before flattening out, although we note that the relationship between $\alpha_{\text{ov, eff}}$ and mass will depend on the incorporated modelling choices of internal physics and nuclear reaction network. We also situate these results within existing studies of main-sequence convective core boundaries.

 - **Abstract**
 The Skipper-in-CMOS image sensor integrates the non-destructive readout capability of Skipper Charge Coupled Devices (Skipper-CCDs) with the high conversion gain of a pinned photodiode in a CMOS imaging process, while taking advantage of in-pixel signal processing. This allows both single photon counting as well as high frame rate readout through highly parallel processing. The first results obtained from a 15 x 15 um^2 pixel cell of a Skipper-in-CMOS sensor fabricated in Tower Semiconductor's commercial 180 nm CMOS Image Sensor process are presented. Measurements confirm the expected reduction of the readout noise with the number of samples down to deep sub-electron noise of 0.15rms e-, demonstrating the charge transfer operation from the pinned photodiode and the single photon counting operation when the sensor is exposed to light. The article also discusses new testing strategies employed for its operation and characterization.
#### Chondrule Formation During Low-Speed Collisions of Planetesimals: A  Hybrid Splash-Flyby Framework

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12534
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12534
 - **Abstract**
 Chondrules probably formed during a small window of time $\sim$1-4 Ma after CAIs, when most solid matter in the asteroid belt was already in the form of km-sized planetesimals. They are unlikely, therefore, to be ``building blocks" of planets or abundant on asteroids, but more likely to be a product of energetic events common in the asteroid belt at that epoch. Laboratory experiments indicate that they could have formed when solids of primitive composition were heated to temperatures of $\sim$1600 K and then cooled for minutes to hours. A plausible heat source for this is magma, which is likely to have been abundant in the asteroid belt at that time, and only that time, due to the trapping of $^{26}$Al decay energy in planetesimal interiors. Here we propose that chondrules formed during low-speed ($\lesssim1$ km s$^{-1}$) collisions between large planetesimals when heat from their interiors was released into a stream of primitive debris from their surfaces. Heating would have been essentially instantaneous and cooling would have been on the dynamical time scale, 1/$\sqrt(G \rho) \sim 30$ minutes, where $\rho$ is the mean density of a planetesimal. Many of the heated fragments would have remained gravitationally bound to the merged object and could have suffered additional heating events as they orbited and ultimately accreted to its surface. This is a hybrid of the splash and flyby models: we propose that it was the energy released from a body's molten interior, not its mass, that was responsible for chondrule formation by heating primitive debris that emerged from the collision.

 Policy Brief on "Long Term Space Data and Informatics Needs", distilled from the corresponding panel that was part of the discussions during S20 Policy Webinar on Astroinformatics for Sustainable Development held on 6-7 July 2023. Persistent space data gathering, retention, transmission, and analysis play a pivotal role in deepening our grasp of the Universe and fostering the achievement of global sustainable development goals. Long-term data storage and curation is crucial not only to make the wide range of burgeoning data sets available to the global science community, but also to stabilize those data sets, enabling new science in the future to analyse long-term trends over unprecedented time spans. In addition to this, over the long-term, the imperative to store all data on the ground should be ameliorated by use of space-based data stores --maintained and seen to be as reliable as any other data archive. This concept is sometimes referred to as Memory of the Sky. Storing the data must be accompanied by the ability to analyse them. Several concepts covered below acknowledge roots and inspiration based in the Virtual Observatory effort. Within this policy document, we delve into the complexities surrounding the long-term utilization of space data and informatics, shedding light on the challenges and opportunities inherent in this endeavour. Further, we present a series of pragmatic recommendations designed to address these challenges proactively. The policy webinar took place during the G20 presidency in India (2023).

 - **Abstract**
 Our Sun lies within 300 pc of the 2.7-kpc-long sinusoidal chain of dense gas clouds known as the Radcliffe Wave. The structure's wave-like shape was discovered using 3D dust mapping, but initial kinematic searches for oscillatory motion were inconclusive. Here we present evidence that the Radcliffe Wave is oscillating through the Galactic plane while also drifting radially away from the Galactic Center. We use measurements of line-of-sight velocity for 12CO and 3D velocities of young stellar clusters to show that the most massive star-forming regions spatially associated with the Radcliffe Wave (including Orion, Cepheus, North America, and Cygnus X) move as if they are part of an oscillating wave driven by the gravitational acceleration of the Galactic potential. By treating the Radcliffe Wave as a coherently oscillating structure, we can derive its motion independently of the local Galactic mass distribution, and directly measure local properties of the Galactic potential as well as the Sun's vertical oscillation period. In addition, the measured drift of the Radcliffe Wave radially outward from the Galactic Center suggests that the cluster whose supernovae ultimately created today's expanding Local Bubble may have been born in the Radcliffe Wave.

 Giant planets grow by accreting gas through circumplanetary disks, but little is known about the timescale and mechanisms involved in the planet assembly process because few accreting protoplanets have been discovered. Recent visible and infrared (IR) imaging revealed a potential accreting protoplanet within the transition disk around the young intermediate-mass Herbig Ae star, AB Aurigae (AB Aur). Additional imaging in H$\alpha$ probed for accretion and found agreement between the line-to-continuum flux ratio of the star and companion, raising the possibility that the emission source could be a compact disk feature seen in scattered starlight. We present new deep Keck/NIRC2 high-contrast imaging of AB Aur to characterize emission in Pa$\beta$, another accretion tracer less subject to extinction. Our narrow band observations reach a 5$\sigma$ contrast of 9.6 mag at 0.6$''$, but we do not detect significant emission at the expected location of the companion, nor from other any other source in the system. Our upper limit on Pa$\beta$ emission suggests that if AB Aur b is a protoplanet, it is not heavily accreting or accretion is stochastic and was weak during the observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the crescent-shaped dust trap in the transition disk, Oph IRS 48, using well-resolved (sub)millimeter polarimetric observations at ALMA Band 7 (870 $\mu$m). The dust polarization map reveals patterns consistent with dust scattering-induced polarization. There is a relative displacement between the polarized flux and the total flux, which holds the key to understanding the dust scale heights in this system. We model the polarization observations, focusing on the effects of dust scale heights. We find that the interplay between the inclination-induced polarization and the polarization arising from radiation anisotropy in the crescent determines the observed polarization; the anisotropy is controlled by the dust optical depth along the midplane, which is, in turn, determined by the dust scale height in the vertical direction. We find that the dust grains can neither be completely settled nor well mixed with the gas. The completely settled case produces little radial displacement between the total and polarized flux, while the well-mixed case produces an azimuthal pattern in the outer (radial) edge of the crescent that is not observed. Our best model has a gas-to-dust scale height ratio of 2, and can reproduce both the radial displacement and the azimuthal displacement between the total and polarized flux. We infer an effective turbulence $\alpha$ parameter of approximately $0.0001-0.005$. The scattering-induced polarization provides insight into a turbulent vortex with a moderate level of dust settling in the IRS 48 system, which is hard to achieve otherwise.

 - **Abstract**
 Quantum diffusion describes the inflow of vacuum quantum fluctuations as they get amplified by gravitational instability, and stretched to large distances during inflation. In this picture, the dynamics of the universe's expansion becomes stochastic, and the statistics of the curvature perturbation is encoded in the distribution of the duration of inflation. This provides a non-perturbative framework to study cosmological fluctuations during inflation, which is well-suited to the case of primordial black holes since they originate from large fluctuations. We show that standard, perturbative expectations for the primordial black hole abundance can be significantly modified by quantum-diffusion effects, and we identify a few open challenges.

 - **Abstract**
 In radio astronomy, the science output of a telescope is often limited by computational resources. This is especially true for transient and technosignature surveys that need to search high-resolution data across a large parameter space. The tremendous data volumes produced by modern radio array telescopes exacerbate these processing challenges. Here, we introduce a 'reduced-resolution' beamforming approach to alleviate downstream processing requirements. Our approach, based on post-correlation beamforming, allows sensitivity to be traded against the number of beams needed to cover a given survey area. Using the MeerKAT and Murchison Widefield Array telescopes as examples, we show that survey speed can be vastly increased, and downstream signal processing requirements vastly decreased, if a moderate sacrifice to sensitivity is allowed. We show the reduced-resolution beamforming technique is intimately related to standard techniques used in synthesis imaging. We suggest that reduced-resolution beamforming should be considered to ease data processing challenges in current and planned searches; further, reduced-resolution beamforming may provide a path toward computationally-expensive search strategies previously considered infeasible.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first and deepest Australia Telescope Compact Array radio continuum images of the Honeycomb Nebula at 2000 and 5500 MHz solely from archival data. The resolutions of these images are 3.6 x 2.8 arcsec2 and 1.3 x 1.2 arcsec2 at 2000 and 5500 MHz. We find an average radio spectral index for the remnant of -0.76 +- 0.07. Polarisation maps at 5500 MHz reveal an average fractional polarisation of 25 +- 5% with a maximum value of 95 x 16. We estimate the equipartition field for Honeycomb Nebula of 48 +- 5 {\mu}G, with an estimated minimum energy of Emin = 3 x 1049 erg. The estimated surface brightness, {\Sigma}1 GHz , is 30 x 10-20 W m-2 Hz-1 sr-1; applying the {\Sigma}-D relation suggests this supernova remnant is expanding into a low-density environment. Finally, using Hi data, we can support the idea that the Honeycomb Nebula exploded inside a low-density wind cavity. We suggest that this remnant is likely to be between late free expansion stage and early Sedov phase of evolution and expanding into a low-density medium.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine over 68,000 refereed publications based on data from 25 missions in the ESA Science Programme and 11 additional missions in which ESA is involved as a junior partner. The publications cover the fields of astronomy, planetary science, and heliophysics and are spread over almost 50 years, spanning the period between the year a mission was launched and the end of 2021. We study the number of papers as a function of time and the evolution of several metrics, including citations and other indices. We also investigate the geographical distribution of the authors, and for ESA Member States we correlate the various indices with the level of financial contribution of the individual countries to the ESA Science Programme. We find that in general the involvement of the scientific communities in the various Member States follows the distribution expected from the countries' gross domestic products, with communities in some field and countries, both large and small, being particularly effective at turning data into scientific discoveries. We also analyse the differences between papers written by investigators directly involved in the provision of the payloads or in the definition of the scientific projects and those written by other scientists not directly involved in the process. We find that the latter, the so-called "archival papers", represent more than 50\,\% of the literature based on data from ESA Space Science missions, and have a similar impact on the literature in the respective fields, as judged by the number of citations. This highlights the importance of sharing and preserving the scientific data produced by the missions.

 - **Abstract**
 We have collected data pertaining to the Principal Investigators (PIs), and co-PIs (where appropriate) for all ESA-led Science Directorate missions since the first such launch, namely of COS-B in 1975. For a total of 28 missions (including 4 in preparation awaiting launch), 437 individuals have been recorded along with their institution, location, academic age and gender. We have correlated the number of PIs by country with the financial contribution of those countries to the ESA Science programme. We have also investigated issues associated with age and gender of the PIs. As a result of these analyses, we make suggestions for actions which ESA and its Member States may wish to consider with the aim of encouraging equity and diversity while still placing scientific excellence as the overarching goal.

 - **Abstract**
 After an introduction to the ESA Herschel Space Observatory including a mission overview, science objectives, results and productivity we examine the process and outcomes of the announcements of observing opportunities (AOs). For Herschel, in common with other ESA observatories, there were no rules, quotas, or guidelines for the allocation of observing time based on the geographical location of the lead proposer's institute, gender, or seniority (academic age); scientific excellence was the most important single factor. We investigate whether and how success rates vary with these (other) parameters. Due to the relatively short operational duration of Herschel -- compared to XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL -- in addition to the pre-launch AO in 2007 there was just two further AOs, in 2010 and 2011. In order to extend the time-frame we compare results with those from the ESA Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) whose time allocation took place approximately 15 years earlier.

 - **Abstract**
 We reexamine the SIMBAD database with incorporated Gaia DR3 parallaxes and proper motions. Appropriate query searches allow us to find several nearby stars with measured radial velocities having flybies within 1 ly from the Sun (in linear approximation). The closest past flyby $\approx 215.7$ kyr ago at $\approx 0.136$ pc is attributed to the star UCAC4 323-037188, currently located at 21.74 pc from the Sun. If the radial velocity of a star is unknown, we attribute to it an ``advantageous'' value of $\pm 50$ km/s. It allows us to create an additional list of ``Nemesis candidates'' for the perforation of the inner Oort cloud. The closest potential flyby at $\approx 0.015$ pc ($\approx$ 0.050 ly $\approx$ 3147 AU) from the Sun is attributed to GALEX J013712.5-012958 (Gaia DR3 2508809660245711360). It is currently located at the distance of about 111.1 pc and belongs to the Pisces-Eridanus stream. Also, close flybies of some massive bright stars (Algol, A-giant HD 107914, A-subgiant HD 2733 and B-subgiant HD 165704) are analyzed. Finally, we notice that B1-star BD+60 596, whose proper motions and radial velocity are both small, can be considered as the Sun's pseudo-stream companion.
#### Observed epochal variations in X-ray lines from the O Supergiant $ζ$  Puppis do not require substantial changes in the wind mass flux

 - **Abstract**
 We fit the high resolution \textit{Chandra} X-ray spectra of the O supergiant $\zeta$ Puppis using the variable boundary condition (VBC) line model to test the stability of its mass-loss rate between two epochs of observation: 2000 March and 2018 July -- 2019 August. At issue is whether the observed variations are induced by global changes in the cool (unshocked) wind itself or are isolated to the local pockets of hot gas (i.e., changes in the frequency and location of the shocks). Evidence in the literature favored the possibility of a 40 per cent increase in the mass flux of the entire stellar wind, based on X-ray reabsorption from a line-deshadowing-instability-inspired parameterization, whereas our fit parameters are consistent with a constant mass flux with a change in the velocity variations that determine the locations where shocks form. Our results suggest the shocks in the more recent data are formed at somewhat larger radii, mimicking the enhanced blueshifts and increased line fluxes interpreted in the previous analysis as being due to increases in both the X-ray generation and reabsorption from an overall stronger wind.
#### Lithium Cepheid V708 Car with an unusual chemical composition

 - **Abstract**
 The purpose of this work is to spectroscopically analyse the classical Cepheid V708 Car. A preliminary check of the spectrum of V708 Car showed that this is a lithium-rich supergiant. We also found that V708 Car has an unusual chemical composition in that the abundances of various elements correlate with their condensation temperatures. We tried to find an explanation of this feature, which is unusual for classical Cepheids. For the spectroscopic analysis, we used methods based on the assumption of local and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium. We determined the fundamental parameters of our program star V708 Car. This long-period Cepheid has a mass of about 12 M$_{\odot}$. We derived the abundances of 27 chemical elements in this star. They are clearly correlated with their condensation temperature: the higher the condensation temperature, the lower the abundance (there are exceptions for sodium and barium, however). We explain this peculiar chemical composition of the V708 Car atmosphere by the gas-dust separation in the envelope of this star. A similar mechanism leads to the observed peculiarities of the chemical composition of $\lambda$ Boo, W Vir, and asymptotic giant branch stars.
#### Towards a new model-independent calibration of Gamma-Ray Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 Current data on baryon acoustic oscillations and Supernovae of Type Ia cover up to $z\sim2.5$. These low-$z$ observations play a very important role in the determination of cosmological parameters and have been widely used to constrain the $\Lambda$CDM and models beyond the standard. To extend this investigation to higher redshifts, Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) stand out as one of the most promising observables since can probe the universe up to $z\sim9.4$. The use of GRB correlations is still a challenge due to the spread in their intrinsic properties. In this work, we propose an innovative and cosmology-independent method of calibration of the so-called 3D Dainotti correlation. We employ state-of-the-art data on Cosmic Chronometers (CCH) at $z\lesssim2$ and use the Gaussian Processes Bayesian reconstruction tool. To match the CCH redshift range, we select 20 long GRBs in $0.553 \leq z \leq 1.96$ from the Platinum sample, which consists of well-defined GRB plateau properties that obey the fundamental plane relation. To ensure the generality of our method, we verify that the choice of priors on the parameters of the Dainotti relation and the modelling of CCH uncertainties and covariance have negligible impact on our results. Moreover, we consider the case in which the redshift evolution of the physical features of the plane is accounted for. We find that the use of CCH allows us to identify a sub-sample of GRBs that adhere even more closely to the fundamental plane relation, with an intrinsic scatter of $\sigma_{int}=0.20^{+0.03}_{-0.05}$ obtained in this analysis when evolutionary effects are considered. In an epoch in which we strive to reduce uncertainties on the variables of the GRB correlations to tighten constraints on cosmological parameters, we have found a novel model-independent approach to pinpoint a sub-sample that can thus represent a valuable set of standardizable candles.
#### Effects of pair freeze-out on photon distributions in BBN epoch

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of non-extensivity in the photon distribution during the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) epoch using Tsallis statistics. Assuming a minimal deviation from the Planck distribution, we construct the perturbed Boltzmann equation for photons, including the collision terms for pair creation and annihilation processes. We analyze the possibility that these collisions could cause a slight increase in the number of high-frequency photons within the BBN era, and consequently, the primordial plasma might be temporarily placed in a state of chemical non-equilibrium. We also discuss the restoration of the photon distribution to an equilibrium state as the Universe enters the matter-dominated era. These findings, which suggest possible changes in the photon distribution during the epoch between the BBN and the recombination, offer insights that support the previously proposed ansatz solution to the primordial lithium problem in arXiv:1812.09472.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13190
 - **Abstract**
 Context. The presence of clouds during observations with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes can strongly affect the performance of the instrument due to additional absorption of light and scattering of light beyond the field of view of the instrument. If not corrected for, the presence of clouds leads to increased systematic errors in the results. Aims. One approach to correct for the effects of clouds is to include clouds in Monte Carlo simulations to produce models for primary particle classification, energy and direction estimation. However, this method is challenging due to the dynamic nature of cloudy conditions and requires extensive computational resources. The second approach focuses on correcting the data itself for cloud effects, which allows the use of standard simulations. However, existing corrections often prioritise limiting systematic errors without optimising overall performance. By correcting the data already at the image level, it is possible to improve event reconstruction without the need for specialised simulations. Methods. We introduce a novel analysis method, based on a geometrical model that can correct the data already at the image level given a vertical transmission profile of a cloud. Using Monte Carlo simulations of an array of four Large-Sized Telescopes of the Cherenkov Telescope Array, we investigate the effect of the correction on the image parameters and the performance of the system. We compare the data correction at the camera level with the use of dedicated simulations for clouds with different transmissions and heights. Results. The proposed method efficiently corrects the extinction of light in clouds, eliminating the need for dedicated simulations. Evaluation using Monte Carlo simulations demonstrates improved gamma-ray event reconstruction and overall system performance.

 - **Abstract**
 We collected near-infrared spectra of 65 cool stars with the NASA InfraRed Telescope Facility (IRTF) and analyze them to calculate accurate metallicities and stellar parameters. The sample of 55 M dwarfs and 10 K dwarfs includes 25 systems with confirmed planets and 27 systems with planet candidates identified by the K2 and TESS missions. Three of the 25 confirmed planetary systems host multiple confirmed planets and two of the 27 planet candidate systems host multiple planet candidates. Using the new stellar parameters, we re-fit the K2 and TESS light curves to calculate updated planet properties. In general, our updated stellar properties are more precise than those previously reported and our updated planet properties agree well with those in the literature. Lastly, we briefly examine the relationship between stellar mass, stellar metallicity, and planetary system properties for targets in our sample and for previously characterized planet-hosting low-mass stars. We provide our spectra, stellar parameters, and new planetary fits to the community, expanding the sample available with which to investigate correlations between stellar and planetary properties for low-mass stars.
