          Planet formation and long-term stability in a very eccentric stellar binary

 - **Abstract**
 Planets orbiting one of the two stars in a binary are vulnerable to gravitational perturbations from the other star. Particularly, highly eccentric companion stars risk disrupting planetary orbits, such as in the extreme system TOI 4633 where close encounters between the companion and a gas giant planet in the habitable zone make it one of the most fragile systems discovered so far. Here, we report that TOI 4633's planet likely survived these encounters throughout the system's age by orbiting retrograde relative to the binary, stabilised by the Coriolis force. Using direct $N$-body simulations, we show it otherwise tends to collide with the binary stars or becomes free-floating after getting ejected. A retrograde planetary orbit has profound implications for TOI 4633's formation and evolution, suggesting an extraordinary history where its eccentric companion was likely randomly captured after planet formation in a single-star system. Alternatively, if stars and planet are born in situ from the same gas clump, we show the planet must have formed at sub-snow-line distances, contrary to the conventional core-accretion model. Our study highlights the importance of considering the long-term stability ($\gtrsim\rm Gyr$) of planets in eccentric binaries and demonstrates that the mere existence in such dynamically hostile environments places strong constraints on their orbital configuration and formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of PSR J1947-1120, a new huntsman millisecond pulsar with a red giant companion star in a 10.3 d orbit. This pulsar was found via optical, X-ray, and radio follow-up of the previously unassociated gamma-ray source 4FGL J1947.6-1121. PSR J1947-1120 is the second confirmed pulsar in the huntsman class and establishes this as a bona fide subclass of millisecond pulsar. We use MESA models to show that huntsman pulsars can be naturally explained as neutron star binaries whose secondaries are currently in the "red bump" region of the red giant branch, temporarily underfilling their Roche lobes and hence halting mass transfer. Huntsman pulsars offer a new view of the formation of typical millisecond pulsars, allowing novel constraints on the efficiency of mass transfer and recycling at an intermediate stage in the process.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the result from the April 2024 observation of the low-mass X-ray binary GX 13+1 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), together with NICER and Swift-XRT coordinated observations. Two light curve dips were observed; during them, the harder Comptonized spectral component was dominant and the polarization degree higher than in the softer, off-dip intervals. Through a joint analysis of the three IXPE observations, which also included the dip from the first observation, we demonstrate that the polarization properties varied in response to the intensity and spectral hardness changes associated with the dips. The polarization degree attained values up to ~4%. The polarization angle showed a swing of ~70° across the dip and off-dip states, comparable to the continuous rotation seen during the first IXPE observation. We discuss these results in the context of models for polarized emission from the accretion disk and the boundary/spreading layer on the neutron star surface. We also draw attention to the role that an extended accretion disk corona or disk wind can play in generating high polarization degrees and, possibly, swings of the polarization angle.

 - **Abstract**
 [Abridged] Gas kinematics is a new, unique way to study planet-forming environments by an accurate characterization of disk velocity fields. High angular resolution ALMA observations allow deep kinematical analysis of disks, by observing molecular line emission at high spectral resolution. In particular, rotation curves are key tools to study the disk pressure structure and estimate fundamental disk parameters, as mass and radius. In this work, we explore the potential of a multi-molecular approach to gas kinematics to provide a 2D characterization of the HD 163296 disk. From the high quality data of the MAPS Large Program we extract the rotation curves of rotational lines from seven distinct molecular species, spanning a wide range in the disk radial and vertical extents. To obtain reliable rotation curves for hyperfine lines, we extend standard methodologies to fit multiple-component line profiles. We then sample the likelihood of a thermally stratified model that reproduces all the rotation curves simultaneously, taking into account the molecular emitting layers and disk thermal structure. We obtain dynamical estimates of the stellar mass $M_\star=1.89$ M$_\odot$, the disk mass $M_\text{d}=0.12$ M$_\odot$ and scale radius $ R_\text{c}=143$ au. We also explore how rotation curves and the parameter estimates depend on the adopted emitting layers: the disk mass proves to be the most affected by these systematics, yet the main trends we find do not depend on the adopted parametrization. Finally, we investigate the impact of thermal structure on gas kinematics, showing that the thermal stratification can efficiently explain the measured rotation velocity discrepancies between tracers at different heights. Our results show that such a multi-molecular approach, tracing a large range of emission layers, can provide unique constraints on the ($R,z$) pressure structure of protoplanetary disks.

          The $\texttt{MSG}$ model for cloudy substellar atmospheres: A grid of self-consistent substellar atmosphere models with microphysical cloud formation

 - **Abstract**
 State-of-the-art JWST observations are unveiling unprecedented views into the atmospheres of substellar objects in the infrared, further highlighting the importance of clouds. Current forward models struggle to fit the silicate clouds absorption feature at ~$10\,\mu$m observed in substellar atmospheres. In the MSG model, we aim to couple the MARCS 1D radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model with the 1D kinetic, stationary, non-equilibrium, cloud formation model DRIFT, to create a new grid of self-consistent cloudy substellar atmosphere models with microphysical cloud formation. We aim to test if this new grid is able to reproduce the silicate cloud absorption feature at ~$10\,\mu$m. We model substellar atmospheres with effective temperatures in the range 1200-2500 K and with $\log(g)=4.0$. We compute atmospheric structures that self-consistently account for condensate cloud opacities based on microphysical properties. We present an algorithm based on control theory to help converge such self-consistent models. Synthetic atmosphere spectra are computed for each model to explore the observable impact of the cloud microphysics. We additionally explore the impact of choosing different nucleation species (TiO$_2$ or SiO) and the effect of less efficient atmospheric mixing on these spectra. The new MSG cloudy grid using TiO$_2$ nucleation shows spectra which are redder in the near-infrared compared to the currently known population of substellar atmospheres. We find the models with SiO nucleation, and models with reduced mixing efficiency are less red in the near-infrared. The grid is unable to reproduce the silicate features similar to those found in recent JWST observations and Spitzer archival data. We thoroughly discuss further work that may better approximate the impact of convection in cloud-forming regions and steps that may help resolve the silicate cloud feature.

          Stellar X-ray variability and planetary evolution in the DS Tucanae system

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of four Chandra observations of the 45 Myr old DS Tuc binary system. We observed X-ray variability of both stars on timescales from hours to months, including two strong X-ray flares from star A. The implied flaring rates are in agreement with past observations made with XMM-Newton, though these rates remain imprecise due to the relatively short total observation time. We find a clear, monotonic decline in the quiescent level of the star by a factor 1.8 across eight months, suggesting stellar variability that might be due to an activity cycle. If proven through future observations, DS Tuc A would be the youngest star for which a coronal activity cycle has been confirmed. The variation in our flux measurements across the four visits is also consistent with the scatter in empirical stellar X-ray relationships with Rossby number. In simulations of the possible evolution of the currently super-Neptune-sized planet DS Tuc Ab, we find a range of scenarios for the planet once it reaches a typical field age of 5 Gyr, from Neptune-size down to a completely stripped super-Earth. Improved constraints on the planet's mass in the future would significantly narrow these possibilities. We advocate for further Chandra observations to better constrain the variability of this important system.

          A New Approach for Constraining Large-Scale Temperature Fluctuations in the Intergalactic Medium

 - **Abstract**
 The reionization of helium is thought to occur at $2.5\lesssim z\lesssim4$, marking the last phase transition and final global heating event of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Since it is driven by rare quasars, helium reionization should give rise to strong temperature fluctuations in the IGM between neutral and recently-ionized regions of order $\sigma (\ln T) \sim \Delta T/T = 20-50\%$. We introduce a novel method to search for reionization-induced temperature fluctuations in the IGM by using the effective optical depths of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest towards a large number of background quasars. Higher IGM temperatures give rise to lower effective optical depths in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, implying that temperature fluctuations will broaden the observed optical depth distribution. We measured the distributions of effective Lyman-$\alpha$ forest optical depths across $71$ X-Shooter spectra from the XQ-100 survey in four redshift bins from $z=3.76$ to $z=4.19$ and compared them to a large-volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. A good agreement is found between the observations and the simulation, which does not include temperature fluctuations; therefore, we do not detect a signature of helium reionization. We then post-process the simulations to include an increasing amount of temperature fluctuations until the model becomes inconsistent with the observations. We obtain tight constraints on $\sigma (\ln T) < 0.29 \ (<0.40)$ at $2 \sigma\ (3 \sigma)$ at $z=3.76$ when averaging over scales of $100$ comoving Mpc, and weaker constraints for higher redshifts and smaller scales. Our constraints are the tightest to date, and imply that either the IGM temperature contrast caused by helium reionization is less than $\sim30\%$, or that the process has not yet significantly started at $z=3.76$.

          Mind the gaps: improved methods for the detection of periodicities in unevenly-sampled data

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of periodic signals in irregularly-sampled time series is a problem commonly encountered in astronomy. Traditional tools used for periodic searches, such as the periodogram, have poorly defined statistical properties under irregular sampling, which complicate inferring the underlying aperiodic variability used for hypothesis testing. The problem is exacerbated in the presence of stochastic variability, which can be easily mistaken by genuine periodic behaviour, particularly in the case of poorly sampled lightcurves. Here we present a method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) modelling for period searches and characterization, specifically developed to overcome these problems. We argue that in cases of irregularly-sampled time series, GPs offer an appealing alternative to traditional periodograms, because the known distribution of the data (correlated Gaussian) allows a well-defined likelihood to be constructed. We exploit this property and draw from existing statistical methods to perform traditional likelihood ratio tests for an additional, (quasi-)periodic component, using the aperiodic variability inferred from the data as the null hypothesis. Inferring the noise from the data allows the method to be fully generalizable, with the only condition that the data can be described as a Gaussian process. We demonstrate the method by applying it to a variety of objects showing varying levels of noise and data quality. Limitations of the method are discussed and a package implementing the proposed methodology is made publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper aims to describe the Pointing Reconstruction Model (PRM) and the prototype Star Tracker, which will be mounted on LSPE-Strip, a microwave Q- and W-band CMB telescope planned for installation at the "Observatorio del Teide" in Tenerife. The PRM integrates information on the instantaneous attitude provided by the telescope control system to determine the actual pointing direction and focal plane orientation of the telescope. It accounts for various non-idealities in the telescope setup, represented by eight configuration angles, which will be calibrated using the Star Tracker. Following the derivation of the PRM formalism and its implementation, we investigate the pointing errors caused by incorrect calibration of these configuration angles to validate the required 1 arcminute maximum systematic pointing error for the LSPE-Strip survey. This paper also describes the main structure and operations of the Star Tracker and presents the results of a campaign of actual sky observations conducted with a prototype. The results demonstrate a Star Tracker RMS accuracy of approximately 3 arcseconds, while systematic errors remain below 10 arcseconds. Based on these results, we analyzed the problem of reconstructing the PRM configuration angles. Two methods for intercalibrating the Star Tracker's pointing direction with respect to the focal plane's pointing direction were examined: (1) observations of planets and (2) observations of a drone carrying both an optical beacon and a radio beacon. In the first case, an intercalibration accuracy between 1/3 arcminute and 1 arcminute is achievable. In the second case, the expected intercalibration accuracy ranges from 0.25 arcminute to 1 arcminute.

 - **Abstract**
 Irradiated brown dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between stellar and planetary atmospheres. We present high-quality $\mathit{HST}$/WFC3/G141 phase-resolved spectra of the white dwarf + brown dwarf binary GD 1400, covering more than one full rotation of the brown dwarf. Accounting for brightness variations caused by ZZ Ceti pulsations, we revealed weak ($\sim$1\%) phase curve amplitude modulations originating from the brown dwarf. Sub-band light curve exploration in various bands showed no significant wavelength dependence on amplitude or phase shift. Extracted day- and night-side spectra indicated chemically similar hemispheres, with slightly higher day-side temperatures, suggesting efficient heat redistribution or dominance of radiative escape over atmospheric circulation. A simple radiative and energy redistribution model reproduced observed temperatures well. Cloud-inclusive models fit the day and night spectra better than cloudless models, indicating global cloud coverage. We also begin qualitatively exploring atmospheric trends across six irradiated brown dwarfs, from the now complete "Dancing with Dwarfs" WD$-$BD sample. The trend we find in the day-side/night-side temperature and irradiation levels is consistent with efficient heat redistribution for irradiation levels less than $\sim$10$^9$ ergs/s/cm$^2$ and decreasing efficiency above that level.

 - **Abstract**
 The Rossiter-McLaughlin effect allows us to measure the projected stellar obliquity of exoplanets. From the spin-orbit alignment, planet formation and migration theories can be tested to improve our understanding of the currently observed exoplanetary population. Despite having the spin-orbit measurements for more than 200 planets, the stellar obliquity distribution is still not fully understood, warranting additional measurements to sample the full parameter space. We analyze archival HARPS and HARPS-N spectroscopic transit time series of eight gas giant exoplanets on short orbits and derive their projected stellar obliquity $\lambda$. We report a prograde, but misaligned orbit for HAT-P-50b ($\lambda =41^\circ\ ^{+10}_{-9}$), possibly hinting at previous high-eccentricity migration given the presence of a close stellar companion. We measured sky-projected obliquities that are consistent with aligned orbits for the rest of the planets: WASP-48b ($\lambda =-4^\circ\ \pm$ 4), WASP-59b ($\lambda =-1^\circ\ ^{+20}_{-21}$), WASP-140 Ab ($\lambda =-1^\circ\ \pm$ 3), WASP-173 Ab ($\lambda =9^\circ\ \pm$ 5), TOI-2046b ($\lambda =1^\circ\ \pm$ 6), HAT-P-41 Ab ($\lambda =-4^\circ\ ^{+5}_{-6}$), and Qatar-4b ($\lambda =-13^\circ\ ^{+15}_{-19}$). We measure the true stellar obliquity $\psi$ for four systems. We infer a prograde, but misaligned, orbit for TOI-2046b with $\psi=$42$^{+10}_{-8}$\,deg. Additionally, $\psi = 30^\circ\ ^{+18}_{-15}$ for WASP-140 Ab, $\psi = 21^\circ\ ^{+9}_{-10}$ for WASP-173 Ab, and $\psi = 32^\circ\ ^{+14}_{-13}$ for Qatar-4b. The aligned orbits are consistent with slow disk migration, ruling out violent events that would excite the orbits over the history of these systems. Finally, we provide a new age estimate for TOI-2046 of at least 700 Myr and for Qatar-4 of at least 350-500 Myr, contradicting previous results.

 - **Abstract**
 The OpenUniverse2024 simulation suite is a cross-collaboration effort to produce matched simulated imaging for multiple surveys as they would observe a common simulated sky. Both the simulated data and associated tools used to produce it are intended to uniquely enable a wide range of studies to maximize the science potential of the next generation of cosmological surveys. We have produced simulated imaging for approximately 70 deg$^2$ of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Wide-Fast-Deep survey and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope High-Latitude Wide-Area Survey, as well as overlapping versions of the ELAIS-S1 Deep-Drilling Field for LSST and the High-Latitude Time-Domain Survey for Roman. OpenUniverse2024 includes i) an early version of the updated extragalactic model called Diffsky, which substantially improves the realism of optical and infrared photometry of objects, compared to previous versions of these models; ii) updated transient models that extend through the wavelength range probed by Roman and Rubin; and iii) improved survey, telescope, and instrument realism based on up-to-date survey plans and known properties of the instruments. It is built on a new and updated suite of simulation tools that improves the ease of consistently simulating multiple observatories viewing the same sky. The approximately 400 TB of synthetic survey imaging and simulated universe catalogs are publicly available, and we preview some scientific uses of the simulations.

          A new algorithm for detecting X-ray shots in Cyg X-1

 - **Abstract**
 The short-term X-ray variability of Cyg X-1 can be interpreted as random occurrence of mini-flares known as the shots, whose physical nature is still unclear. We propose a new algorithm for shot identification in the X-ray light curve, based on baseline detection and template fitting. Compared with previous techniques, our algorithm allows us to detect shots with lower amplitudes and shorter time separations. With NICER observations, we find that, after correction for detection sensitivity, both the shot amplitude and recurrence rate are positively scaled with the mean count rate, while the recurrence rate has a much higher dependence on the count rate. These suggest that a higher mass accretion rate will drive more and slightly larger shots. We also find that the abrupt hardening near the shot peak found in previous studies is attributed to different shot profiles in different energy bands; there is no need to involve a rapid physical process to suddenly harden the emitting spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) enables high-angular-resolution observations in astronomy and geodesy by synthesizing a virtual telescope with baselines spanning hundreds to thousands of kilometres. Achieving high instrumental phase stability in VLBI relies on the generation of high-quality, atomic-referenced RF local oscillator (LO) and RF-comb signals for the effective downconversion of celestial RF signals and precise phase calibration, respectively. As observing frequencies move into higher ranges with wider bandwidth, conventional electronic methods face significant challenges in maintaining the quality of these signals. Here, we demonstrate that an optical frequency comb (OFC) can be used as a versatile tool to generate and distribute low-noise and atomic-referenced RF-comb and RF-LO signals in the VLBI telescope. Hydrogen maser-stabilized optical pulses are transmitted over a timing-stabilized fibre link from the observatory building to the VLBI receiver system at the telescope, where photodetection converts them into the required RF-comb and RF-LO signals. In VLBI test observation, we successfully detected VLBI fringes and extracted the RF-combs characteristics in a format suitable for VLBI instrumental phase calibration. These results highlight the high potential of OFC-based technology for enhancing next-generation broadband VLBI measurements, advancing astrophysical research and facilitating intercontinental clock comparison.

 - **Abstract**
 The ExoEcho project is designed to study the photodynamics of exoplanets by leveraging high-precision transit timing data from ground- and space-based telescopes. Some exoplanets are experiencing orbital decay, and transit timing variation (TTV) is a useful technique to study their orbital period variations. In this study, we have obtained transit middle-time data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations for 37 short-period exoplanets, most of which are hot Jupiters. To search for potential long- and short-term orbital period variations within the sample, we conduct TTV model fitting using both linear and quadratic ephemeris models. Our analysis identifies two hot Jupiters experiencing strong periodic decays. Given the old age of the host stars of the hot Jupiter population, our findings call for a scenario where HJs are continuously being destructed and created. Our study demonstrates the importance of incorporating high-precision transit timing data to TTV study in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the molecular environment of the supernova remnant (SNR) Kesteven 67 (G18.8+0.3) using observations in $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, HCO$^+$,and HCN lines and possible associated $\gamma$-ray emission using 16-yr Fermi-LAT observation. We find that the SNR is closely surrounded by a molecular belt in the southeastern boundary, with the both recessed in the band-like molecular gas structure along the Galactic plane. The asymmetric molecular line profiles are widely present in the surrounding gas around local-standard-of-rest velocity +20 km s$^{-1}$. The secondary components centered at $\sim$+16km s$^{-1}$ in the belt and $\sim$+26 km s$^{-1}$ in the northern clump can be ascribed to the motion of a wind-blown molecular shell. This explanation is supported by the position-velocity diagram along a line cutting across the remnant, which shows an arc-like pattern, suggesting an expanding gas structure. With the simulation of chemical effects of shock propagation, the abundance ratios $N$(HCO$^+$)/$N$($^{12}$CO) $\sim2.6\times 10^{-5}$--$3.6\times 10^{-4}$ obtained in the belt can be more naturally interpreted by the wind-driven bubble shock than by the SNR shock. The belt and northern clump are very likely to be parts of an incomplete molecular shell of bubble driven by O-type progenitor star's wind. The analysis of 0.2--500 GeV $\gamma$-ray emission uncovers a possible point source (`Source~A') about 6.5$\sigma$ located in the north of the SNR, which essentially corresponds to northern molecular clump. Our spectral fit of the emission indicates that a hadronic origin is favored by the measured Galactic number ratio between CR electrons and protons $\sim0.01$.

 Despite the broad successes of the flat $\Lambda$CDM model and its fitness to the various cosmological observations, it confronts challenges stemming from anomalies in the measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($\sigma_8$). These inconsistencies have necessitated a reassessment of the model parameters, with a particular focus on their potential dependence on redshift. This study pioneers a new investigation to probe this redshift dependency by generating mock data simulated from observational data of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) and cosmic chronometers (CC), thereby increasing the data density in this field. By sorting the data into high-redshift and low-redshift bins, we aim to refine the cosmological constraints on the parameters of the $\Lambda$CDM model and determine whether the noted dependence on redshift is due to a lack of high-redshift observational data or if they signify intrinsic issues within the model itself. Our approach employs the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to minimize the $\chi^2$ function, thus tightening the cosmological constraints. Our findings within the mock analysis reveal discrepancies between the values of $\Omega_{m0}$ and $H_0$ derived from the mock data bins with high redshift and low redshift, indicating the potential deviation of the standard $\Lambda$ CDM cosmology from the high-redshift SNIa and CC data. If this deviation proposes a new physics beyond the standard model, then with better quality future data tracking the new physics, these discrepancies will be statistically significant.

 - **Abstract**
 WASP-49Ab, a low-density, Saturn-like planet in a tight orbit around a Sun-like star within a wide binary system, is a compelling candidate for hosting a volcanic moon, as suggested by the detection of Doppler-shifted this http URL study evaluates the stability of potential satellites around WASP-49Ab under the influence of planetary oblateness, relativistic effects, and perturbations from a close companion star, focusing on their impact on light curve parameters such as transit duration and impact parameter variations, driven by the evolution of the planet's orbit in this extreme environment. Using N-body simulations and semi-analytical methods, we analysed moon's dynamics across varied initial conditions and gravitational frameworks including the potential of an oblate planet and the effects of the general relativity. We find that `selenity', a moon survival indicator, is high in close orbits with low eccentricity, near the Roche limit, especially for masses greater than Io's. Stability decreases as eccentricity or distance from the planet increases. Additionally, We observe a strong destabilising resonance near 1.4 planetary radii when planetary eccentricities are slightly greater than zero. This study confirms the potential for stable exomoons around WASP-49Ab despite its hostile environment, emphasizing the importance of incorporating diverse physical effects in stability analyses, aiding future detection efforts.

 - **Abstract**
 The existing single-pulse search algorithms for fast radio bursts (FRBs) do not adequately consider the frequency bandpass pattern of the pulse, rendering them incomplete for the relatively narrow-spectrum detection of pulses. We present a new search algorithm for narrow-band pulses to update the existing standard pipeline, Bandpass-Adaptive Single-pulse SEarch Toolkit (BASSET). The BASSET employs a time-frequency correlation analysis to identify and remove the noise involved by the zero-detection frequency band, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the pulses. The BASSET algorithm was implemented on the FAST real dataset of FRB 20190520B, resulting in the discovery of additional 79 pulses through reprocessing. The new detection doubles the number of pulses compared to the previously known 75 pulses, bringing the total number of pulses to 154. In conjunction with the pulse calibration and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulated injection experiments, this work updates the quantified parameter space of the detection rate. Moreover, a parallel-accelerated version of the BASSET code was provided and evaluated through simulation. BASSET has the capacity of enhancing the detection sensitivity and the SNR of the narrow-band pulses from the existing pipeline, offering high performance and flexible applicability. BASSET not only enhances the completeness of the low-energy narrow-band pulse detection in a more robust mode, but also has the potential to further elucidate the FRB luminosity function at a wider energy scale.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the spectral characteristics of the Be/X-ray binary system, EXO 051910+3737.7, in which Be/X-ray systems are the largest sub-class of high-mass X-ray binaries. Spectroscopic observations are taken by the Thai National Telescope (TNT) with a Medium-RESolution spectrograph (MRES) instrument for seven nights spanning from 2020 to 2021. Our primary focus is directed towards the analysis of two Balmer lines, namely H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$, given that Be stars typically exhibit emission features in at least one of these hydrogen Balmer lines during certain phases. Our observations reveal split Balmer emission lines throughout the entire duration of our monitoring. Double Gaussian profiles were employed for line fitting to characterize these lines. The presence of double peaks in the Balmer lines indicates the presence of asymmetries within the circumstellar disc. We then analyze V/R variations and the changes in H$\beta$ spectra. Our analysis of V/R variation which Violet (V) and Red (R) peak intensity components, revealed rapid fluctuations occurring within a single day, although determining the precise periodicity was constrained by instrumental limitations and the duration of observability. Furthermore, employing observed the wavelength differences ($\Delta\lambda$) in conjunction with typical Be star parameters allowed us to estimate the radius ($r_{\beta}$) of the H$\beta$ emitting envelope. The average value was calculated to be 2.585$r_*$, with a standard deviation of 0.050$r_*$.

          Dust processing in the terrestrial planet-forming region of the PDS 70 disk

 - **Abstract**
 Dust grains in protoplanetary disks are the building blocks of planets. Investigating the dust composition and size, and their variation over time, is crucial for understanding the planet formation process. The PDS 70 disk is so far the only protoplanetary disk with concrete evidence for the presence of young planets. Mid-infrared spectra were obtained for PDS 70 by the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2007 and 2022, respectively. In this work, we investigate the dust mineralogy through a detailed decomposition of the observed mid-infrared spectra. The results show that both the dust size and crystallinity increased by a factor of about two during the two epochs of observation, indicating evident dust processing in the terrestrial planet-forming region of the PDS 70 disk. The dust size (~0.8 micron) and crystallinity (~6%) in the PDS 70 disk are similar to those of other disks, which implies that the two nascent planets, PDS 70b and PDS 70c located at radial distances of ~22AU and ~34AU, do not have a significant impact on the dust processing in the inner disk. The flux densities at wavelengths longer than ~16 micron measured by JWST/MIRI are only ~60% of those obtained by Spitzer/IRS. Based on self-consistent radiative transfer modeling, we found that such a strong variability in mid-infrared fluxes can be produced by adjustments to the dust density distribution and structure of the inner disk probably induced by planet-disk interaction.

 We present axially symmetric analytical potential-density pairs with surface density similar to the Miyamoto-Nagai model, but with more realistic vertical structure. Our models closely approximate an exponential, a sech$^2$, or a cored exponential vertical density profile. The latter profile has a density core of adjustable width, which provides more flexibility when modelling galaxy discs.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper discusses a fast algorithm for analyzing the phases of a multi-tone phase calibration signal. The multi-tone method is superior to its single-tone counterpart. The PCal signal is a wide-band frequency comb derived from an ultra-stable frequency standard which is then coupled into the input stage of the radio astronomy receiver chain. The frequency comb allows to determine the signal delay, frequency response and phase shifts induced by the radio telescope instrumentation. The instrumentation delay is one of the several delay components that have to be compensated for in multi-telescope aperture synthesis. The frequency response also helps to monitor the instrumentation. To extract the information from the digitized baseband output of the receiver chain calls for fast numerical methods. A simple fast algorithm is presented in this paper. Two implementations are provided. One is based on precomputed look-up tables. The other is based on fast digital sinewave generators. Both lend themselves to parallel software processing on multi-core and SIMD-capable platforms as well as processing with FPGA gateware. We present optimized reference implementations for Intel/AMD, IBM Cell and nVidia GPU platforms.

 - **Abstract**
 The spectrum of cosmic-ray electrons depends sensitively on the history and spatial distribution of nearby sources. Given our limited observational handle on cosmic-ray sources, any model remains necessarily probabilistic. Previously, predictions were performed in a Monte Carlo fashion, summing the contributions from individual, simulated sources to generate samples from the statistical ensemble of possible electron spectra. Such simulations need to be re-run if the cosmic-ray transport parameters (e.g. diffusion coefficient, maximum energy) are changed, rendering any parameter study computationally expensive. In addition, a proper statistical analysis of observations and comparison with such probabilistic models requires the joint probability distribution of the full spectrum instead of only samples. Note that parametrising this joint distribution is rendered difficult by the non-Gaussian statistics of the cosmic-ray fluxes. Here, we employ machine learning to compute the joint probability distribution of cosmic-ray electron fluxes. Specifically, we employ masked autoregressive density estimation (MADE) for a representation of the high-dimensional joint probability distribution. In a first step, we train the network on a Monte Carlo simulation for a fixed set of transport parameters, thus significantly accelerating the generation of samples. In a second step, we extend this setup to SECRET (Stochasticity Emulator for Cosmic Ray Electrons), allowing to reliably interpolate over the space of transport parameters. We make the MADE and SECRET codes available at this https URL .

 - **Abstract**
 We report the X-ray spectral and timing analysis of the high mass X-ray binary EXO 2030+375 during the 2021 type-II outburst based on the Insight-HXMT observations. Pulsations can be detected in the energy band of 1-150 keV. The pulse profile shows energy and luminosity dependence and variability. We observed transitions in the pulse profile shape during the rising and the decaying phase of the outburst. The pulse fraction exhibits an anti-correlation with luminosity and a non-monotonic energy dependence, with a possible dip near 30 keV during the outburst peak. The hardness-intensity diagrams (7-10 keV/4-7 keV) suggest state transitions during the early and late phases of the outburst. These transitions are consistent with the luminosity at which the pulse profile shape changes occur, revealing the source reaching the critical luminosity and transitioning between super-critical and sub-critical accretion regimes. We performed the average and phase-resolved spectral analysis, where the flux-resolved average spectra show a stable spectral evolution with luminosity. The phase-resolved spectral analysis reveals that the dependence of spectral parameters on the pulse phase varies with different luminosities.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive comparison of different Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods, evaluating their performance on both standard test problems and cosmological parameter estimation. Our analysis includes traditional Metropolis-Hastings MCMC, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), slice sampling, nested sampling as implemented in dynesty, and PolyChord. We examine samplers through multiple metrics including runtime, memory usage, effective sample size, and parameter accuracy, testing their scaling with dimension and response to different probability distributions. While all samplers perform well with simple Gaussian distributions, we find that HMC and nested sampling show advantages for more complex distributions typical of cosmological problems. Traditional MCMC and slice sampling become less efficient in higher dimensions, while nested methods maintain accuracy but at higher computational cost. In cosmological applications using BAO data, we observe similar patterns, with particular challenges arising from parameter degeneracies and poorly constrained parameters.

 This paper investigates the formation, populations, and evolutionary paths of UltraLuminous X-ray Sources (ULXs) within Globular Clusters (GCs). ULXs, characterised by their extreme X-ray luminosities, present a challenge to our understanding of accretion physics and compact object formation. While previous studies have largely focused on field populations, this research examines the unique environment of GCs, where dynamical interactions play a significant role. Using the MOCCA Monte Carlo code, we explore how dynamics influences ULX populations within these dense stellar clusters. Our findings reveal that dynamical processes, such as binary hardening and exchanges, can both facilitate and impede ULX formation in GCs. The study explores the impact of parameters including the initial binary fraction, tidal filling, and multiple stellar populations on the evolution of ULXs. We find that non-tidally filling clusters exhibit significantly larger ULX populations compared to tidally filling ones. The results indicate that the apparent scarcity of ULXs in GCs may be related to the older stellar populations of GCs relative to the field. Furthermore, the study identifies a population of "escaper" ULXs, which originate in GCs but are ejected and emit X-rays outside the cluster. These escapers may significantly contribute to the observed field ULX population.

 - **Abstract**
 A consensus has been reached in recent years that binarity plays an important role in the formation and evolution of a significant fraction of planetary nebulae (PNe). Utilizing the archived photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility survey, we conducted a comprehensive data mining in search for brightness variations in a large sample of Galactic PNe. This effort leads to identification of 39 PNe, whose central stars exhibit periodic variation in light curves. Among these objects, 20 are known binary central stars of PNe, while the remaining 19 are new discoveries. Additionally, we identified 14 PNe with central stars displaying anomalous variation in light curves, as well as eight variables based on the high-cadence photometric data. Among the new discoveries of periodicity, we found compelling evidence of binary systems at the centres of two archetypal quadrupolar PNe. We also report on very peculiar brightness variation observed in the central core of the compact PN NGC6833. Several PNe in our sample deserve follow-up observations, both high-dispersion spectroscopy and high-precision photometry, to reveal the true nature of their central binarity or even multiplicity.

          SkyReconNet: A Deep Learning Inpainting Approach for Enhanced CMB Map Reconstruction

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel neural network architecture, SkyReconNet, which is tailored to reconstruct missing information in the masked regions of the full-sky Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) map. Inpainting the CMB maps is a particularly formidable challenge when dealing with extensive and irregular masks, such as galactic masks which can obscure substantial fractions of the sky. Our network addresses this challenge by combining the strengths of the dilated convolutional layers, with their expanded receptive fields and standard convolutional layers, to capture both the global and local features in a CMB map. This hybrid design enables our network to accurately predict CMB fluctuations in the masked regions by effectively leveraging the information from the surrounding unmasked areas. The network is trained on simulated CMB maps generated using the Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background (CAMB) package. The galactic region of these simulated maps are excluded using the Planck 2018 common mask provided by the Planck CMB mission. During training, the network optimizes its weights by minimizing a composite loss function that combines the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and mean squared error (MSE). SSIM preserves the essential structural features of the CMB, ensuring an accurate and coherent reconstruction of the full-sky CMB map, while MSE minimizes the pixel-wise deviations, enhancing the overall accuracy of the predictions. The predicted CMB maps and their corresponding angular power spectra align closely with the targets, achieving the performance limited only by the fundamental uncertainty of cosmic variance. Our results demonstrate that this approach effectively addresses the challenges posed by large irregular masks, offering a significant inpainting tool in CMB and other cosmological analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Large spectroscopic surveys aim to consistently compute stellar parameters of very diverse stars while minimizing systematic errors. We explore the use of stellar clusters as benchmarks to verify the precision of spectroscopic parameters in the fourth data release (DR4) of the GALAH survey. We examine 58 open and globular clusters and associations to validate measurements of temperature, gravity, chemical abundances, and stellar ages. We focus on identifying systematic errors and understanding trends between stellar parameters, particularly temperature and chemical abundances. We identify trends by stacking measurements of chemical abundances against effective temperature and modelling them with splines. We also refitted spectra in three clusters with the Spectroscopy Made Easy and Korg packages to reproduce the trends in DR4 and to search for their origin by varying temperature and gravity priors, linelists, and spectral continuum. Trends are consistent between clusters of different ages and metallicities, can reach amplitudes of ~0.5 dex and differ for dwarfs and giants. We use the derived trends to correct the DR4 abundances of 24 and 31 chemical elements for dwarfs and giants, respectively, and publish a detrended catalogue. While we couldn't pinpoint the trends' origins, we found that: i) photometric priors affect derived abundances, ii) temperature, metallicity, and continuum levels are degenerate in spectral fitting, and it is hard to break the degeneracy even by using independent measurements, iii) the extent of the linelist used in spectral synthesis is essential for cool stars, and iv) different spectral fitting codes produce significantly different iron abundances for stars of all temperatures. We conclude that clusters can be used to characterise the systematic errors of parameters produced in large surveys, but further research is needed to explain the origin of the trends.

          Understanding what helium absorption tells us about atmospheric escape from exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric escape is now considered the major contributing factor in shaping the demographic of detected exoplanets. However, inferences about the exoplanet populations strongly depend on the accuracy of the models. Direct observational tests of atmospheric models are still in their infancy. Helium escape from planetary atmospheres has rapidly become the primary observational probe, already observed in $\gtrsim$20 exoplanets. Grounding our understanding in the basic physics of atmospheric escape, we present a new theoretical model to predict the excess absorption from the helium absorption line. We constrain the atmosphere properties, such as mass-loss rates and outflow temperatures, by implementing a Parker wind solution with an energy limited evaporating outflow. Importantly, we self-consistently link the mass-loss rates and outflow temperatures, which are critical to understanding helium absorption as the triplet-level population is typically exponentially sensitive to temperature. Furthermore, helium absorption is typically optically thin and the absorption is dominated far from the planet. Therefore, the absorption depth is not a measure of the size of the helium outflow. Our results indicate that for planets with a detectable signal, typically the helium triplet population in the atmosphere rapidly approaches a statistical equilibrium between populations by recombination and depopulation caused by electron collisions. We suggest that excess helium absorption can be quantified by a scaled equivalent width, which is positively correlated with the mass loss rate. We also show that the helium absorption scales with incident radiation, particularly with the XEUV to FUV flux ratios.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are a recently identified class of X-ray transient associated with tidal disruption events by supermassive black holes, and for which there are multiple possible explanations. In this paper we present a simple model which requires the black hole be spinning, be misaligned with the accretion flow (both conditions of which are almost certainly met) and that the accretion rate is a few times the Eddington limit. We speculate that the resulting Lense-Thirring torques force the disc and entrained outflows to precess, leading to increased X-ray flux when the wind-cone is oriented at lower inclinations to the observer. We test the range of parameters for which this model could explain the period and brightness of the QPE events discovered thus far, and make qualitative comparisons between the observed X-ray spectra and lightcurves to those extracted from GR-RMHD simulations. Overall, we find some areas of promising concordance, and identify challenges related to the details of current simulations.
