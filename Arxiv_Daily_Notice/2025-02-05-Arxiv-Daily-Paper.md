 - **Abstract**
 The process by which a system of non-luminous bodies form around a star is fundamental to understanding the origins of our own solar system and how it fits into the context of other systems we have begun to study around other stars. Some basics of solar system formation have emerged to describe the process by which dust and gas around a newly formed star evolve into what we see today. The combination of occultation observations and the flyby observations by New Horizons of the Cold-Classical Kuiper Belt Object (CCKBO), (498958) Arrokoth, has provided essential new constraints on formation models through its three-dimensional shape. We present a case that an occultation-driven survey of CCKBOs would provide fundamental new insight into solar system formation processes by measuring population-wide distributions of shape, binarity, and spin-pole orientation as a function of size in this primordial and undisturbed reservoir.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomical radio interferometers achieve exquisite angular resolution by cross-correlating signal from a cosmic source simultaneously observed by distant pairs of radio telescopes to produce a Fourier-type measurement called a visibility. Million Points of Light (MPoL) is a Python library supporting feed-forward modeling of interferometric visibility datasets for synthesis imaging and parametric Bayesian inference, built using the autodifferentiable machine learning framework PyTorch. Neural network components provide a rich set of modular and composable building blocks that can be used to express the physical relationships between latent model parameters and observed data following the radio interferometric measurement equation. Industry-grade optimizers make it straightforward to simultaneously solve for the synthesized image and calibration parameters using stochastic gradient descent.

 - **Abstract**
 The Teledyne COSMOS-66 is a next-generation CMOS camera designed for astronomical imaging, featuring a large-format sensor ($8120 \times 8120$ pixels, each $10 \mu m$), high quantum efficiency, high frame rates, and a correlated multi-sampling mode that achieves low read noise. We performed a suite of bench-top and on-sky tests to characterize this sensor and analyze its suitability for use in astronomical instruments. This paper presents measurements of linearity, conversion gain, read noise, dark current, quantum efficiency, image lag, and crosstalk. We found that the sensor exhibits nonlinear response below 5% of saturation. This nonlinearity is plausibly attributable to the trapping of electrons in each pixel. We developed and implemented a pixel-by-pixel nonlinearity correction, enabling accurate photometric measurements across the dynamic range. After implementing this correction, operating in the correlated multi-sampling mode, the sensor achieved an effective read noise of $2.9 e^-$ and dark current of $0.12 e^-/pix/s$ at $-25^\circ C$. The quantum efficiency exceeded 50% from 250 nm to 800 nm, peaking at 89% at 600 nm. We observed significant optical crosstalk between the pixels, likely caused by photoelectron diffusion. To demonstrate the sensor's astronomical performance, we mounted it on the WINTER 1m telescope at Palomar Observatory. These tests confirmed that the linearity calibration enables accurate stellar photometry and validated our measured noise levels. Overall, the COSMOS-66 delivers similar noise performance to large-format CCDs, with higher frame rates and relaxed cooling requirements. If pixel design improvements are made to mitigate the nonlinearity and crosstalk, then the camera may combine the advantages of low-noise CMOS image sensors with the integration simplicity of large-format CCDs, broadening its utility to a host of astronomical science cases.

 - **Abstract**
 Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are produced by the Hills mechanism when a stellar binary is disrupted by a supermassive black hole (SMBH). The HVS Survey detected 21 unbound B-type main-sequence stars in the Milky Way's outer halo that are consistent with ejection via the Hills mechanism. We revisit the trajectories of these stars in light of proper motions from {\it Gaia} DR3 and modern constraints on the Milky Way -- Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) orbit. We find that half of the unbound HVSs discovered by the HVS Survey trace back not the Galactic Center, but to the LMC. Motivated by this finding, we construct a forward-model for HVSs ejected from an SMBH in the LMC and observed through the selection function of the HVS Survey. The predicted spatial and kinematic distributions of simulated HVSs are remarkably similar to the observed distributions. In particular, we reproduce the conspicuous angular clustering of HVSs around the constellation Leo. This clustering occurs because HVSs from the LMC are boosted by $\sim300\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ by the orbital motion of the LMC, and stars launched parallel to this motion are preferentially selected as HVS candidates. We find that the birth rate and clustering of LMC HVSs cannot be explained by supernova runaways or dynamical ejection scenarios not involving a SMBH. From the ejection velocities and relative number of Magellanic vs. Galactic HVSs, we constrain the mass of the LMC SMBH to be $10^{5.8^{+0.2}_{-0.4}} M_{\odot}$ ($\simeq 6\times10^5 M_{\odot}$).

          TABASCAL II: Removing Multi-Satellite Interference from Point-Source Radio Astronomy Observations

 - **Abstract**
 In the first TABASCAL paper we showed how to calibrate in the presence of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) sources by simultaneously isolating the trajectories and signals of the RFI sources. Here we show that we can accurately remove RFI from simulated MeerKAT radio interferometry target data, for a single frequency channel, corrupted by up to 9 simultaneous satellites with average RFI amplitudes varying from weak to very strong (1 - 1000 Jy). Additionally, TABASCAL also manages to leverage the RFI signal-to-noise to phase calibrate the recovered astronomical signal. TABASCAL effectively performs a suitably phased up fringe filter for each RFI source which allows essentially perfect removal of RFI across all strengths. As a result, TABASCAL reaches image noises equivalent to the uncorrupted, no-RFI, case. Consequently, point-source science with TABASCAL almost matches the no-RFI case with near perfect completeness for all RFI amplitudes. In contrast the completeness of AOFlagger and idealised 3$\sigma$ flagging drops below 40% for strong RFI amplitudes where recovered flux errors are $\sim$10x-100x worse than those from TABASCAL. Finally we highlight that TABASCAL works for both static and varying astronomical sources.

          TRAPPIST-1 d: Exo-Venus, Exo-Earth or Exo-Dead?
 - **Authors:** M. J. Way
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 TRAPPIST-1 d is generally assumed to be at the boundary between a Venus-like world and an Earth-like world, although recently published works on TRAPPIST-1 b and c raise concerns that TRAPPIST-1 d may be similarly devoid of a substantial atmosphere. TRAPPIST-1 d is also relatively understudied in comparison with TRAPPIST-1 e. The latter has generally appeared to be within the habitable zone of most atmospheric modeling studies. Assuming that TRAPPIST-1 d still retains a substantial atmosphere, we demonstrate via a series of 3D general circulation model experiments using a dynamic ocean that the planet could reside within the habitable zone in a narrow parameter space. At the same time, it could also be an exo-Venus or exo-Dead-type world or in transition between between one of these. Studies like this can help distinguish between these types of worlds.

          Conservative limits on primordial black holes from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observations

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBH) may constitute a considerable fraction of dark matter. In this work we use the recent observations by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaborations to set direct limits on stellar-mass range PBHs. We evaluate the merger rates of PBH binaries. Those type of interactions contribute to what is a minimum of PBH merger rates at low redshifts detectable by LVK. Thus, they allow us to derive what is the most conservative upper limits on the presence of merging PBH binaries in the gravitational-wave observations. We study the cases where PBHs have a monochromatic mass-distribution and the case case with a distribution described by a log-normal function. To derive limits on PBHs, we simulate binaries with masses following the relevant mass-distributions and merger rates as a function of redshift, up to $z\sim 0.8$, relevant for the current LVK observations. In those simulations we also take into account that the LVK observatories measure the detected black hole binaries' masses with a finite resolution. In comparing to the LVK observations, we combine the simulated PBH binaries with the binaries following a power-law mass- and redshift-distribution. The latter binaries dominate the observed population of LVK detections. Our derived limits on the mass fraction of dark matter composed of PBHs is in the range of $10^{-3}$ to O(1), depending on the exact assumptions relating to the PBH binaries properties. For reasonable assumptions on those PBH binaries' properties before their evolution inside dark matter halos, we get that fraction to be in the range of $5\times 10^{-3} - 0.1$, for PBH masses of 5-80 $M_{\odot}$. Our limits even with a conservative choice on evaluating the low-redshift merger rates provide some of the most competitive limits in the mass range of 5-40 $M_{\odot}$. [abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 The next-generation mm/sub-mm/far-IR astronomy will in part be enabled by advanced digital signal processing (DSP) techniques. The Prime-Cam instrument of the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST), featuring the largest array of submillimeter detectors to date, utilizes a novel overlap-channel polyphase synthesis filter bank (OC-PSB) for the AC biasing of detectors, implemented on a cutting-edge Xilinx Radio Frequency System on Chip (RFSoC). This design departs from traditional waveform look-up-table(LUT) in memory, allowing real-time, dynamic signal generation, enhancing usable bandwidth and dynamic range, and enabling microwave kinetic inductance detector (MKID) tracking for future readout systems. Results show that the OC-PSB upholds critical performance metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while offering additional benefits such as scalability. This paper will discuss DSP design, RFSoC implementation, and laboratory performance, demonstrating OC-PSB's potential in submillimeter-wave astronomy MKID readout systems.

 - **Abstract**
 This manual is specific to the procedure of reducing galaxy long-slit spectroscopic data from the Boller and Chivens Spectrograph aboard the 90 inch Bok telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. The Image Reduction Analysis Facility (IRAF) is utilized to complete the steps of image reduction. This manual will discuss methods of removing instrumental signatures, correcting for radiation events from environmental conditions, and the data frames for wavelength calibration for the particular data presented. As a result, the reduced and calibrated image with a zoomed-in figure will present the h-alpha emission line and continuum of a galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 This study shows that the sputtering of hydrocarbon water ice leads to the production of mostly CO2, CO, and fragmented hydrocarbons. The onset of sputtered hydrocarbons is immediate, and quickly reaches a steady state, whereas CO2 and CO are formed more gradually. It is found that higher temperatures cause more sputtering, and that there are some notable differences in the distribution of species that are sputtered at different temperatures, indicating local heterogeneity of sputtering yields depending on the surface temperature.

          An embedded Disk (eDisk) in the IceAge: Investigating the jet and outflow from CED 110 IRS4

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study of the large-scale structure, jet and outflow morphology, and kinematics of the Class 0/I protostellar binary Ced 110 IRS4, using JWST NIRCam (F150W and F410M) and MIRI MRS observations from the JWST ERC program IceAge, along with ALMA data from the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) program. NIRCam images, combined with ALMA continuum and CO data, reveal arc-like structures ($\sim$1100 au), suggesting a dense envelope around the protostars. We detect disk shadows from both protostars in F150W. The MIRI MRS IFU data reveal a jet from both protostars in multiple [Fe II] lines, [Ar II] 6.99 $\mu$m and [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m, marking the first detection of a jet from the system. The [Fe II] (5.34 $\mu$m) jet from Ced 110 IRS4A has a width of $\leq$ 51~au at the protostellar location, with a large opening angle of 23\arcdeg{} $\pm$ 4\arcdeg. After inclination correction, the jet velocity is 124 km s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a dynamical timescale of 25 years. The molecular H$_2$ outflow displays a distinct morphology resembling two hemispheres placed back-to-back. The consistent H$_2$ emission extent across transitions, differing from previous observations of protostellar outflows detected with JWST, suggests that MHD disk winds may not drive the observed outflow. We find that the upper limit to the width of the outflow at the protostellar location is 130 $\pm$ 10 au which is smaller than the disk diameter of 183.4 {$\pm$ 0.4 au} but much larger than the width of the [Fe II] jet.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a correlation between the stellar metallicities and the mutual inclinations of multi-planet systems hosting short-period small planets (a/Rs<12, Rp<4Re). We analyzed 89 multi-planet systems discovered by Kepler, K2, and TESS, where the innermost planets have periods shorter than 10 days. We found that the mutual inclinations of the innermost two planets are higher and more diverse around metal-rich stars. The mutual inclinations are calculated as the absolute differences between the best-fit inclinations of the innermost two planets from transit modeling, which represent the lower limits of the true mutual inclinations. The mean and variance of the mutual inclination distribution of the metal-rich systems are 3.1+-0.5 and 3.1+-0.4 degrees, while for the metal-poor systems they are 1.3+-0.2 and 1.0+-0.2 degrees. This finding suggests that inner planetary systems around metal-rich stars are dynamically hotter. We summarized the theories that could plausibly explain this correlation, including the influence of giant planets, higher solid densities in protoplanetary disks around metal-rich stars, or secular chaos coupled with an excess of angular momentum deficits. Planet formation and population synthesis models tracking the mutual inclination evolution would be essential to fully understand this correlation.

 - **Abstract**
 The International Liquid Mirror Telescope (ILMT) is a 4-m aperture, zenith-pointing telescope with a field-of-view of 22', situated in the foothills of the Himalayas. The telescope operates in continuous survey mode, making it a useful instrument for time-domain astronomy, particularly for detecting transients, variable stars, active galactic nuclei variability, and asteroids. This paper presents the PyLMT transient detection pipeline to detect such transient/varying sources in the ILMT images. The pipeline utilises the image subtraction technique to compare a pair of images from the same field, identifying such sources in subtracted images with the help of convolutional neural networks (CNN) based real/bogus classifiers. The test accuracies determined for the real/bogus classifiers ranged from 94% to 98%. The resulting precision of the pipeline calculated over candidate alerts in the ILMT frames is 0.91. It also houses a CNN-aided transient candidate classifier that classifies the transient/variable candidates based on host morphology. The test accuracy of the candidate classifier is 98.6%. It has the provision to identify catalogued asteroids and other solar system objects using public databases. The median execution time of the pipeline is approximately 29 minutes per image of 17 minutes exposure. Relevant CNNs have been trained on data acquired with the ILMT during the cycle of October-November 2022. Subsequent tests on those images have confirmed the detection of numerous catalogued asteroids, variable stars, and other uncatalogued sources. The pipeline has been operational and has detected 12 extragalactic transients, including 2 new discoveries in the November 2023-May 2024 observation cycle.

          Predicting the number density of heavy seed massive black holes due to an intense Lyman-Werner field

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detections of a large number of candidate active galactic nuclei at high redshift (i.e. $z \gtrsim 4$) has increased speculation that heavy seed massive black hole formation may be a required pathway. Here we re-implement the so-called Lyman-Werner (LW) channel model of Dijkstra et al. (2014) to calculate the expected number density of massive black holes formed through this channel. We further enhance this model by extracting information relevant to the model from the $\texttt{Renaissance}$ simulation suite. $\texttt{Renaissance}$ is a high-resolution suite of simulations ideally positioned to probe the high-$z$ universe. Finally, we compare the LW-only channel against other models in the literature. We find that the LW-only channel results in a peak number density of massive black holes of approximately $\rm{10^{-4} \ cMpc^{-3}}$ at $z \sim 10$. Given the growth requirements and the duty cycle of active galactic nuclei, this means that the LW-only is likely incompatible with recent JWST measurements and can, at most, be responsible for only a small subset of high-$z$ active galactic nuclei. Other models from the literature seem therefore better positioned, at present, to explain the high frequency of massive black holes at high $z$.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring the properties of planets younger than about 50 Myr helps to test different planetary formation and evolution models. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has observed nearly the entire sky, including a wide range of star-forming regions and young stellar clusters, expanding our census of the newborn planet population. In this work, we present the discovery of the TIC 88785435 planetary system located in the Upper-Centaurus Lupus (UCL) region of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association (Sco-Cen) and a preliminary survey of the planet population within Sco-Cen. TIC 88785435 is a pre-main sequence, K7V dwarf ($M_\star = 0.72M_\odot$, $R_\star = 0.91R_\odot$, $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 3998K, V = 11.7 mag) located within the bounds of UCL. We investigate the distribution of rotation periods measured from the TESS long-cadence data and the Halpha and Li abundances from the spectra of TIC 88785435. TESS long-candence data reveal that TIC 88785435 hosts a transiting super-Neptune ($R_b = 5.03R_\oplus$, P = 10.51 days), TIC 88785435 b. Ground-based follow-up validates the planetary nature of TIC 88785435 b. Using the TESS data, we perform a preliminary survey to investigate how TIC 88785435 b compares to the population of newly born planets located within Sco-Cen.

          Constraints on Lorentz Invariance Violation from Gamma-ray Burst rest-frame spectral lags using Profile Likelihood

 - **Abstract**
 We reanalyze the spectral lag data for 56 GRBs in the cosmological rest frame to search for Lorentz Invariance Violation using frequentist inference. For this purpose, we use the technique of profile likelihood to deal with the nuisance parameters corresponding to a constant astrophysical spectral lag in the GRB rest frame and the unknown intrinsic scatter, while the parameter of interest is the energy scale ($E_{QG}$) for LIV. With this method, we do not obtain a global minimum for $\chi^2$ as a function of $E_{QG}$ up to the Planck scale. Therefore, we can set one-sided lower limits on $E_{QG}$ in a seamless manner. The 95% c.l. lower limits which we obtain on $E_{QG}$ are then given by $E_{QG}\geq 1.22 \times 10^{15}$ GeV and $E_{QG}\geq 6.64\times 10^{5}$ GeV, for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively. Therefore, this work represents yet another proof of principles application of profile likelihood in the search for LIV using GRB spectral lags.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of compact binary systems is largely driven by their evolution through a common envelope (CE) phase, crucial for understanding phenomena such as type Ia supernovae and black hole mergers. Despite their importance, direct observational evidence for CE material has been elusive due to the transient nature of these envelopes. Numerical simulations suggest that some envelope material may persist post-ejection. In this study, we investigate circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding hot subdwarf (sdB) stars, focusing on material ejected during the CE phase of binary evolution. We analyze Ca II K absorption lines in 727 sdB candidates from the LAMOST-LRS survey, selecting 145 stars with strong absorption features, indicating the presence of CSM. We compare the velocities of the Ca II K lines with the systemic velocities of sdB binaries, confirming that the material originates from ejected common-envelope material. The results show that the CSM persists long after the CE event, suggesting the formation of a stable, long-lived circumstellar environment around sdB stars. This study enhances our understanding of the role of CSM in post-CE evolution and provides new insights into the physical processes shaping the evolution of sdB binaries.

          Adiabatic Index in Fluid Models of Collisionless Black Hole Accretion

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 Models of highly sub-Eddington accretion onto black holes commonly use a single fluid model for the collisionless, near-horizon plasma. These models must specify an equation of state. It is common to use an ideal gas with $p = (\gamma - 1) u$ and $\gamma = 4/3, 13/9,$ or $5/3$, but these produce significantly different outcomes. We discuss the origins of this discrepancy and the assumptions underlying the single fluid model. The main result of this investigation is that under conditions relevant to low luminosity black hole accretion the best choice of single fluid adiabatic index is close to but slightly less than $5/3$. Along the way we provide a simple equilibrium model for the relation between the ion-to-electron dissipation ratio and the ion to electron temperature ratio and explore the implications for electron temperature fluctuations in Event Horizon Telescope sources.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we train score-based diffusion models to super-resolve gigaparsec-scale cosmological simulations of the 21-cm signal. We examine the impact of network and training dataset size on model performance, demonstrating that a single simulation is sufficient for a model to learn the super-resolution task regardless of the initial conditions. Our best-performing model achieves pixelwise $\mathrm{RMSE}\sim0.57\ \mathrm{mK}$ and dimensionless power spectrum residuals ranging from $10^{-2}-10^{-1}\ \mathrm{mK^2}$ for $128^3$, $256^3$ and $512^3$ voxel simulation volumes at redshift $10$. The super-resolution network ultimately allows us to utilize all spatial scales covered by the SKA1-Low instrument, and could in future be employed to help constrain the astrophysics of the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), consisting of a secondary (stellar mass) black hole (BH) orbiting around a supermassive BH, are one of the primary targets for future spaceborne gravitational wave (GW) detectors. The spin of the secondary BH encodes the formation history of the stellar mass BH and the formation process of the EMRI. In this work, we construct a kludge EMRI waveform model taking the secondary spin into account and forecast the measurement precision of the secondary spin by future spaceborne GW detectors with the Fisher information matrix. We find the secondary spin should be measured with a reasonably good precision for generic eccentric and inclined EMRIs, though the measurement precision largely degrades for low-eccentricity and nearly equatorial EMRIs. As an example of its astrophysical applications, we propose that the secondary spin can be used for distinguishing dry (loss cone) EMRIs (where the secondary BHs were born in the collapse of individual massive stars and are of low spin) and Hills EMRIs (where the secondary BHs are remnants of massive star binaries and the secondary spins follow a bimodal distribution).

 - **Abstract**
 The nearest spiral galaxy, M31, exhibits a kinematically hot stellar disc, a global star formation episode ~2-4 Gyr ago, and conspicuous substructures in its stellar halo, suggestive of a recent accretion event. Recent chemodynamical measurements in the M31 disc and inner halo can be used as additional constraints for N-body hydrodynamical simulations that successfully reproduce the disc age-velocity dispersion relation and star formation history, together with the morphology of the inner halo substructures. We combine an available N-body hydrodynamical simulation of a major merger (mass ratio 1:4) with a well-motivated chemical model to predict abundance distributions and gradients in the merger remnant at z=0. We computed the projected phase space and the [M/H] distributions for the substructures in the M31 inner halo, i.e. the GS, the NE-, W- Shelves. We compare these chemodynamical properties of the simulated M31 remnant with recent measurements for the M31 stars in the inner halo. This major merger model predicts (i) distinct multiple components within each of the substructure; (ii) a high mean metallicity and large spread in the GS, NE- and W- Shelves, explaining various photometric and spectroscopic metallicity measurements; (iii) simulated phase space diagrams that qualitatively reproduce various features identified in the projected phase space of the substructures in published data from the DESI; (iv) a large distance spread in the GS, as suggested by previous tip of the RGB measurements, and (v) phase space ridges caused by several wraps of the secondary, as well as up-scattered main M31 disc stars, that also have plausible counterparts in the observed phase spaces. These results provide further independent arguments for a major satellite merger in M31 ~3 Gyr ago and a coherent explanation for many of the observational results that make M31 look so different from the MW.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate the effect of Poisson noise, originating from the discrete distribution of stellar-mass primordial black holes (PBHs), on the abundance of ultradense dark matter halos (UDMHs). We incorporate the contribution of PBH shot noise into the power spectrum and modify the primordial power spectrum to calculate the differential mass function of UDMHs across various models, while accounting for crucial physical and geometrical factors. We further compare our results with observational constraints on the abundance of compact dark matter and the mass distribution of PBHs derived from the thermal history of the early Universe. Our findings demonstrate that the mass of PBHs contributing to Poisson noise plays a pivotal role in determining the abundance of UDMHs. Moreover, we show that Poisson noise from lighter PBHs strengthens the single-component dark matter scenario, whereas the corresponding effect from heavier PBHs supports the multi-component dark matter scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery that we live in an accelerating universe changed drastically the paradigm of physics and introduced the concept of \textit{dark energy}. In this work, we present a brief historical description of the main events related to the discovery of cosmic acceleration and the basic elements of theoretical and observational aspects of dark energy. Regarding the historical perspective, we outline some of the key milestones for tracing the journey from Einstein's proposal of the cosmological constant to the type Ia supernovae results. Conversely, on the theoretical/observational side, we begin by analyzing cosmic acceleration within the context of the standard cosmological model, i.e., in terms of the cosmological constant. In this case, we show how a positive cosmological constant drives accelerated expansion and discuss the main observational aspects, such as updated results and current cosmological tensions. We also explore alternative descriptions of dark energy, encompassing dynamic and interacting dark energy models.

          QUOKKA-based understanding of outflows (QED) -- III. Outflow loading and phase structure as a function of galactic environment

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from a suite of 3D high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of supernova-driven outflows from galactic disc regions with a range of gas surface density, metallicity, and supernova scale height. We use this suite to quantify how outflow properties -- particularly the loading factors for mass, metallicity, and energy -- vary with these parameters. We find that the winds fall into three broad categories: steady and hot, multiphase and moderately bursty, and cool and highly bursty. The first of these is characterised by efficient metal and energy loading but weak mass loading, the second by moderate loading of mass, metals, and energy, and the third by negligible metal and energy loading but substantial mass loading. The most important factor in determining the kind of wind a galaxy will produce is the ratio of supernova to gas gas scale heights, with the latter set by a combination of supernova rate, metallicity-dependent cooling rate, and the gravitational potential. These often combine in counterintuitive ways -- for example increased cooling causes cold clouds to sink into the galactic midplane more rapidly, lowering the volume-filling factor of dense gas and making the environment more favourable for strong winds. Our findings suggest that the nature of galactic winds is likely highly sensitive to phenomena such as runaway stars occuring at a large height and dense gas and are poorly captured in most simulations, and that metal loading factors for type Ia supernovae may be substantially larger than those for type II, with important implications for galactic chemical evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a transfer function-based method to estimate angular power spectra from filtered maps for cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys. This is especially relevant for experiments targeting the faint primordial gravitational wave signatures in CMB polarisation at large scales, such as the Simons Observatory (SO) small aperture telescopes. While timestreams can be filtered to mitigate the contamination from low-frequency noise, usual methods that calculate the mode coupling at individual multipoles can be challenging for experiments covering large sky areas or reaching few-arcminute resolution. The method we present here, although approximate, is more practical and faster for larger data volumes. We validate it through the use of simulated observations approximating the first year of SO data, going from half-wave plate-modulated timestreams to maps, and using simulations to estimate the mixing of polarisation modes induced by an example of time-domain filtering. We show its performance through an example null test and with an end-to-end pipeline that performs inference on cosmological parameters, including the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. The performance demonstration uses simulated observations at multiple frequency bands. We find that the method can recover unbiased parameters for our simulated noise levels.

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss the turbulent structure and dynamics of the upper solar convection zone using a 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulation model at 45 degrees latitude. The model reveals the self-formation of meridional flows, the leptocline, and the radial differential rotation. Unlike previous studies, the model shows a complex variation of the characteristic scales of turbulent flows with depth. In particular, an increase in the characteristic convective scale is trackable within an individual snapshot up to a depth of 7 Mm, near the bottom of the hydrogen ionization zone, where turbulent flows become weaker and more homogeneous. However, the turbulent spectra show an increase in scale with depth and a qualitative change in convective patterns below 7 Mm (near the bottom of the leptocline), suggesting changes in the diffusivity properties and energy exchange among different scales.

 - **Abstract**
 The total lunar eclipse on March 14, 2025 UT occurs nearly exactly 521 years (one Hypersaros) after a similar eclipse on March 1, 1504 UT that is renowned for its importance to the voyage of Columbus to Jamaica. Eclipses separated by a Hypersaros have similar depths, appear very close to the same location in the sky, and occur at nearly the same time of year. This paper summarizes the results from a search for analogous cycles within the Five Millennium Catalogs of Lunar and Solar Eclipses. Under the two simple constraints of similar eclipse dates relative to the vernal equinox and similar paths of the Moon through the Earth's shadow, the most common time intervals between lunar eclipses separated by less than 1000 years are the 521-year Hypersaros and a 633-yr period of the Icosa-Inex-Triple-Saros (IITS). Notable cycles at longer periods occur at 1154, 1284, 1787, 1917, and 2308 years.

 This study analyzes the multi-wavelength flaring activity of the distant flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) OP 313 (z=0.997) during November 2023 to March 2024, using data from Fermi-Large Area Telescope, Swift X-ray Telescope, and Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope. The analysis highlights two significant very high energy(VHE) detection epochs and GeV gamma-ray ?aring episodes, providing insight into jet emission processes and radiative mechanisms. Key findings include broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) evolution, including enigmatic X-ray spectral changes. Modeling of the multi-wavelength SED with a one-zone leptonic radiative processes attributes the emissions to synchrotron radiation, Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC), and External Compton (EC) mechanisms, with torus photons as the primary source for EC processes. The results suggest that the gamma-ray emitting region lies outside the broad-line region but within the dusty torus. Furthermore, we find that the radiated power is significantly smaller than the total jet power, suggesting that most of the bulk energy remains within the jet even after passing through the blazar emission zone. These findings advance our understanding of particle acceleration, jet dynamics, and photon field interactions in FSRQs.

 - **Abstract**
 K-dwarf stars are promising targets in the exploration of potentially habitable planets. Their properties, falling between G and M dwarfs, provide an optimal trade-off between the prospect of habitability and ease of detection. The KOBE experiment is a blind-search survey exploiting this niche, monitoring the radial velocity of 50 late-type K-dwarf stars. It employs the CARMENES spectrograph, with an observational strategy designed to detect planets in the habitable zone of their system. In this work, we exploit the KOBE data set to characterize planetary signals in the K7V star HIP 5957 (KOBE-1) and to constrain the planetary population within its habitable zone. We used 82 CARMENES spectra over a time span of three years. We employed a GLS periodogram to search for significant periodic signals that would be compatible with Keplerian motion on KOBE-1. We carried out a model comparison within a Bayesian framework to ensure the significance of the planetary model over alternative configurations of lower complexity. We also inspected two available TESS sectors in search of planetary signals. We identified two signals: at 8.5d and 29.7d. We confirmed their planetary nature through ruling out other non-planetary configurations. Their minimum masses are 8.80+/-0.76ME and 12.4+/-1.1ME, corresponding to absolute masses within the planetary regime at a high certainty (>99.7%). By analyzing the sensitivity of the CARMENES time series to additional signals, we discarded planets above 8.5ME within the habitable zone. We identified a single transit-like feature in TESS, whose origin is still uncertain, but still compatible within 1sigma with a transit from planet c. We have explored future prospects for characterizing this system, concluding that nulling interferometry with the LIFE mission could be capable of directly imaging both planets and characterizing their atmospheres in future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Protostellar jets driven by massive protostars are collimated outflows producing high-speed shocks through dense interstellar medium. Fast shocks can accelerate particles up to relativistic energies via diffusive shock acceleration, producing non-thermal emission that can originate ${\gamma}$-ray photons. HH 80-81 is one of the most powerful collimated protostellar jets in our galaxy, with non-thermal emission detected in radio, X-ray, and ${\gamma}$-ray bands. Characterize the ${\gamma}$-ray emission originated by the accelerated particles of the region is crucial for demonstrating the capability of protostars to accelerate cosmic rays. Aims. Our goal is to determine the particle distribution that is producing the ${\gamma}$-ray spectrum of HH 80-81 in order to ascertain the leptonic/hadronic origin of the ${\gamma}$-ray emission. We aim at associating the high-energy emission in the region with the HH 80-81 system, characterize its spectrum, and elaborate emission models based on what we expect from the diffusive shock acceleration. Methods. We use the 15 yr database provided by the Fermi-LAT satellite to study the high-energy emission of the jet, spanning from 300 MeV to 100 GeV. In addition, we perform a source association based on positional arguments. Then, we employ the naima and Gamera softwares to analyze the possible mechanisms that are producing ${\gamma}$-rays considering the ambient conditions. We perform a radiative fitting and study the nature of the particles behind the ${\gamma}$-ray emission. Results. By analyzing all the candidates to produce the ${\gamma}$-ray emission that we detect, we conclude that HH 80-81 is the most probable candidate to explain the ${\gamma}$-ray emission in the region. The detected spectrum can be explained by both hadronic and leptonic particle components.

 - **Abstract**
 The main goal of this work was to measure the masses and radii of white dwarfs that belong to widely separated, common proper motion binaries with non-degenerate companions. These can be assessed, independently from theoretical mass-radius relations, through measurements of gravitational redshifts and photometric radii. We studied 50 white dwarfs with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, performing a detailed analysis of high-resolution (R ~ 18,500) spectra by means of state-of-the-art grids of synthetic models and specialized software. Hence, we measured accurate radial velocities from the H-alpha and H-beta line-cores, thus obtaining the white dwarf gravitational redshifts. Jointly with a photometric analysis that is formalized by a Bayesian inference method, we measured precise white dwarf radii that allowed us to directly measure the white dwarf masses from their gravitational redshifts. The distributions of measured masses and radii agree within 6% (at the 1-sigma level) from the theoretical mass-radius relation, thus delivering a much smaller scatter in comparison with previous analyses that used gravitational redshift measurements from low-resolution spectra. A comparison against model-dependent spectroscopic estimates produces a larger scatter of 15% on the mass determinations. We find an agreement within ~10% from previous model-based, photometric mass estimates from the literature. Combining gravitational redshift measurements and photometric analysis of white dwarfs delivers precise and accurate, empirical estimates of their masses and radii. This work confirms the reliability of the theoretical mass-radius relation from the lightest to the heaviest white dwarfs in our sample (0.38-1.3 Msun). [abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamical tide consists of various waves that can resonate with orbital motion. We test this coupling of dynamical tide and orbital motion using a simple two-dimensional shallow water model, which can be applied to a rocky planet covered with thin ocean or atmosphere. Then we take the earth-moon system as a fiducial model to calculate the tidal resonances and orbital evolution. We find that tidal dissipation can even increase with increasing orbital separation because of the coupling of dynamical tide and orbital motion. We draw the conclusion that the coupling is not negligible to study the orbital evolution on secular timescale.

 We append an additional fifteen years (2009-2024) to the Chandra X-ray light curve of M31*, the supermassive black hole at the center of M31, the Andromeda galaxy. Extending and expanding on the work in Li et al. 2011, we show that M31* has remained in an elevated X-ray state from 2006 through at least 2016 (when regular Chandra monitoring ceased) and likely through 2024, with the most recent observations still showing an elevated X-ray flux. We identify one moderate flare in 2013 where the other nuclear X-ray sources are in low-flux states, making that flare a valuable target for followup with multiwavelength and multimessenger archival data. We extract a mostly uncontaminated spectrum for M31* from this observation, showing that its X-ray properties are similar to those observed at Sgr A* in its quiescent state by Baganoff et al. 2003. Furthermore, we find no substantial change in the source's hardness ratio in the 2006 and 2013 flares compared to the post-2006 elevated state, suggesting the these flares are increases in the regular X-ray emission mechanisms instead of entirely new emission modes. Our extended light curve for M31* provides valuable context for multimessenger or multiwavelength observations of nearby supermassive black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 A transiting planet was recently discovered around a star in the Taurus star-forming region, IRAS 04125+2902, making it one of the youngest known planets. The discovery paper cited two age estimates for IRAS 04125+2902, one based on a comparison to two sets of model isochrones in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram and a second age reported by an earlier study for a putative population in Taurus that includes IRAS 04125+2902 (D4-North). However, the model isochrones in question differ significantly for most temperatures and luminosities of young low-mass stars, and do not reproduce the observed sequences for the TW Hya and 32 Ori associations (10 and 21 Myr). Meanwhile, as found in my previous work, D4-North is a collection of field stars and fragments of several distinct Taurus groups and older associations, so its quoted age is not meaningful. The true parent population for IRAS 04125+2902 is a small group that is ~35 pc behind the L1495 and B209 clouds (B209N). I have analyzed the age of B209N through a comparison to TW Hya and 32 Ori. The M star sequences in the latter two associations have the same shapes, but the sequence for B209N is flatter, indicating that >M4 stars at ages of <10 Myr fade more quickly than stars at earlier types and older ages. For the one member of B209N that is earlier than M4 (IRAS 04125+2902), I estimate an age of 3.0+/-0.4 Myr based on its offsets from TW Hya and 32 Ori, which by happenstance is similar to the value derived through the comparison to model isochrones.

 - **Abstract**
 Following the discovery of the brightest high-energy neutrino sources in the sky, the further detection of fainter sources is more challenging. A natural solution is to combine fainter source candidates, and instead of individual detections, aim to identify and learn about the properties of a larger population. Due to the discreteness of high-energy neutrinos, they can be detected from distant very faint sources as well, making a statistical search benefit from the combination of a large number of distant sources, a called deep-stacking. Here we show that a Bayesian framework is well-suited to carry out such statistical probes, both in terms of detection and property reconstruction. After presenting an introductory explanation to the relevant Bayesian methodology, we demonstrate its utility in parameter reconstruction in a simplified case, and in delivering superior sensitivity compared to a maximum likelihood search in a realistic simulation.

 - **Abstract**
 The paper considers the implementation of the fast multipole method (FMM) in the PHANTOM code for the calculation of forces in a self-gravitating system. The gravitational interaction forces are divided into short-range and long-range interactions depending on the value of the tree opening parameter of the hierarchical kd-tree. It is demonstrated that Newton's third law holds for any pair of cells of the kd-tree engaged in mutual interaction. However, for the entire system a linear momentum is not conserved. As a result, there is an unphysical force that causes the center of mass to migrate. For example, for a pair of neutron stars, the displacement of the system's center of mass is found to be comparable to the radii of the objects at times of a few tens of Keplerian revolutions. This displacement cannot be reduced by increasing the number of particles for values of the tree opening parameter greater than 0.2. For smaller values, the time required for the calculation is significantly longer.

 In this work, the ability of rare VHE gamma ray selection with neural network methods is investigated in the case when cosmic radiation flux strongly prevails (ratio up to {10^4} over the gamma radiation flux from a point source). This ratio is valid for the Crab Nebula in the TeV energy range, since the Crab is a well-studied source for calibration and test of various methods and installations in gamma astronomy. The part of TAIGA experiment which includes three Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes observes this gamma-source too. Cherenkov telescopes obtain images of Extensive Air Showers. Hillas parameters can be used to analyse images in standard processing method, or images can be processed with convolutional neural networks. In this work we would like to describe the main steps and results obtained in the gamma/hadron separation task from the Crab Nebula with neural network methods. The results obtained are compared with standard processing method applied in the TAIGA collaboration and using Hillas parameter cuts. It is demonstrated that a signal was received at the level of higher than 5.5{\sigma} in 21 hours of Crab Nebula observations after processing the experimental data with the neural network method.

 - **Abstract**
 The fast and accurate estimation of planetary mass-loss rates is critical for planet population and evolution modelling. We use machine learning (ML) for fast interpolation across an existing large grid of hydrodynamic upper atmosphere models, providing mass-loss rates for any planet inside the grid boundaries with superior accuracy compared to previously published interpolation schemes. We consider an already available grid comprising about 11000 hydrodynamic upper atmosphere models for training and generate an additional grid of about 250 models for testing purposes. We develop the ML interpolation scheme (dubbed "atmospheric Mass Loss INquiry frameworK"; MLink) using a Dense Neural Network, further comparing the results with what was obtained employing classical approaches (e.g. linear interpolation and radial basis function-based regression). Finally, we study the impact of the different interpolation schemes on the evolution of a small sample of carefully selected synthetic planets. MLink provides high-quality interpolation across the entire parameter space by significantly reducing both the number of points with large interpolation errors and the maximum interpolation error compared to previously available schemes. For most cases, evolutionary tracks computed employing MLink and classical schemes lead to comparable planetary parameters at Gyr-timescales. However, particularly for planets close to the top edge of the radius gap, the difference between the predicted planetary radii at a given age of tracks obtained employing MLink and classical interpolation schemes can exceed the typical observational uncertainties. Machine learning can be successfully used to estimate atmospheric mass-loss rates from model grids paving the way to explore future larger and more complex grids of models computed accounting for more physical processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric characterization of Earth-like exoplanets through reflected light spectroscopy is a key goal for upcoming direct imaging missions. A critical challenge in this endeavor is the accurate determination of planetary mass, which may influence the measurement of atmospheric compositions and the identification of potential biosignatures. In this study, we used the Bayesian retrieval framework ExoReL$^\Re$ to investigate the impact of planetary mass uncertainties on the atmospheric characterization of terrestrial exoplanets observed in reflected light. Our results indicate that precise prior knowledge of the planetary mass can be crucial for accurate atmospheric retrievals if clouds are present in the atmosphere. When the planetary mass is known within 10\% uncertainty, our retrievals successfully identified the background atmospheric gas and accurately constrained atmospheric parameters together with clouds. However, with less constrained or unknown planetary mass, we observed significant biases, particularly in the misidentification of the dominant atmospheric gas. For instance, the dominant gas was incorrectly identified as oxygen for a modern-Earth-like planet or carbon dioxide for an Archean-Earth-like planet, potentially leading to erroneous assessments of planetary habitability and biosignatures. These biases arise because, the uncertainties in planetary mass affect the determination of surface gravity and atmospheric scale height, leading the retrieval algorithm to compensate by adjusting the atmospheric composition. Our findings emphasize the importance of achieving precise mass measurements-ideally within 10\% uncertainty-through methods such as extreme precision radial velocity or astrometry, especially for future missions like the Habitable Worlds Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of dark matter, which constitutes 27% of the Universe's matter-energy content, remains one of the most challenging open questions in physics. Over the past two decades, the DAMA/LIBRA experiment has reported an annual modulation in the detection rate of $\approx$250 kg of NaI(Tl) detectors operated at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, which the collaboration interprets as evidence of the galactic dark matter detection. However, this claim has not been independently confirmed and is refuted under certain dark matter particle and halo model scenarios. Therefore, it is crucial to perform an experiment with the same target material. The ANAIS experiment uses 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl) detectors at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory and it has been collecting data since August 2017 to model-independently test the DAMA/LIBRA result. This article presents the results of the annual modulation analysis corresponding to six years of ANAIS-112 data. Our results, the most sensitive to date with the same target material, NaI(Tl), are incompatible with the DAMA/LIBRA modulation signal at a 4$\sigma$ confidence level. Such a discrepancy strongly challenges the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter interpretation and highlights the need to address systematic uncertainties affecting the comparison, particularly those related to the response of detectors to nuclear recoils, which may require further characterization of the DAMA crystals.

 - **Abstract**
 V498 Hya (SDSS J084555.07+033929.2) was identified as a short-period cataclysmic variable (CV) by the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS) in 2008. The superhump period was measured during the detected single superoutburst of V498 Hya. The quiescent spectrum subsequently taken by the \SDSSV\ Milky Way Mapper survey suggested that the CV donor may be a brown dwarf. We present time-resolved follow-up spectroscopy of V498 Hya in quiescence, obtained with the GTC OSIRIS spectrograph, from which we derived the 86.053 min spectroscopic period, systemic radial velocity, and the gravitational redshift of the Mg II line. We also modeled the spectral energy distribution to constrain the system parameters, including the > 0.82 Ms mass of the white dwarf and the best-fit value 0.043 +/- 0.004 Ms of the donor star mass. This combination of parameters implies that V498 Hya has evolved past the period minimum and is a relatively rare ``period bouncer''.

          From pre-transit to post-eclipse: investigating the impact of 3D temperature, chemistry, and dynamics on high-resolution emission spectra of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution spectroscopy has provided a wealth of information about the climate and composition of ultra-hot Jupiters. However, the 3D structure of their atmospheres makes observations more challenging to interpret, necessitating 3D forward-modeling studies. In this work, we model phase-dependent thermal emission spectra of the archetype ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b to understand how the line strengths and Doppler shifts of Fe, CO, H$_2$O, and OH evolve throughout the orbit. We post-process outputs of the SPARC/MITgcm global circulation model with the 3D Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code gCMCRT to simulate emission spectra at 36 orbital phases. We then cross-correlate the spectra with different templates to obtain CCF and $K_{\text{p}}$$-$$V_{\text{sys}}$ maps. For each species, our models produce consistently negative $K_{\text{p}}$ offsets in pre- and post-eclipse, which are driven by planet rotation. The size of these offsets is similar to the equatorial rotation velocity of the planet. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the weak vertical temperature gradient on the nightside of ultra-hot Jupiters mutes the absorption features of CO and H$_2$O, which significantly hampers their detectability in pre- and post-transit. We also show that the $K_{\text{p}}$ and $V_{\text{sys}}$ offsets in pre- and post-transit are not always a measure for the line-of-sight velocities in the atmosphere. This is because the cross-correlation signal is a blend of dayside emission and nightside absorption features. Finally, we highlight that the observational uncertainty in the known orbital velocity of ultra-hot Jupiters can be multiple km/s, which makes it hard for certain targets to meaningfully report absolute $K_{\text{p}}$ offsets.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that in realistic models where primordial black holes are formed due to the collapse of sizeable inflationary perturbations, their initial spatial clustering beyond Poisson distribution does not play any role in the binary mergers, including sub-solar primordial black holes, responsible for the gravitational waves detectable by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. This is a consequence of the existing FIRAS CMB distortion constraints on the relevant scales. This conclusion might not hold for lighter masses potentially accessible by future gravitational wave observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate that in the presence of a light scalar spectator field, vacuum transitions taking place during inflation can produce large, potentially detectable non-Gaussian signatures in the primordial curvature perturbation. Such transitions are common in theories with multiple scalar fields when the potential has several minima. Our computation proceeds by numerically finding the instanton solution that describes quantum tunnelling between vacuum states in a de Sitter background, calculating its dependence on the spectator field and, thereby, its effect on the expansion of space. For a scenario with Higgs inflation, we obtain the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_\mathrm{NL} \sim O(10)$ and study its parameter dependence.
