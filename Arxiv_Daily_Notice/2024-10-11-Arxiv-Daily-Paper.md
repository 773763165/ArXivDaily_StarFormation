          Fundamental constants: from measurement to the universe, a window on gravitation and cosmology

 - **Abstract**
 Fundamental constants are a cornerstone of the physical laws. Any constant varying in space and/or time would signal a violation of local position invariance and be associated with a violation of the universality of free fall, and hence of the weak equivalence principle. It will reflect the existence of new degrees of freedom that couple to standard matter. Thus, testing for the stability of fundamental constants is of utmost importance for our understanding of gravity and for characterizing the domain of validity of General Relativity. Besides, it opens an independent window on dark matter and dark energy. As a consequence, thanks to the active development of experiments and of their accuracy, fundamental constants have become a key player in our search for physics beyond the standard model of and beyond General Relativity. This review details the roles of the fundamental constants in the laws of physics and in the construction of the International System of units. Then, the relations between constants, tests of the local position invariance and of the universality of free fall are exposed, as well as the construction of field theories that account for "varying constants". Then, the main experimental and observational constraints are described. It details the basics of each system, its dependence with respect to the primary parameters the variation of which can be constrained from observations, the known systematics effects and the most recent constraints. It also describes how these primary parameters can be related to the fundamental constants and the model-dependencies. Both time and space variation are considered. Given the huge increase of data and constraints, a general scheme to present experimental and observational results and to construct a collaborative data base that will be more efficient for the community and allow for better traceability, is proposed.

          Impact of Exoplanet Science on Society: Professional Contributions, Citizen Science Engagement and Public Perception

 - **Abstract**
 The impact of exoplanet science on both the scientific community and on the general public is presented through various indicators and examples. It is estimated that about 3-4% of all refereed astronomy articles focus on exoplanets, and between 15-20% percent of current, and up to 25% of upcoming astronomy space missions are dedicated to exoplanet research. Also, about 15-20% of the science cases for large multi-purpose ground-based astronomical instruments involve exoplanet science. Interactions between the scientific community and the public occur on several levels and play a crucial role in shaping the future of exoplanet science. The rise of citizen science platforms and the successes of coordinated observing projects involving amateur astronomers have engaged the public in meaningful scientific contributions, and contribute to some areas of discovery and characterization of exoplanet systems, for which several examples are given. These initiatives not only fuel public interest in the search for extraterrestrial life but also promote STEM education, broadening participation in science. Lastly, the changing perception of the informed public about the existence of "other Earths" and life in the Universe in the light of results from exoplanet science is outlined. Media coverage of results from exoplanet science has furthered the acceptance that extraterrestrial life, be it intelligent of not, is not rare in the Universe. The shift in perception that such life might be detected in a potentially not very distant future has, in turn, promoted public support for the research infrastructure necessary to sustain the growth of exoplanetology.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectral classification is the division of stars into classes based on their spectral characteristics. Different classification systems have existed since the 19th century but the term is used nowadays mostly to refer to the Morgan-Keenan (MK) system, which was established in the 1940s and has been developed since then. The MK classification has three components: a spectral type, a luminosity class, and (possibly) suffixes or qualifiers. The first two components represent temperature and luminosity sequences (a 2-D grid), respectively, and the third one includes additional information. The MK system is an Aristotelian morphological classification system that uses the MK process, an inductive approach based on specimens (standard stars) that define the system. In that respect, it is different from and a required preliminary step for quantitative spectroscopy, whose goal is to extract the physical properties and chemical composition of the stars. In this entry we provide a brief history of spectral classification, describe the general properties of the classification criteria of the MK system, analyze the specific spectral type and luminosity class criteria used for each spectral class, and introduce the different peculiar types that can be found within the 2-D classification grid and at its edges.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are unique probes of extragalactic ionized baryonic structure as each signal, through its burst properties, holds information about the ionized matter it encounters along its sightline. FRB 20200723B is a burst with a scattering timescale of $\tau_\mathrm{400\,MHz} >$1 second at 400 MHz and a dispersion measure of DM $\sim$ 244 pc cm$^{-3}$. Observed across the entire CHIME/FRB frequency band, it is the single-component burst with the largest scattering timescale yet observed by CHIME/FRB. The combination of its high scattering timescale and relatively low dispersion measure present an uncommon opportunity to use FRB 20200723B to explore the properties of the cosmic web it traversed. With an $\sim$arcminute-scale localization region, we find the most likely host galaxy is NGC 4602 (with PATH probability $P(O|x)=0.985$), which resides $\sim$30 Mpc away within a sheet filamentary structure on the outskirts of the Virgo Cluster. We place an upper limit on the average free electron density of this filamentary structure of $\langle n_e \rangle < 4.6^{+9.6}_{-2.0} \times 10^{-5}$ cm$^{-3}$, broadly consistent with expectations from cosmological simulations. We investigate whether the source of scattering lies within the same galaxy as the FRB, or at a farther distance from an intervening structure along the line of sight. Comparing with Milky Way pulsar observations, we suggest the scattering may originate from within the host galaxy of FRB 20200723B.

          Considerations for Photochemical Modeling of Possible Hycean Worlds

 - **Abstract**
 JWST is revolutionising the study of temperate sub-Neptunes, starting with the first detection of carbon-bearing molecules in the habitable-zone sub-Neptune K2-18 b. The retrieved abundances of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ and non-detection of NH$_3$ and CO in K2-18 b are consistent with prior predictions of photochemical models for a Hycean world with a habitable ocean. However, recent photochemical modeling raised the prospect that the observed abundances may be explained by a mini-Neptune scenario instead. In this study, we explore these scenarios using independent photochemical modeling with K2-18 b as a case study. We find the previous results to be sensitive to a range of model assumptions, such as the photochemical cross sections, incident stellar spectrum, surface pressure, UV albedo, and metallicity, significantly affecting the resulting abundances. We explore a wide model space to investigate scenarios that are compatible with the retrieved molecular abundances for K2-18 b. Our analysis shows that the previously favoured mini-Neptune scenario is not compatible with most of the retrieved abundances, while the Hycean scenarios, both inhabited and uninhabited, provide better agreement. An uninhabited Hycean scenario explains most of the abundance constraints, except CH$_4$ which is generally underabundant but dependent on the model assumptions. The inhabited Hycean scenario is compatible with all the abundances if the observed CH$_4$ is assumed to be predominantly biogenic. Our results underscore the importance of systematic photochemical modeling and accurate interpretation of chemical abundance constraints for candidate Hycean worlds.

          The effect of mass loss in models of red supergiants in the Small Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 The rate and mechanism of mass loss of red supergiants (RSGs) remain poorly understood, especially at low metallicities. Motivated by the new empirical prescription by Yang et al. 2023, based on the largest and most complete sample in the Small Magellanic Cloud, we investigate the impact of different popular and recent RSG mass-loss prescriptions that span a range of RSG mass-loss rates on the evolution and observable properties of single massive stars. Our results show that higher mass-loss rates result in earlier envelope stripping and shorter RSG lifetimes, particularly for the more luminous stars, leading to a steeper luminosity function and predicting hotter final positions for the SN progenitors. None of the considered mass-loss prescriptions is fully consistent with all observational constraints, highlighting ongoing uncertainties in deriving and modeling RSGs mass loss. The mass-loss rates suggested by Kee et al. predict rapid envelope stripping, inconsistent with the observed population of luminous RSGs and SN progenitor detections, while the models implementing the commonly used de Jager et al. and the recent Beasor et al. prescriptions overestimate the number of luminous RSGs. While the increased mass-loss rates for luminous RSGs predicted by Yang et al. lead to better agreement with the observed RSG luminosity function, naturally reproducing the updated Humphreys-Davidson limit, they also produce luminous yellow supergiant progenitors not detected in nearby supernovae. We also estimate that binary interactions tend to slightly increase the formation of luminous RSGs due to mass accretion or merging. Our study examines the impact of RSG mass loss during the late stages of massive stars, highlighting the significance of using comprehensive observational data, exploring the uncertainties involved, and considering the effects of binary-induced or episodic mass loss.

          Psi-GAN: A power-spectrum-informed generative adversarial network for the emulation of large-scale structure maps across cosmologies and redshifts

 - **Abstract**
 Simulations of the dark matter distribution throughout the Universe are essential in order to analyse data from cosmological surveys. $N$-body simulations are computationally expensive, and many cheaper alternatives (such as lognormal random fields) fail to reproduce accurate statistics of the smaller, non-linear scales. In this work, we present Psi-GAN (Power-spectrum-informed Generative Adversarial Network), a machine learning model which takes a two-dimensional lognormal dark matter density field and transforms it into a more realistic field. We construct Psi-GAN so that it is continuously conditional, and can therefore generate realistic realisations of the dark matter density field across a range of cosmologies and redshifts of $z \in [0, 3]$. We train Psi-GAN as a generative adversarial network on $2\,000$ simulation boxes from the Quijote simulations. We use a novel critic architecture that utilises the power spectrum as the basis for discrimination between real and generated samples. Psi-GAN shows agreement with $N$-body simulations over a range of redshifts and cosmologies, consistently outperforming the lognormal approximation on all tests of non-linear structure, such as being able to reproduce both the power spectrum up to wavenumbers of $1~h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and the bispectra of target $N$-body simulations to within ${\sim}5$ per cent. Our improved ability to model non-linear structure should allow tighter constraints on cosmological parameters when used in techniques such as simulation-based inference.

          Optimal Attitude Control of Large Flexible Space Structures with Distributed Momentum Actuators

 - **Abstract**
 Recent spacecraft mission concepts propose larger payloads that have lighter, less rigid structures. For large lightweight structures, the natural frequencies of their vibration modes may fall within the attitude controller bandwidth, threatening the stability and settling time of the controller and compromising performance. This work tackles this issue by proposing an attitude control design paradigm of distributing momentum actuators throughout the structure to have more control authority over vibration modes. The issue of jitter disturbances introduced by these actuators is addressed by expanding the bandwidth of the attitude controller to suppress excess vibrations. Numerical simulation results show that, at the expense of more control action, a distributed configuration can achieve lower settling times and reduce structural deformation compared to a more standard centralized configuration.

          Global signal in the redshifted hydrogen 21-cm line from Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn: dependences on dark matter nature and first light

 - **Abstract**
 We estimate the global signal in the redshifted hyperfine structure line 21 cm of hydrogen atoms formed during the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn epochs. The evolution of the brightness temperature in this line was computed to study its dependence on the physical conditions in the intergalactic medium. We show that the profile of this line crucially depends on the temperature and ionization of baryonic matter as well as the spectral energy distribution of radiation from the first sources. The cosmological models with the self-annihilating and decaying dark matter with allowable parameters by current observational data, as well as the model of the first light which is consistent with the observational data on reionization were considered. The results show that the Dark Ages part of profile is very sensitive to the parameters of self-annihilating and decaying dark matter particles, while the Cosmic Dawn part of profile is very sensitive also to the spectral energy distribution of radiation from the first sources. It was concluded that only compatible observations of the redshifted 21 cm line in the decameter and meter wavelength range, formed during the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn, will make it possible to constrain the parameters of dark matter models and astrophysical models of the first sources based on the radiotomography of the young Universe.

          Intense star cluster formation: stellar masses, the mass function, and the fundamental mass scale

 - **Abstract**
 Within the birth environment of a massive globular cluster, the combination of a luminous young stellar population and a high column density induces a state in which the thermal optical depth and radiation pressure are both appreciable. In this state, the sonic mass scale, which influences the peak of the stellar mass function, is tied to a fundamental scale composed of the Planck mass and the mass per particle. Thermal feedback also affects the opacity-limited minimum mass and affects how protostellar outflows and binary fragmentation modify stellar masses. Considering the regions that collapse to form massive stars, we argue that thermal stabilization is likely to flatten the high-mass slope of the initial mass function. Among regions that are optically thick to thermal radiation, we expect the stellar population to become increasingly top-heavy at higher column densities, although this effect can be offset by lowering the metallicity. A toy model is presented that demonstrates these effects, and in which radiation pressure leads to gas dispersal before all of the mass is converted into stars.

          Striking a Chord with Spectral Sirens: multiple features in the compact binary population correlate with $H_0$

 - **Abstract**
 Spectral siren measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) rely on correlations between observed detector-frame masses and luminosity distances. Features in the source-frame mass distribution can induce these correlations. It is crucial, then, to understand (i) which features in the source-frame mass distribution are robust against model (re)parametrization, (ii) which features carry the most information about $H_0$, and (iii) whether distinct features independently correlate with cosmological parameters. We study these questions using real gravitational-wave observations from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations' third observing run. Although constraints on $H_0$ are weak, we find that current data reveals several prominent features in the mass distribution, including peaks in the binary black hole source-frame mass distribution near $\sim$ 9 $\rm{M}_{\odot}$ and $\sim$ 32$\rm{M}_{\odot}$ and a roll-off at masses above $\sim$ 46$\rm{M}_{\odot}$. For the first time using real data, we show that all of these features carry cosmological information and that the peak near $\sim$ 32$\rm{M}_{\odot}$ consistently correlates with $H_0$ most strongly. Introducing model-independent summary statistics, we show that these statistics independently correlate with $H_0$, exactly what is required to limit systematics within future spectral siren measurements from the (expected) astrophysical evolution of the mass distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 The first very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) detections at 870$\mu$m wavelength (345$\,$GHz frequency) are reported, achieving the highest diffraction-limited angular resolution yet obtained from the surface of the Earth, and the highest-frequency example of the VLBI technique to date. These include strong detections for multiple sources observed on inter-continental baselines between telescopes in Chile, Hawaii, and Spain, obtained during observations in October 2018. The longest-baseline detections approach 11$\,$G$\lambda$ corresponding to an angular resolution, or fringe spacing, of 19$\mu$as. The Allan deviation of the visibility phase at 870$\mu$m is comparable to that at 1.3$\,$mm on the relevant integration time scales between 2 and 100$\,$s. The detections confirm that the sensitivity and signal chain stability of stations in the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) array are suitable for VLBI observations at 870$\mu$m. Operation at this short wavelength, combined with anticipated enhancements of the EHT, will lead to a unique high angular resolution instrument for black hole studies, capable of resolving the event horizons of supermassive black holes in both space and time.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies point out that quantum effects, referred to as "memory burden", may slow down the evaporation of black holes. As a result, a population of light primordial black holes could potentially survive to the present day, thus contributing to the energy density of dark matter. In this work, we focus on light primordial black holes with masses $M_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{9}~{\rm g}$ that, due to the memory burden effect, are currently evaporating, emitting high-energy particles, among which neutrinos, in the local Universe. Analyzing the latest IceCube data, we place novel constraints on the combined parameter space of primordial black holes and the memory burden effect. We also study the projected reach of future neutrino telescopes such as IceCube-Gen2 and GRAND. We find that the neutrino observations are crucial to probe scenarios with highly-suppressed evaporation and light masses for primordial black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Neural network (NN) emulators of the global 21 cm signal need emulation error much less than the observational noise in order to be used to perform unbiased Bayesian parameter inference. To this end, we introduce $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ -- a long short-term memory (LSTM) NN emulator of the global 21 cm signal that leverages the intrinsic correlation between frequency channels to achieve exceptional accuracy compared to previous emulators, which are all feedforward, fully connected NNs. LSTM NNs are a type of recurrent NN designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. When trained and tested on the same simulated set of global 21 cm signals as the best previous emulators, $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ has average relative rms error of 0.22% -- equivalently 0.39 mK -- and comparably fast evaluation time. We perform seven-dimensional Bayesian parameter estimation analyses using $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ to fit global 21 cm signal mock data with different adopted observational noise levels, $\sigma_{21}$. The posterior $1\sigma$ rms error is $\approx3\times$ less than $\sigma_{21}$ for each fit and consistently decreases for tighter noise levels, showing that $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ can sufficiently exploit even very optimistic measurements of the global 21 cm signal. We made the emulator, code, and data sets publicly available so that $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ can be independently tested and used to retrain and constrain other 21 cm models.

 - **Abstract**
 The LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) has successfully measured cosmic rays for over a decade now. With its dense core of antenna fields in the Netherlands, it is an ideal tool for studying the radio emission from extensive air showers in the $10^{16}$ eV to $10^{18.5}$ eV range. Every air shower is measured with a small particle detector array and hundreds of antennas, which sets LOFAR apart from other air shower arrays. We present our current achievements and progress in reconstruction, interpolation, and software development during the final phases of measurement of LOFAR 1.0, before the LOFAR array gets a significant upgrade, including also plans for the final data release and refined analyses.

          Unified Origin of Curvature Perturbation and Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a unified framework that describes both the curvaton mechanism for generating primordial density fluctuations and the Affleck-Dine (AD) field for baryogenesis. By introducing a complex scalar field (AD field) carrying a baryon/lepton number and its potential consisting of quadratic and quartic terms with a small baryon/lepton-number-violating mass term, we investigate the evolution of the scalar field during the radiation-dominated era following inflation. We set the initial conditions such that the quartic term dominates the scalar potential, and the angular component of the AD field is non-zero. We focus on a scenario where the AD field decays early, ensuring that its energy density never dominates over that of radiation. We show that the radial component of the AD field can be identified with the curvaton to solely produce the Planck normalized scalar power spectrum while the evolution of the angular component is crucial for generating the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe. Additionally, we find that the amplitude of scalar bispectrum $f_{NL}$ is positive, with an amplitude of $\mathcal{O}(1)$, which is consistent with the current Planck data and testable in future observations such as CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, LSS, and 21-cm experiments. In our estimation of the scalar power spectrum and bispectrum, we develop a novel analytical scheme for computing scalar fluctuations based on the $\delta N$ formalism, which allows us to deal with the evolution of curvaton with polynomial potential more accurately in comparison to the existing analytical methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the formation of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) in interstellar ices is key to constrain the sulfur chemistry in the interstellar medium (ISM), since it is the only ice S-bearing molecule securely detected thus far. Two general pathways for OCS formation have been proposed: sulfurization of CO (CO+S) and oxidation of CS (CS+O), but their relative contribution in interstellar ices remains unconstrained. We have evaluated the contribution of both pathways to OCS formation upon energetic processing in isotopically-labeled CO2:CS2 and CO:CS2 ice samples at 7-50 K. Our results indicated that formation of OCS through the CS+O pathway was more favorable than through the CO+S pathway, as previously suggested by theoretical calculations. In addition, its relative contribution increased at higher temperatures. Therefore, this pathway could play a role in the ice formation of OCS, especially in warm regions where CO is expected to be preferentially in the gas phase. At the same time, we have explored the chemistry of CS2-bearing, CO2-, CO-, and also H2O-rich ices, that could be relevant to the sulfur interstellar chemistry. We observed formation of a variety of S-bearing products in addition to OCS, including SO2, C3S2, and S2. However, a significant fraction of sulfur was not detected at the end of the experiments, and could be locked in long, undetectable sulfur allotropes, one of the potential carriers of the missing sulfur in the dense ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Sensitivity and resolution of space telescopes are directly related to the size of the primary mirror. Enabling such future extremely large space telescopes or even arrays of those will require to drastically reduce the areal weight of the mirror system. Utilizing a thin parabolic polymeric membrane as primary mirror offers the prospect of very low weight and the flexible nature of those membranes allows compactly store them upon launch. Upon deployment the structure is unfolded and the mirror shape restored. Being an extremely thin structure, an active shape correction is required. Utilizing a thermal control of the surface via radiative coupling, localized shape changes are imprinted into the membrane telescope. In this paper we present the modelling and experimental test of the radiative adaptive optics. A detailed modeling of the influence function of the radiative shaping onto the membrane mirror has been carried out. Experimentally we have been radiatively actuated the shape of a prototype mirror in closed loop with a wavefront sensor and proven that we can control the mirrors surface figure to a ~15nm RMS precision.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown Dwarfs (BDs) are crucial objects in our understanding of both star and planet formation. However, there is still an unconcluded debate about which is the dominant formation mechanism of these objects. For this, it is mandatory to study BDs in their earliest evolutionary stages (what we call pre- and proto-BDs), comparable to the `pre-stellar' and `Class 0/I' stages well characterized for the formation of low-mass stars. In this review, the recent efforts aimed at searching, identifying and characterising pre- and proto-BD candidates in nearby star-forming regions are presented, and revised requirements for an object to be a promising proto-BD or pre-BD candidate are provided, based on a new, unexplored so far, relation between the internal luminosity and the accreted mass. By applying these requirements, a list of 67 promising proto-BD candidates is presented, along with a compilation of possible pre-BDs from the literature. Updated correlations of protostellar properties such as mass infall rate or outflow momentum rate with bolometric luminosity are provided down to the low-mass BD regime, where no significant deviations are apparent. Furthermore, the number of proto-BD candidates in different clouds of the Solar Neighborhood seem to follow the known relations of number of protostars with cloud properties. In addition, proto(star-to-BD) ratios for the different clouds are also explored, unveiling a particular underproduction of low-mass proto-BD candidates in Ophiuchus compared to Lupus and Taurus. Possible explanations for this behavior are discussed, including heating of the Ophiuchus cloud by the nearby OB stars. The overall results of this work tend to favor a star-like process for BD formation down to the planetary boundary, of about 10 Mjup, below which other mechanisms might be at work.

          Searching for the mHz variability in the TESS observations of nova-like cataclysmic variables

 - **Abstract**
 AIMS: We investigated fast optical variability of selected nova-like cataclysmic variables observed by TESS satellite. We searched for break frequencies (f_b) in the corresponding power density spectra (PDS). The goal is to study whether these systems in almost permanent high optical state exhibit preferred f_b around 1 mHz. METHODS: We selected non-interrupted light curve portions with duration of 5 and 10 days. We divided these portions into ten equally long light curve subsamples and calculated mean PDS. We searched for f_b in frequency interval from log(f/Hz) = -3.5 to -2.4. We defined as positive detection when the f_b was present in at least 50% of the light curve portions with a predefined minimum number of detections. RESULTS: We measured f_b in 15 nova-like systems and confirmed that the value of this frequency is clustered around 1 mHz with a maximum of the distribution between log(f/Hz) = -2.95 and -2.84. The confidence that this maximum is not a random feature of a uniform distribution is at least 96%. This is considerably improved since previous value of 69%. We discuss the origin of these f_b in the context of sandwich model where central hot X-ray corona surrounds central optically thick disc. This scenario could be supported by correlation between white dwarf mass and f_b; the larger the mass, the lower the frequency. We see such tendency in the measured data, however the data are too scattered and based on low number of measurements. Finally, it appears that systems with detected f_b have lower inclination than 60-75 degrees. In higher inclination binaries the central disc is not seen and the PDS is dominated by red noise. This also supports the inner disc regions as source of the observed f_b.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The interest in blazars as candidate neutrino emitters grew after the 3{\sigma} evidence for a joint photon-neutrino emission from the flaring blazar TXS 0506+056 in 2017. Blazars are a class of extragalactic sources with relativistic jets pointing toward Earth, showing a broadband emission explained in terms of leptonic and hadronic process, with the latter relevant for proton acceleration and neutrino production. Several models have been developed to explain the multi-messenger emission from TXS 0506+056, but the details of the neutrino production and the nature of the source are not yet fully understood. Aims. In this work we investigate sources with observational features as TXS 0506+056, aiming at a better understanding of their nature as flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) or BL Lac Objects (BL Lacs) and their potential neutrino production. Methods. We select candidate neutrino-emitting blazars from the Fermi 4LAC-DR2 catalog by constraining a number of key parameters in specific ranges centered on the values measured for TXS 0506+056. We analyze the efficiency of the accretion mechanism and model their broadband spectral energy distribution in terms of lepto-hadronic emission, gaining information on their potential neutrino flux and detectability prospects at TeV energies. Results. Our study shows the selected sources to have a high energy emission dominated by leptonic processes, and part of them also shows a high accretion rate, features typical of FSRQs. Moreover, the very high energy and neutrino fluxes appear to be not detectable by the current and future instruments if the source is in an average emission state. Our results thus suggest some of the candidates to have an efficient accretion and could potentially be masquerading BL Lacs. Lastly, TXS 0506+056 seems to have a more uncertain situation for which no strong conclusions can be drawn on its nature.

 - **Abstract**
 The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) is located at Haizi Mountain, Daocheng, Sichuan province, China. Due to its high-altitude location with frequent thunderstorm activities, the LHAASO is suited for studying the effects of near-earth thunderstorm electric fields on cosmic ray air showers. In this paper, Monte Carlo simulations are performed with CORSIKA and G4KM2A to analyze the flux variations of cosmic ray air showers detected by the kilometer-square array of LHAASO (LHAASO-KM2A) during thunderstorms. The strength, polarity, and layer thickness of atmospheric electric field (AEF) during thunderstorm are found to be associated with the shower rate variations. The flux of shower events satisfying trigger conditions of the KM2A increases with field intensity, particularly within negative fields, and the enhanced amplitude is more than 5% in -600 V/cm and 12% in -1000 V/cm, whereas it increases by only 1% and 7% in equivalent positive fields, respectively. While in positive fields ranging from 0 to 400 V/cm, the shower rate decreases with smaller amplitudes. Furthermore, the shower rate increases dramatically with the AEF layer thickness until a certain value, above which the variation trend slows down. The dependence of the trigger rate variation on the primary zenith angle has also been revealed, increasing in lower zenith angle ranges and showing opposite behaviors in higher ones. Additionally, we study that the relationship between the trigger rate variations and the primary energies, and find the enhanced amplitude of the shower rate decreases with increasing primary energy. Simultaneously, the shower events with lower primary energy show a significant increase, whereas events with higher primary energy are hardly affected during thunderstorms. Our simulations offer insights into the variation of the trigger rate detected by LHAASO-KM2A during thunderstorms.

 - **Abstract**
 The observations from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), led by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), have provided opportunities to constrain primordial gravitational waves at low frequencies. In this paper, we analyze the best-fit parameter values for different Gauss-Bonnet Inflationary Gravitational Wave (GB-IGW) models with the PTArcade program, and we compare the results with the observations of NANOGrav, European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA), Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), and International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). We find the potential parameter $n$ derived from the GB-IGW model is not necessarily positive. Instead, PTA data suggest the possibility of new parameter ranges. Meanwhile, the other parameters' results also have difference with traditional Cosmic Microwave Background analyses, shows the reason of different GW power spectra expected. Additionally, the GB-IGW models we calculated are closer to the central values of multiple PTA datasets compared to the standard inflation model, making the GB-IGW model more likely to be detected by future space-based gravitational wave observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 We present constraints on the shape of Kepler-51d, which is a super-puff with a mass $\sim6\,M_\oplus$ and a radius $\sim9\,R_\oplus$, based on detailed modeling of the transit light curve from JWST NIRSpec. The projected shape of this extremely low-density planet is consistent with being spherical, and a projected oblateness $f_\perp>0.2$ can be excluded regardless of the spin obliquity angles. If this is taken as the limit on the true shape of the planet, Kepler-51d is rotating at $\lesssim 50\%$ of its break-up spin rate, or its rotation period is $\gtrsim 33\,$hr. In the more plausible situation that the planetary spin is aligned with its orbital direction to within $30^\circ$, then its oblateness is $<0.08$, which corresponds to a dimensionless spin rate $\lesssim30\%$ of the break-up rotation and a dimensional rotation period $\gtrsim 53\,$hr. This seems to contradict the theoretical expectation that planets with such low masses may be spinning near break-up. We point out the usefulness of the stellar mean density and the orbital eccentricity in constraining the shape of the transiting planet, so planets with well-characterized host and orbital parameters are preferred in the detection of planetary oblateness with the JWST transit method.

 - **Abstract**
 The Zadko Observatory located approximately 70 kilometres north of Perth in the Yeal nature reserve within the Shire of Gingin, Western Australia, initially housed the 1.0 metre f/4 fast-slew Zadko Telescope which was commissioned in June 2008. Since the Zadko telescope has been in operation it has proven its worth by detecting numerous Gamma Ray Burst afterglows, two of these being the most distant 'optical transients' imaged by an Australian telescope. The Zadko telescope also contributed to the discovery of colliding neutron stars in 2017 capturing the imagination of the public. Another important use for the Zadko Telescope is the tracking and mapping of Space Debris which consist of all man-made objects, including their fragments or parts, other than active space vehicles larger than 10 microns and orbiting the Earth in outer space. The Zadko telescope forms part of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Gravitational Wave Discovery (OzGrav). With a view to supporting ongoing scientific instrument upgrades and observatory maintenance it has proven critical to attract additional funding and seek out collaboration with international partners. In this article, we will focus on the administrative and technical details of the Observatory, focusing on the sustainability of the Observatory and its ongoing potential for future growth into an internationally recognized Space Surveillance Hub. We will review the evolution of the Observatory, from its early, single instrument state, to its current multi-telescope and multi-instrument capabilities. We will finish by outlining the future of the Observatory and surrounds.

 We present the site quality of the Zadko Observatory, focusing on the brightness of the sky and the effects of the weather on the efficiency of the Observatory. We discuss these effects and their consequences for the scientific goals of the Observatory. Without surprise, the overall sky quality had decreased during the last decade. However, this decrease is mostly due to the weather pattern at the Observatory rather than the light pollution. We put an emphasis on how important the preservation of the sky darkness is for small observatories, in order to stabilize the global degradation of the site quality, as this directly impacts the scientific return of the observations.

 In the last 15 years, since the discovery of the first low-mass planets beyond the solar system, there has been tremendous progress in understanding the diversity of (super-)Earth and sub-Neptune exoplanets. Especially the influence of the planetary interior on the surface evolution (including the atmosphere) of exoplanets has been studied in detail. The first studies focused on the characterization of planets, including their potential interior structure, using as key observables only mass and radius. Meanwhile, a new field of geosciences of exoplanets has emerged, linking the planet to its stellar environment, and by coupling interior chemistry and dynamics to surface regimes and atmospheric compositions. The new era of atmospheric characterization by JWST as well as the ELT will allow testing of these theoretical predictions of atmospheric diversity based on interior structure, evolution, and outgassing models.

 - **Abstract**
 Meteors are important phenomenon reflecting many properties of interplanetary dust particles. The study of their origin, mass distribution, and orbit evolution all require large data volume, which can only be obtained using large meteor networks. After meteor networks in Europe and America, we present our designs and upgrades of a proposing network in China. The new designs are mainly aimed for facilitating data gathering process. Each of the newly designed meteor stations now can support up to 4 cameras to cover the full sky. Newer version of meteor station software now works as an integral system, which can streamline the process of detecting, measuring and uploading meteors. We have built a meteor data platform to store, process and display the meteor data automatically. The software and data platform are designed to be easy to learn and use, so it can attract more people to join and operate meteor stations. Four stations are installed as the first phase of the network, and during the operation in 10 months, the network detected 8,683 orbits, and we find that half of the orbits can be related to established meteoroid streams. The statistical analysis of sporadic meteoroids shows a bimodal distribution of the velocities, which coincides with previous studies. The distribution of Tisserand parameters, $T_j$, shows the two peaks at $T_j=0$ and 3, indicating the different orbits of parent bodies (isotropic and ecliptic), which are divided by $T_j=2$. The falling trajectory of a meteorite was also predicted using observational data of the network. We are currently expanding the network, and in the future we will carry out detailed analysis of the key parameters of the distribution of the meteoroids.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a transmission spectrum of the misaligned hot Jupiter WASP-15b from 2.8--5.2 microns observed with JWST's NIRSpec/G395H grating. Our high signal to noise data, which has negligible red noise, reveals significant absorption by H$_2$O ($4.2\sigma$) and CO$_2$ ($8.9\sigma$). From independent data reduction and atmospheric retrieval approaches, we infer that WASP-15b's atmospheric metallicity is super-solar ($\gtrsim 15\times$ solar) and its C/O is consistent with solar, that together imply planetesimal accretion. Our GCM simulations for WASP-15b suggest that the C/O we measure at the limb is likely representative of the entire photosphere due to the mostly uniform spatial distribution of H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and CO. We additionally see evidence for absorption by SO$_2$ and absorption at 4.9$\mu$m, for which the current leading candidate is OCS, albeit with several caveats. If confirmed, this would be the first detection of OCS in an exoplanet atmosphere and point towards complex photochemistry of sulphur-bearing species in the upper atmosphere. These are the first observations from the BOWIE-ALIGN survey which is using JWST's NIRSpec/G395H instrument to compare the atmospheric compositions of aligned/low-obliquity and misaligned/high-obliquity hot Jupiters around F stars above the Kraft break. The goal of our survey is to determine whether the atmospheric composition differs across two populations of planets that have likely undergone different migration histories (disc versus disc-free) as evidenced by their obliquities (aligned versus misaligned).

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray emission is observed coincident in position to the evolved, composite supernova remnant (SNR) B0453-685. Prior multi-wavelength investigations of the region indicate that the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) within the SNR is the most likely origin for the observed gamma-rays, with a possible pulsar contribution that becomes significant at energies below E ~ 5GeV. Constraints on the PWN hard X-ray spectrum are important for the most accurate broadband representation of PWN emission and determining the presence of a gamma-ray pulsar component. The results of Parkes radio and NuSTAR X-ray observations are presented on PWN B0453-685. We perform a search for the central pulsar in the new Parkes radio data, finding an upper limit of 12uJy. A pulsation search in the new NuSTAR observation additionally provides a 3sigma upper-limit on the hard X-ray pulsed fraction of 56%. The PWN is best characterized with a photon index Gamma_X = 1.91 +\- 0.20 in the 3-78keV NuSTAR data and the results are incorporated into existing broadband models. Lastly, we characterize a serendipitous source detected by Chandra and NuSTAR that is considered a new high mass X-ray binary candidate.

 We present the first emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-17 b using one eclipse observation from the JWST Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) Single Object Slitless Spectroscopy (SOSS) mode. Covering a wavelength range of 0.6 to 2.8 microns, our retrieval analysis reveals a strong detection of H2O in WASP-17b dayside atmosphere (6.4sigma). Our retrievals consistently favor a super-solar dayside H2O abundance and a non-inverted temperature-pressure profile over a large pressure range. Additionally, our examination of the brightness temperature reveals excess emission below 1 microns, suggesting the possibility of a high internal temperature (600 to 700 K) and/or contributions from reflected light. We highlight that JWST emission spectroscopy retrieval results can be sensitive to whether negative eclipse depths are allowed at optical wavelengths during light curve fitting. Our findings deepen our understanding of WASP-17b atmospheric composition while also highlighting the sensitivity of our results to pressure-temperature profile parameterizations. This work is part of a series of studies by our JWST Telescope Scientist Team (JWST-TST), in which we will use Guaranteed Time Observations to perform Deep Reconnaissance of Exoplanet Atmospheres through Multi-instrument Spectroscopy (DREAMS).

 - **Abstract**
 We apply the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) to non-standard models of dark matter with suppressed small-scale structure imprinted by early-time physics, here exemplified by interacting dark matter (IDM) coupled to standard model neutrinos, and cross-check that the EFTofLSS has no trouble replicating the real-space halo-halo power spectrum from N-body simulations. We perform forecasts for a DESI ELG-like experiment using the redshift-space power spectrum and find that, under very conservative priors on these parameters, the EFTofLSS is not expected to yield strong constraints on dark matter interactions. However, with a better understanding of the evolution of counterterms and stochastic terms with redshift, realistic IDM models could in principle be detected using the full-shape power spectrum analysis of such a spectroscopic galaxy survey.

          The mystery of water in the atmosphere of $\tau$ Bo\"otis b continues: insights from revisiting archival CRIRES observations

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical abundances of gas-giant exoplanet atmospheres hold clues to the formation and evolution pathways that sculpt the exoplanet population. Recent ground-based high-resolution spectroscopic observations of the non-transiting hot Jupiter $\tau$ Boötis b from different instruments have resulted in a tension on the presence of water vapour in the planet's atmosphere, which impact the planet's inferred C/O and metallicity. To investigate this, we revisit the archival CRIRES observations of the planet's dayside in the wavelength range 2.28 to 2.33 $\mu$m. We reanalyse them using the latest methods for correcting stellar and telluric systematics, and free-chemistry Bayesian atmospheric retrieval. We find that a spurious detection of CH$_{4}$ can arise from inadequate telluric correction. We confirm the detection of CO and constrain its abundance to be near solar $\log_{10}(\mathrm{CO})$ = -3.44$^{+1.63}_{-0.85}$ VMR. We find a marginal evidence for H$_{2}$O with $\log_{10}(\mathrm{H_{2}O})$ = -5.13$^{+1.22}_{-6.37}$ VMR. This translates to super solar C/O (0.95$^{+0.06}_{-0.31}$), marginally sub-solar metallicity (-0.21 $^{+1.66}_{-0.87}$). Due to the relatively large uncertainty on H$_{2}$O abundance, we cannot confidently resolve the tension on the presence of H$_{2}$O and the super-solar atmospheric metallicity of $\tau$ Boötis b. We recommend further observations of $\tau$ Boötis b in the wavelength ranges simultaneously covering CO and $\mathrm{H_{2}O}$ to confirm the peculiar case of the planet's super-solar C/O and metallicity.

 - **Abstract**
 We present multi-epoch optical spectropolarimetric and imaging polarimetric observations of the nearby Type II supernova (SN) 2023ixf discovered in M101 at a distance of 6.85 Mpc. The first imaging polarimetric observations were taken +2.33 days (60085.08 MJD) after the explosion, while the last imaging polarimetric data points (+73.19 and +76.19 days) were acquired after the fall from the light curve plateau. At +2.33 days there is strong evidence of circumstellar material (CSM) interaction in the spectra and the light curve. A significant level of polarization $P_r = 0.88\pm 0.06 \% $ seen during this phase indicates that this CSM is aspherical. We find that the polarization evolves with time toward the interstellar polarization level ($0.35\%$) during the photospheric phase, which suggests that the recombination photosphere is spherically symmetric. There is a jump in polarization ($P_r =0.65 \pm 0.08 \% $) at +73.19 days when the light curve falls from the plateau. This is a phase where polarimetric data is sensitive to non-spherical inner ejecta or a decrease in optical depth into the single scattering regime. We also present spectropolarimetric data that reveal line (de)polarization during most of the observed epochs. In addition, at +14.50 days we see an "inverse P Cygn" profile in the H and He line polarization, which clearly indicates the presence of asymmetrically distributed material overlying the photosphere. The overall temporal evolution of polarization is typical for Type II SNe, but the high level of polarization during the rising phase has only been observed in SN 2023ixf.
