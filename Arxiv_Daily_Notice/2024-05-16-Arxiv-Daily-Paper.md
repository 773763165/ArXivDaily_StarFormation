          Plasma Effects on Resonant Phenomena

 - **Abstract**
 The effect of autoionizing resonances in atomic systems and processes is reviewed. Theoretical framework for treating resonances in the coupled channel approximation using the R-matrix method, as well as approximations related to plasma applications are described. The former entails large-scale atomic computations, and the latter is based on a new method for including collisional, Stark, thermal and other broadening mechanisms. We focus particularly on the problem of opacities calculations in high-energy-density (HED) plasmas such as stellar interiors and inertial confinement fusion devices. The treatment is generally relevant to radiative and collisional processes as the cross sections become energy-temperature-density dependent. While the computational difficulty increases considerably, the reaction rates are significantly affected. The related issue of the Boltzmann-Saha equation-of-state and its variants in local-thermodynamic-equilibrium (LTE) is also explored as the intermediary between atomic data on the one hand and plasma environments on the other.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern transient surveys now routinely discover flares resulting from tidal disruption events (TDEs) which occur when stars, typically $\sim0.5-2$ M$_{\odot}$, are ripped apart after passing too close to a supermassive black hole. We present three examples of a new class of extreme nuclear transients (ENTs) that we interpret as the tidal disruption of intermediate mass ($\sim3-10$ M$_{\odot}$) stars. Each is coincident with their host-galaxy nucleus and exhibits a smooth ($<10$% excess variability), luminous ($2-7\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$), and long-lived ($>150$ days) flare. ENTs are extremely rare ($\geq1\times10^{-3}$ Gpc$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$) compared to any other known class of transients. They are at least twice as energetic ($0.5-2.5\times 10^{53}$ erg) as any other known transient and these extreme energetics rule out stellar origins.

          The impact of radiative levitation on mode excitation of main-sequence B-type pulsators

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical computations of stellar oscillations for models representative of B-type stars predict fewer modes to be excited than observations reveal from modern space-based photometric data. One shortcoming of state-of-the-art evolution models of B-type stars that may cause a lack of excited modes is the absence of microscopic diffusion in most such models. We investigate whether the inclusion of microscopic diffusion in stellar models of B-type stars, notably radiative levitation experienced by isotopes, leads to extra mode driving by the opacity mechanism compared to the case of models that do not include microscopic diffusion. We consider the case of slowly to moderately rotating stars and use non-rotating equilibrium models, while we account for (uniform) rotation in the computations of the pulsation frequencies. We calculate 1D stellar models with and without microscopic diffusion and examine the effect of radiative levitation on mode excitation, for both low-radial order pressure and gravity modes and for high-radial order gravity modes. We find systematically more modes to be excited for the stellar models including microscopic diffusion compared to those without it, in agreement with observational findings of pulsating B-type dwarfs. Furthermore, the models with microscopic diffusion predict that excited modes occur earlier on in the evolution compared to modes without it. In order to maintain realistic surface abundances during the main sequence, we include macroscopic envelope mixing by internal gravity waves. While radiative levitation has so far largely been neglected in stellar evolution computations of B-type stars for computational convenience, it impacts mode excitation predictions for stellar models of such stars. We conclude that the process of radiative levitation is able to reduce the discrepancy between predicted and observed excited pulsation modes in B-type stars.

          The Scientific Impact of a Noiseless Energy-Resolving Detector for a Future Exoplanet-Imaging Mission

 - **Abstract**
 Future space missions that aim to detect and characterize Earth-like exoplanets will require an instrument that efficiently measures spectra of these planets, placing strict requirements on detector performance. The upcoming Roman Space Telescope will demonstrate the performance of an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) as part of the coronagraphic instrument (CGI). The recent LUVOIR and HabEx studies baselined pairing such a detector with an integral field spectrograph (IFS) to take spectra of multiple exoplanets and debris disks simultaneously. We investigate the scientific impact of a noiseless energy-resolving detector for the planned Habitable Worlds Observatory's (HWO) coronagraphic instrument. By assuming higher quantum efficiency, higher optical throughput, and zero noise, we effectively place upper limits on the impact of advancing detector technologies. We find that energy-resolving detectors would potentially take spectra of hundreds of additional exoplanets "for free" over the course of an HWO survey, greatly increasing its scientific yield.

          Damping wing absorption associated with a giant Ly$\alpha$ trough at $z < 6$: direct evidence for late-ending reionization

 - **Abstract**
 Multiple observations now suggest that the hydrogen reionization may have ended well below redshift six. While there has previously been no conclusive proof of extended neutral islands in the $z < 6$ intergalactic medium, it is possible that such islands give rise to the giant Ly$\alpha$ absorption troughs seen in the spectra of high-redshift quasars. Here we present evidence that the deepest and longest-known Ly$\alpha$ trough at $z < 6$, towards ULAS J0148+0600 (J0148), is associated with damping wing absorption. The evidence comes from a window of strong Ly$\alpha$ transmission at the edge of the J0148 proximity zone. We show that the relatively smooth profile of this transmission window is highly unlikely to arise from resonant absorption alone, but is consistent with the presence of a damping wing. We further argue that the damping wing is unlikely to arise from a compact source due to the lack of associated metal lines, and is more likely to arise from an extended neutral island associated with the giant Ly$\alpha$ trough. We investigate the physical conditions that may give rise to the strong transmission window, and speculate that it may signal an usually deep void, nearby ionizing sources, and/or the recent passage of an ionization front.

 - **Abstract**
 The Kepler mission reveals a peculiar trough-peak feature in the orbital spacing of close-in planets near mean-motion resonances: a deficit and an excess that are a couple percent to the narrow, respectively wide, of the resonances. This feature has received two main classes of explanations, one involving eccentricity damping, the other scattering with small bodies. Here, we point out a few issues with the damping scenario, and study the scattering scenario in more detail. We elucidate why scattering small bodies tends to repel two planets. As the small bodies random-walk in energy and angular momentum space, they tend to absorb, fractionally, more energy than angular momentum. This, which we call "ping-pong repulsion", transports angular momentum from the inner to the outer planet and pushes the two planets apart. Such a process, even if ubiquitous, leaves identifiable marks only near first-order resonances: diverging pairs jump across the resonance quickly and produce the MMR asymmetry. To explain the observed positions of the trough-peaks, a total scattering mass of order a few percent of the planet masses is required. Moreover, if this mass is dominated by a handful of Mercury-sized bodies, one can also explain the planet eccentricities as inferred from transit-time-variations. Lastly, we suggest how these conditions may have naturally arisen during the late stages of planet formation.

          Atmospheric muons and their variations with temperature

 - **Abstract**
 Seasonal variations of atmospheric muons are traditionally interpreted in terms of an effective temperature that relates the atmospheric temperature profile at a given time to the dependence of muon production on atmospheric depth. This paper aims to review and generalize the treatment of muon production and effective temperature that has been used to interpret seasonal variations of atmospheric muons by many experiments. The formalism is developed both in integral form -- for application to compact detectors at a fixed depth that record all muons with $E_\mu > E_\mu^\mathrm{min}$ -- and in differential form -- for application to extended detectors like IceCube, KM3NeT, and Baikal-GVD, where the rates are proportional to energy-dependent effective areas.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform the first multidimensional fluid simulations of thermonuclear helium ignition underneath a hydrogen-rich shell. This situation is relevant to Type I X-ray bursts on neutron stars which accrete from a hydrogen-rich companion. Using the low Mach number fluid code MAESTROeX, we investigate the growth of the convection zone due to nuclear burning, and the evolution of the chemical abundances in the atmosphere of the star. We also examine the convective boundary mixing processes which cause the evolution to differ significantly from previous one-dimensional simulations that rely on mixing-length theory. We find that the convection zone grows outwards as penetrating fluid elements cool the overlying radiative layer, rather than directly from the increasing entropy of the convection zone itself. Simultaneously, these flows efficiently mix composition, carrying carbon out of, and protons into the convection zone even before contact with the hydrogen shell. We discuss the implications of these effects for future modeling of these events and observations.

          Comparing bulge RR Lyrae stars with bulge giants -- Insight from 3D kinematics

 - **Abstract**
 The structure and kinematics of the old component of the Galactic bulge are still a matter of debate. The bulk of the bulge as traced by red clump stars includes two main components, which are usually identified as the metal-rich and metal-poor components. They have different shapes, kinematics, mean metallicities, and alpha-element abundances. It is our current understanding that they are associated with a bar and a spheroid, respectively. On the other hand, RR Lyrae variables trace the oldest population of the bulge. While it would be natural to think that they follow the structure and kinematics of the metal-poor component, the data analysed in the literature show conflicting results. We aim to derive a rotation curve for bulge RR Lyrae stars in order to determine that the old component traced by these stars is distinct from the two main components observed in the Galactic bulge. This paper combines APOGEE-2S spectra with OGLE-IV light curves, near-IR photometry, and proper motions from the VISTA Variables in the Ví a L\' actea survey for 4197 RR Lyrae stars. Six-dimensional phase-space coordinates were used to calculate orbits within an updated Galactic potential and to isolate the stars. The stars that stay confined within the bulge represent 57% of our sample. Our results show that bulge RR Lyrae variables rotate more slowly than metal-rich red clump stars and have a lower velocity dispersion. Their kinematics is compatible with them being the low-metallicity tail of the metal-poor component. We confirm that a rather large fraction of halo RR Lyrae stars pass by the bulge within their orbits, increasing the velocity dispersion. A proper orbital analysis is therefore critical to isolate bona fide bulge variables. Finally, bulge RR Lyrae seem to trace a spheroidal component, although the current data do now allow us to reach a firm conclusion about the spatial distribution.

          Puffy Venuses: the Mass-Radius Impact of Carbon-Rich Atmospheres on Lava Worlds

 - **Abstract**
 The recent advancements in exoplanet observations enable the potential detection of exo-Venuses, rocky planets with carbon-rich atmospheres. How extended these atmospheres can be, given high carbon abundances, has not been studied. To answer this, we present a model for a theoretical class of exoplanets - puffy Venuses - characterized by thick, carbon-dominated atmospheres in equilibrium with global magma oceans. Our model accounts for carbon and hydrogen partition between the atmosphere and the magma ocean, as well as the C-H-O equilibrium chemistry throughout a semi-grey, radiative-convective atmosphere. We find that radius inflation by puffy Venus atmospheres is significant on small and irradiated planets: carbon content of 1200 ppm (or that of ordinary chondrites) can generate an atmosphere of ~0.16 - 0.3 $R_{\oplus}$ for an Earth-mass planet with equilibrium temperatures of 1500 to 2000 K. We identify TOI-561 b as an especially promising puffy Venus candidate, whose under-density could be attributed to a thick C-rich atmosphere. We also advocate for a puffy Venus interpretation of 55 Cancri e, where recent JWST observation indicates the presence of a CO/CO2 atmosphere. Puffy Venuses may thus constitute a testable alternative interpretation for the interior structure of underdense low-mass exoplanets.

          A temperature or FUV tracer? The HNC/HCN ratio in M83 on the GMC scale

 - **Abstract**
 The HNC/HCN ratio is observationally known as a thermometer in Galactic interstellar molecular clouds. A recent study has alternatively suggested that the HNC/HCN ratio is affected by the ultraviolet (UV) field, not by the temperature. We aim to study this ratio on the scale of giant molecular clouds in the barred spiral galaxy M83 towards the southwestern bar end and the central region from ALMA observations, and if possible, distinguish the above scenarios. We compare the high (40-50 pc) resolution HNC/HCN ratios with the star formation rate from the 3-mm continuum intensity and the molecular mass inferred from the HCN intensities. Our results show that the HNC/HCN ratios do not vary with the star formation rates, star formation efficiencies, or column densities in the bar-end region. In the central region, the HNC/HCN ratios become higher with higher star formation rates, which tend to cause higher temperatures. This result is not consistent with the previously proposed scenario in which the HNC/HCN ratio decreases with increasing temperature. Spectral shapes suggest that this trend may be due to optically thick HCN and optically thin HNC. In addition, we compare the large-scale ($\sim 200$ pc) correlation between the dust temperature from the FIR ratio and the HNC/HCN ratio for the southwestern bar-end region. The HNC/HCN ratio is lower when the dust temperatures are higher. We suggest from the above results that the HNC/HCN ratio depends on the UV radiation field that affects the interstellar medium on the $\sim100\,$pc scale where the column densities are low.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave signals from core-collapse supernovae are one of the important observables for extracting the information of dense matter. To extract the properties of proto-neutron stars produced via core-collapse supernovae by asteroseismology, we perform a linear perturbation analysis using data obtained from two-dimensional numerical simulations. We employ 12 and 20 solar-mass progenitors and compare two different treatments of gravity. One is a general relativistic one with a conformal flatness condition and the other is an effective gravitational potential mimicking the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff solution. We discuss how the frequencies of the proto-neutron star oscillations corresponding to the gravitational wave signals in the simulations depend on the proto-neutron star properties. In our models, we find that the gravitational wave frequencies of the proto-neutron stars determined with the Cowling approximation can be expressed to very good approximation as a function of the proto-neutron star average density almost independently of the progenitor mass, treatment of gravity in the simulations, and the interpolations in the simulations. On the other hand, if one considers the gravitational wave frequencies as a function of the surface gravity of proto-neutron stars, such a relation appears sensitive to the treatment of gravity and other numerical details in the simulations. Thus, the average density of proto-neutron stars seems more suitable for universally expressing the supernova gravitational wave frequencies, instead of the surface gravity.

          The integrated perturbation theory for cosmological tensor fields IV: Full-sky formulation

 - **Abstract**
 In Papers I-III, we use the flat-sky and distant-observer approximations to develop a formalism with which the correlation statistics of cosmological tensor fields are calculated by the nonlinear perturbation theory, generalizing the integrated perturbation theory for scalar fields. In this work, the formalism is extended to include the full-sky and wide-angle effects in evaluating the power spectra and correlation functions of cosmological tensor fields of any ranks. With the newly developed formalism, one can evaluate the nonlinear power spectra and correlation functions to arbitrary higher orders in principle. After describing the general formalism, we explicitly derive and give analytic results of the lowest-order linear theory for an illustrative purpose in this paper. The derived linear formulas with full-sky and wide-angle effects are numerically compared with the previous formulas with flat-sky and distant-observer limits in a simple model of tensor bias.

 - **Abstract**
 Heating of charged particles via collisionless shocks, while ubiquitous in the universe, is an intriguing yet puzzling plasma phenomenon. One outstanding question is how electrons and ions approach an equilibrium after they were heated to different immediate-postshock temperatures. In order to fill the significant lack of observational information of the downstream temperature-relaxation process, we observe a thermal-dominant X-ray filament in the northwest of SN~1006 with Chandra. We divide this region into four layers with a thickness of 15$^{\prime\prime}$ or 0.16 pc each, and fit each spectrum by a non-equilibrium ionization collisional plasma model. The electron temperature was found to increase toward downstream from 0.52-0.62 keV to 0.82-0.95 keV on a length scale of 60 arcsec (or 0.64 pc). This electron temperature is lower than thermal relaxation processes via Coulomb scattering, requiring some other effects such as plasma mixture due to turbulence and/or projection effects, etc, which we hope will be resolved with future X-ray calorimeter missions such as XRISM and Athena.

          An ultra wide-band, high-sensitivity Q-band receiver for single-dish telescopes, eQ: rest frequency determination of CCS ($J_N$ = $4_3$-$3_2$) and SO ($J_N$ = $1_0$-$0_1$), and high-redshift CO ($J$ = 1-0) detection

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the development and commissioning of a new Q-band receiver for the Nobeyama 45-m telescope, covering 30--50 GHz with a receiver noise temperature of about 15 K. We name it eQ (extended Q-band) receiver. The system noise temperatures for observations are measured to be $\sim$ 30 K at 33 GHz and $\sim$ 75 K at 45 GHz. The Half-Power-Beam-Width (HPBW) is around 38\arcsec at 43 GHz. To enhance the observation capability, we tested the smoothed bandpass calibration technique and demonstrated the observation time can be significantly reduced compared to the standard position switch technique. The wide-bandwidth capability of this receiver provides precise determination of rest frequencies for molecular transitions with an accuracy of a few kHz through simultaneous observations of multiple transitions. Particularly, we determined the rest frequency of SO ($J_N$ = $1_0$--$0_1$) to be 30.001542 GHz, along with the rest frequency of CCS ($J_N$ = $4_3$--$3_2$) being 45.379033 GHz, adopting CCS ($J_N$ = $3_2$--$2_1$) at 33.751370 GHz as a reference line. The SO profile shows a double peak shape at the Cyanopolyyne Peak (CP) position of the Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 (TMC-1). The SO peaks coincide well with the CCS sub-components located near the outer parts of the TMC-1 filament. We interpret that the gravitational infall of TMC-1 generates shocks which enhance the SO abundance. The TMC-1 map shows that carbon-chain molecules are more abundant in the southern part of the filament, whereas SO is more abundant in the northern part. The eQ's excellent sensitivity allowed us to detect faint CO ($J$ = 1--0) spectra from the high-redshift object at a redshift of 2.442. Our receiver is expected to open new avenues for high-sensitivity molecular line observations in the Q-band.

          Characterizing NGC 6383: A study of pre-main sequence stars, mass segregation, and age using Gaia DR3 and 2MASS

 - **Abstract**
 This study employs Bayesian analysis and machine learning techniques to analyze the young open cluster NGC 6383 using data from Gaia DR3 and 2MASS. We identified 254 probable cluster members through HDBSCAN based on proper motions and determined the cluster's core and tidal radius. To perform this analysis, we utilized an extension of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, the No-U-Turn Sampler, using the Bayesian library PyMC. Our results indicate a mean cluster age of $4 \pm 1$ Myr and a distance of $1.107 \pm 0.035$ kpc. The analysis reveals mass segregation, especially among binary stars, and suggests that NGC 6383 is not fully relaxed. We observed a well-defined main sequence and a population of pre-main sequence stars, with a star formation range from $\sim 1$ to $6$ Myr, indicating recent star formation activity.

          Two models for the orbital modulation of $\gamma$-rays in Cyg X-3

 - **Abstract**
 We model the currently available $\gamma$-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope on Cyg X-3. Thanks to its very strong $\gamma$-ray activity during 2018--2021, the data quality has significantly improved. We study the strong orbital modulation of the $\gamma$-rays observed during at high $\gamma$-ray fluxes. The modulation, as found earlier, is well modeled by anisotropic Compton scattering of the donor blackbody emission by relativistic electrons in a jet strongly misaligned with respect to the orbital axis. We confirm that this model fits well both the average $\gamma$-ray modulation light curve and the spectrum. However, we find that if the jet is aligned with the spin axis of a rotating black hole, it would undergo geodetic precession with the period of $\sim$50 years. However, its presence is ruled out by both the $\gamma$-ray and radio data. Therefore, we consider an alternative model in which the average jet direction jet is aligned, but it is bent to outside the orbit owing to the thrust of the donor stellar wind, and thus precesses at the orbital period. The $\gamma$-ray modulation appears then owing to the variable Doppler boosting of synchrotron self-Compton jet emission. The model also fits well the data. However, the fitted bending angle is much larger than the theoretical one based on the binary and wind parameters as currently known. Thus, both models disagree with important aspects of our current theoretical understanding of the system. We discuss possible ways to find the correct model.

          Continuum emission from within the plunging region of black hole discs

 - **Abstract**
 The thermal continuum emission observed from accreting black holes across X-ray bands has the potential to be leveraged as a powerful probe of the mass and spin of the central black hole. The vast majority of existing ``continuum fitting'' models neglect emission sourced at and within the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the black hole. Numerical simulations, however, find non-zero emission sourced from these regions. In this work we extend existing techniques by including the emission sourced from within the plunging region, utilising new analytical models which reproduce the properties of numerical accretion simulations. We show that in general the neglected intra-ISCO emission produces a hot-and-small quasi-blackbody component, but can also produce a weak power-law tail for more extreme parameter regions. A similar hot-and-small blackbody component has been added in by hand in an ad-hoc manner to previous analyses of X-ray binary spectra. We show that the X-ray spectrum of MAXI J1820+070 in a soft-state outburst is extremely well described by a full Kerr black hole disc, while conventional models which neglect intra-ISCO emission are unable to reproduce the data. We believe this represents the first robust detection of intra-ISCO emission in the literature, and allows additional constraints to be placed on the MAXI J1820+070 black hole spin which must be low $a_\bullet < 0.5$ to allow a detectable intra-ISCO region. Emission from within the ISCO is the dominant emission component in the MAXI J1820+070 spectrum between $6$ and $10$ keV, highlighting the necessity of including this region. Our continuum fitting model is made publicly available.

          Fast formation of large ice pebbles after FU Orionis outbursts

 - **Abstract**
 During their formation, nascent planetary systems are subject to FU Orionis outbursts that heat a substantial part of the disc. This causes water ice in the affected part of the disc to sublimate as the ice line moves outwards to several to tens of astronomical units. In this paper, we investigate how the subsequent cooling of the disc impacts the particle sizes. We calculate the resulting particle sizes in a disc model with cooling times between 100 and 1,000 years, corresponding to typical FU Orionis outbursts. As the disc cools and the ice line retreats inwards, water vapour forms icy mantles on existing silicate particles. This process is called heterogeneous nucleation. The nucleation rate per surface area of silicate substrate strongly depends on the degree of super-saturation of the water vapour in the gas. Fast cooling results in high super-saturation levels, high nucleation rates, and limited condensation growth because the main ice budget is spent in the nucleation. Slow cooling, on the other hand, leads to rare ice nucleation and efficient growth of ice-nucleated particles by subsequent condensation. We demonstrate that close to the quiescent ice line, pebbles with a size of about centimetres to decimetres form by this process. The largest of these are expected to undergo cracking collisions. However, their Stokes numbers still reach values that are high enough to potentially trigger planetesimal formation by the streaming instability if the background turbulence is weak. Stellar outbursts may thus promote planetesimal formation around the water ice line in protoplanetary discs.

 - **Abstract**
 NASA's Juno mission provided exquisite measurements of Jupiter's gravity field that together with the Galileo entry probe atmospheric measurements constrains the interior structure of the giant planet. Inferring its interior structure range remains a challenging inverse problem requiring a computationally intensive search of combinations of various planetary properties, such as the cloud-level temperature, composition, and core features, requiring the computation of ~10^9 interior models. We propose an efficient deep neural network (DNN) model to generate high-precision wide-ranged interior models based on the very accurate but computationally demanding concentric MacLaurin spheroid (CMS) method. We trained a sharing-based DNN with a large set of CMS results for a four-layer interior model of Jupiter, including a dilute core, to accurately predict the gravity moments and mass, given a combination of interior features. We evaluated the performance of the trained DNN (NeuralCMS) to inspect its predictive limitations. NeuralCMS shows very good performance in predicting the gravity moments, with errors comparable with the uncertainty due to differential rotation, and a very accurate mass prediction. This allowed us to perform a broad parameter space search by computing only ~10^4 actual CMS interior models, resulting in a large sample of plausible interior structures, and reducing the computation time by a factor of 10^5. Moreover, we used a DNN explainability algorithm to analyze the impact of the parameters setting the interior model on the predicted observables, providing information on their nonlinear relation.

 - **Abstract**
 The QUIJOTE MFI instrument (2012-2018) observed the sky at four frequency bands, namely 11, 13, 17 and 19GHz, at 1 degree angular resolution. Using around 10000 h of observations in the so-called nominal mode, QUIJOTE MFI produced sky maps covering approximately 29000 deg2. Here we use the full database of MFI wide survey observations to characterize the correlation properties of the atmospheric signal in those frequency bands. This information will be useful to improve the current sky models at these frequencies, and could be used in further MFI reanalyses, or for the preparation of future observations at these frequencies (e.g., MFI2 and the Tenerife Microwave Spectrometer).

 - **Abstract**
 We present recent work on the Spectra of IceCube Neutrino (SIN) candidate sources project. We defined a selection of candidate neutrino sources by identifying blazars in the vicinity of IceCube's highest-energy neutrinos. We now want to shed light on these source candidates' nature, starting at their redshift, continuing with their black hole masses, their variability, and, for the first time, a combined photon-neutrino spectral energy distribution. We present their hybrid spectral energy distributions (combining photon and neutrino fluxes), investigate the sources' variability in the near-infrared, optical, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray bands, and compare the variability with a blazar sample of non-candidate sources. Furthermore, we search for flares at the arrival time of the high-energy neutrinos.

 - **Abstract**
 A magma ocean (MO) is thought to be a ubiquitous stage in the early evolution of rocky planets and exoplanets. During the lifetime of the MO, exchanges between the interior and exterior envelopes of the planet are very efficient. In particular, volatile elements that initially are contained in the solid part of the planet can be released and form a secondary outgassed atmosphere. We determine trends in the H-C-N-O-S composition and thickness of these secondary atmospheres for varying planetary sizes and MO extents, and the oxygen fugacity of MOs, which provides the main control for the atmospheric chemistry. We used a model with coupled chemical gas-gas and silicate melt-gas equilibria and mass conservation to predict the composition of an atmosphere at equilibrium with the MO depending on the planet size and the extent and redox state of the MO. We used a self-consistent mass-radius model for the rocky core to inform the structure of the planet, which we combined with an atmosphere model to predict the transit radius of lava worlds. We find that MOs (especially the shallow ones) on small planets are generally more reduced, and are thus dominated by H2-rich atmospheres (whose outgassing is strengthened at low planetary mass), while larger planets and deeper MOs vary from CO to CO2-N2-SO2 atmospheres, with increasing fO2 . In the former case, the low molecular mass of the atmosphere combined with the low gravity of the planets yields a large vertical extension of the atmosphere, while in the latter cases, secondary outgassed atmospheres on super-Earths are likely significantly shrunk. Both N and C are largely outgassed regardless of the conditions, while the S and H outgassing is strongly dependent on the fO2 , as well as on the planetary mass and MO extent for the latter.

 - **Abstract**
 ALMA's high-resolution images allow to resolve the filamentary structure of the ISM down to few thousand au at kpc distances. We aim to systematically quantify the impact of the interferometric response and the effects of the short-spacing information during the characterization of the ISM structure using ALMA observations. We create a series of continuum ALMA synthetic observations to test the recovery of the observational properties of dense cores and filaments (i.e. intensity peak, radial profile, and width) at different scales. We compare the results obtained with and without different data combination techniques using different ALMA arrays and SD telescopes in simulated data and real observations. Our analysis illustrates the severity of interferometric filtering effects. ALMA-12m alone observations show significant scale-dependent flux losses systematically corrupting (>30%error) all the physical properties inferred in cores and filaments (i.e. column density, mass, and size) before the maximum recoverable scale of the interferometer. These effects are only partially mitigated by the addition of the ALMA ACA-7m array although degrading the telescope PSF. Our results demonstrate only the addition of the ALMA Total Power information allows to recover the true sky emission down to few times the ALMA beamsize with satisfactory accuracy (<10% error). Additional tests demonstrate the emission recovery at all scales is further improved if the 7mTP data are replaced by maps obtained by a larger SD telescope (e.g., IRAM-30m), even if the latter are noisier than expected. These observational biases particularly affect partially resolved targets, becoming critical especially for studies in nearby regions such as Taurus or Orion. Our results demonstrate the need for the use of data combination techniques to accurately characterize the complex physical structure of the ISM in the ALMA era.

 - **Abstract**
 Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) become observable for the first time in 2021 since the Rosetta rendezvous in 2014--16. Here, we present pre-perihelion polarimetric measurements of 67P from 2021 performed with the Very Large Telescope (VLT), as well as post-perihelion polarimetric measurements from 2015--16 obtained with the VLT and the William Herschel Telescope (WHT). This new data covers a phase angle range of ~4-50° and presents polarimetric measurements of unprecedentedly high S/N ratio. Complementing previous measurements, the polarimetric phase curve of 67P resembles that of other Jupiter family comets and high-polarisation, dusty comets. Comparing pre- and post-perihelion data sets, we find only a marginal difference between the polarimetric phase curves. In our imaging maps, we detect various linear structures produced by the dust in the inner coma of the comet. Despite this, we find a homogeneous spread of polarisation around the photocentre throughout the coma and tail, in contrast to previous studies. Finally, we explore the consequences of image misalignments on both polarimetric maps and aperture polarimetric measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 In seven billion years, the Sun will be dead. As stars like the Sun pass from their present state to that of a dead white dwarf star, they undergo two phases of extremely high luminosity and radius -- the red giant branch and the asymptotic giant branch -- during which they will lose half or more of their mass. These changes to the star have a significant impact on orbiting planets, asteroids and comets. The large stellar radius (beyond the current orbit of the Earth) leads to the engulfment of bodies entering the stellar envelope, a process enhanced by strong tidal interactions. The high luminosity affects bodies' orbits and physical properties, while mass loss can later trigger the destabilisation of bodies around white dwarfs. It is necessary to understand these processes to understand both the future of our Solar System, and to interpret growing observations of planetary systems around evolved stars.

          Constraining UV freeze-in of light relics with current and next-generation CMB observations

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological observations allow to measure the abundance of light relics produced in the early Universe. Most studies focus on the thermal freeze-out scenario, yet light relics produced by freeze-in are generic for models in which new light degrees of freedom do not couple strongly enough to the Standard Model (SM) plasma to allow for full thermalization in the early Universe. In ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in scenarios, rates for light relic production associated with non-renormalizable interactions typical of beyond the SM (BSM) models grow with temperature more quickly than the Hubble rate. Thus, relatively small couplings to the SM can be probed by current and next-generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. We investigate several representative benchmark BSM models, such as axion-like particles from Primakoff production, massless dark photons and light right-handed neutrinos. We calculate contributions to the effective number of neutrino species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, in corners of parameter space not previously considered and discuss the sensitivity of CMB experiments compared to other probes. In contrast to freeze-out scenarios, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ from UV freeze-in is more dependent on both the specific BSM physics model and the reheating temperature. Depending on the details of the BSM scenario, we find that the sensitivity of next-generation CMB experiments can complement or surpass the current astrophysical, laboratory or collider constraints on the couplings of the SM to the light relic.

          The asymmetry of dawn: evidence for asymmetric reionization histories from a joint analysis of cosmic microwave background and astrophysical data

 - **Abstract**
 We show that by jointly fitting cosmic microwave background (CMB) and astrophysical data - a compilation of UV luminosity data from the Hubble Frontier Field and neutral hydrogen data from distant sources-, we can infer on the shape of the evolution of the ionized hydrogen fraction with redshift in addition to constraining the average optical depth $\tau$.For this purpose, we introduce here a novel extended model that includes hydrogen ionization histories which are monotonic with redshift, but allow for an asymmetry as indicated from our previous works on a free reconstruction of reionization. By using our baseline data combination, we obtain $\tau=0.0542^{+0.0017}_{-0.0028}$, consistent with our previous works and tighter than the one inferred by Planck 2018 data because of the combination of CMB with astrophysical data. We find that the symmetric hypothesis within our parametrization is disfavoured at 4 $\sigma$.We test our findings by using alternative likelihoods for CMB polarization at low multipoles, i.e. based on the 2020 reprocessing of Planck HFI data or on the joint analysis of WMAP and Planck LFI data, obtaining consistent results that disfavour the symmetric hypothesis of the reionization history at high statistical significant level.These results will be further tested by more precise astrophysical data such as from JWST and Euclid deep fields.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a time-domain model for the gravitational waves emitted by equal-mass binary neutron star merger remnants for a fixed equation of state. We construct a large set of numerical relativity simulations for a single equation of state consistent with current constraints, totaling 157 equal-mass binary neutron star merger configurations. The gravitational-wave model is constructed using the supervised learning method of K-nearest neighbor regression. As a first step toward developing a general model with supervised learning methods that accounts for the dependencies on equation of state and the binary masses of the system, we explore the impact of the size of the dataset on the model. We assess the accuracy of the model for a varied dataset size and number density in total binary mass. Specifically, we consider five training sets of $\{ 20,40, 60, 80, 100\}$ simulations uniformly distributed in total binary mass. We evaluate the resulting models in terms of faithfulness using a test set of 30 additional simulations that are not used during training and which are equidistantly spaced in total binary mass. The models achieve faithfulness with maximum values in the range of $0.980$ to $0.995$. We assess our models simulating signals observed by the three-detector network of Advanced LIGO-Virgo. We find that all models with training sets of size equal to or larger than $40$ achieve an unbiased measurement of the main gravitational-wave frequency. We confirm that our results do not depend qualitatively on the choice of the (fixed) equation of state. We conclude that training sets, with a minimum size of $40$ simulations, or a number density of approximately $11$ simulations per $0.1\,M_\odot$ of total binary mass, suffice for the construction of faithful templates for the post-merger signal for a single equation of state and equal-mass binaries (abbreviated).
