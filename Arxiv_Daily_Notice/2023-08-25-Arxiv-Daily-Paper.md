 - **Abstract**
 Eccentric orbits can be decomposed into a series of sine curves which affects how the false alarm probability is computed when using traditional periodograms on radial-velocity data. Here we show that a candidate exoplanet orbiting the M dwarf GJ 9404, identified by the HADES survey using data from the HARPS-N spectrograph, is in fact a bona-fide planet on a highly eccentric orbit. Far from a candidate, GJ 9404 b is detected with a high confidence. We reach our conclusion using two methods that assume Keplerian functions rather than sines to compute a detection probability, a Bayes Factor, and the FIP periodogram. We compute these using nested sampling with {\tt kima}.
#### The VLT MUSE NFM view of outflows and externally photoevaporating discs  near the Orion Bar

 - **Abstract**
 We present VLT/MUSE Narrow Field Mode (NFM) observations of a pair of disc-bearing young stellar objects towards the Orion Bar: 203-504 and 203-506. Both of these discs are subject to external photoevaporation, where winds are launched from their outer regions due to environmental irradiation. Intriguingly, despite having projected separation from one another of only 1.65{\arcsec} (660au at 400pc), 203-504 has a classic teardrop shaped ``proplyd'' morphology pointing towards $\theta^2$Ori A (indicating irradiation by the EUV of that star, rather than $\theta^1$ Ori C) but 203-506 has no ionisation front, indicating it is not irradiated by stellar EUV at all. However, 203-506 does show [CI] 8727{\AA} and [OI] 6300{\AA} in emission, indicating irradiation by stellar FUV. This explicitly demonstrates the importance of FUV irradiation in driving mass loss from discs. We conclude that shielding of 203-506 from EUV is most likely due to its position on the observers side of an ionized layer lying in the foreground of the Huygens Region. We demonstrate that the outflow HH 519, previously thought to be emanating from 203-504 is actually an irradiated cloud edge and identify a new compact outflow from that object approximately along our line of sight with a velocity $\sim130$\,km\,s$^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to address fundamental questions related to the expansion history of the Universe and its primordial nature with the next generation of galaxy experiments, we need to model reliably large-scale structure observables such as the correlation function and the power spectrum. Cosmological $N$-body simulations provide a reference through which we can test our models, but their output suffers from sample variance on large scales. Fortunately, this is the regime where accurate analytic approximations exist. To reduce the variance, which is key to making optimal use of these simulations, we can leverage the accuracy and precision of such analytic descriptions using Control Variates (CV). We apply two control variate formulations to mock catalogs generated in anticipation of upcoming data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to test the robustness of its analysis pipeline. Our CV-reduced measurements, of the power spectrum and correlation function, both pre- and post-reconstruction, offer a factor of 5-10 improvement in the measurement error compared with the raw measurements from the DESI mock catalogs. We explore the relevant properties of the galaxy samples that dictate this reduction and comment on the improvements we find on some of the derived quantities relevant to Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) analysis. We also provide an optimized package for computing the power spectra and other two-point statistics of an arbitrary galaxy catalog as well as a pipeline for obtaining CV-reduced measurements on any of the AbacusSummit cubic box outputs. We make our scripts, notebooks, and benchmark tests against existing software publicly available and report a speed improvement of a factor of $\sim$10 for a grid size of $N_{\rm mesh} = 256^3$ compared with $\texttt{nbodykit}$.
#### Evolution of eccentric stellar disks around supermassive black holes:  the complex disk disruption dynamics and the milliparsec stars
 - **Authors:** Antti Rantala, Thorsten Naab

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.12344
 - **Abstract**
 We study the 10 Myr evolution of parsec-scale stellar disks with initial masses of $M_{\mathrm{disk}} = 1.0$ - $7.5 \times 10^4 M_\odot$ and eccentricities $e_\mathrm{init}=0.1$-$0.9$ around supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Our disk models are embedded in a spherical background potential and have top-heavy single and binary star initial mass functions (IMF) with slopes of $0.25$-$1.7$. The systems are evolved with the N-body code $\texttt{BIFROST}$ including post-Newtonian (PN) equations of motion and simplified stellar evolution. All disks are unstable and evolve on Myr timescales towards similar eccentricity distributions peaking at $e_\star \sim 0.3$-$0.4$. Models with high $e_\mathrm{init}$ also develop a very eccentric $(e_\star\gtrsim0.9)$ stellar population. For higher disk masses $M_\mathrm{disk} \gtrsim3 \times10^4\;\mathrm{M_\odot}$, the disk disruption dynamics is more complex than the standard secular eccentric disk instability with opposite precession directions at different disk radii - a precession direction instability. We present an analytical model describing this behavior. A milliparsec population of $N\sim10$-$100$ stars forms around the SMBH in all models. For low $e_\mathrm{init}$ stars migrate inward while for $e_\mathrm{init}\gtrsim0.6$ stars are captured by the Hills mechanism. Without PN, after $6$ Myr the captured stars have a sub-thermal eccentricity distribution. We show that including PN effects prevents this thermalization by suppressing resonant relaxation effects and cannot be ignored. The number of tidally disrupted stars is similar or larger than the number of milliparsec stars. None of the simulated models can simultaneously reproduce the kinematic and stellar population properties of the Milky Way center clockwise disk and the S-cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider a model of early modified gravity (EMG) that was recently proposed as a candidate to resolve the Hubble tension. The model consists in a scalar field $\sigma$ with a non-minimal coupling (NMC) to the Ricci curvature of the form $F(\sigma) = M_{\mathrm{pl}}^2+\xi\sigma^2$ and an effective mass induced by a quartic potential $V(\sigma) = \lambda \sigma^4/4$. We present the first analyses of the EMG model in light of the latest ACT DR4 and SPT-3G data in combination with full Planck data, and find a $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ preference for a non-zero EMG contribution from a combination of primary CMB data alone, mostly driven by ACT DR4 data. This is different from popular 'Early Dark Energy' models, which are detected only when the high-$\ell$ information from Planck temperature is removed. We find that the NMC plays a key role in controlling the evolution of density perturbations that is favored by the data over the minimally coupled case. Including measurements of supernovae luminosity distance from Pantheon+, baryonic acoustic oscillations and growth factor from BOSS, and CMB lensing of Planck leaves the preference unaffected. In the EMG model, the tension with S$H_0$ES is alleviated from $\sim 6\sigma$ to $\sim 3\sigma$. Further adding S$H_0$ES data rise the detection of the EMG model above $5\sigma$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a NASA Small Explorer (SMEX) satellite mission in development with a planned launch in 2027. COSI is a wide-field gamma-ray telescope designed to survey the entire sky at 0.2-5 MeV. It provides imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetry of astrophysical sources, and its germanium detectors provide excellent energy resolution for emission line measurements. Science goals for COSI include studies of 0.511 MeV emission from antimatter annihilation in the Galaxy, mapping radioactive elements from nucleosynthesis, determining emission mechanisms and source geometries with polarization measurements, and detecting and localizing multimessenger sources. The instantaneous field of view for the germanium detectors is >25% of the sky, and they are surrounded on the sides and bottom by active shields, providing background rejection as well as allowing for detection of gamma-ray bursts and other gamma-ray flares over most of the sky. In the following, we provide an overview of the COSI mission, including the science, the technical design, and the project status.

 - **Abstract**
 Transient radio sources, such as fast radio bursts, intermittent pulsars, and rotating radio transients, can offer a wealth of information regarding extreme emission physics as well as the intervening interstellar and/or intergalactic medium. Vital steps towards understanding these objects include characterizing their source populations and estimating their event rates across observing frequencies. However, previous efforts have been undertaken mostly by individual survey teams at disparate observing frequencies and telescopes, and with non-uniform algorithms for searching and characterization. The Petabyte Project (TPP) aims to address these issues by uniformly reprocessing data from several petabytes of radio transient surveys covering two decades of observing frequency (300 MHz-20 GHz). The TPP will provide robust event rate analyses, in-depth assessment of survey and pipeline completeness, as well as revealing discoveries from archival and ongoing radio surveys. We present an overview of TPP's processing pipeline, scope, and our potential to make new discoveries.

 - **Abstract**
 The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect a wide variety of gravitational wave sources in the mHz band. Some of these signals will elude individual detection, instead contributing as confusion noise to one of several stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWBs) -- notably including the `Galactic foreground', a loud signal resulting from the superposition of millions of unresolved double white dwarf binaries (DWDs) in the Milky Way. It is possible that similar, weaker SGWBs will be detectable from other DWD populations in the local universe, including the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We use the Bayesian LISA Inference Package ($\tt{BLIP}$) to evaluate the detectability by LISA of an anisotropic SGWB generated by unresolved DWDs in the LMC. To do so, we simulate the LMC SGWB from a realistic DWD population generated via binary population synthesis, simulate four years of time-domain data with $\tt{BLIP}$ comprised of stochastic contributions from the LMC SGWB and the LISA detector noise, and analyze this data with $\tt{BLIP}$'s spherical harmonic anisotropic SGWB search. We present results of this analysis and show that the SGWB from DWDs in the LMC is potentially detectable by LISA.

 - **Abstract**
 Nebular-phase observations of peculiar Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide important constraints on progenitor scenarios and explosion dynamics for both these rare SNe and the more common, cosmologically useful SNe Ia. We present observations from an extensive ground-based and space-based follow-up campaign to characterize SN 2022pul, a "super-Chandrasekhar" mass SN Ia (alternatively "03fg-like" SN), from before peak brightness to well into the nebular phase across optical to mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths. The early rise of the light curve is atypical, exhibiting two distinct components, consistent with SN Ia ejecta interacting with dense carbon-oxygen rich circumstellar material (CSM). In the optical, SN 2022pul is most similar to SN 2012dn, having a low estimated peak luminosity ($M_{B}=-18.9$ mag) and high photospheric velocity relative to other 03fg-like SNe. In the nebular phase, SN 2022pul adds to the increasing diversity of the 03fg-like subclass. From 168 to 336 days after peak $B$-band brightness, SN 2022pul exhibits asymmetric and narrow emission from [O I] $\lambda\lambda 6300,\ 6364$ (${\rm FWHM} \approx 2{,}000$ km s$^{-1}$), strong, broad emission from [Ca II] $\lambda\lambda 7291,\ 7323$ (${\rm FWHM} \approx 7{,}300$ km s$^{-1}$), and a rapid Fe III to Fe II ionization change. Finally, we present the first-ever optical-to-mid-infrared (MIR) nebular spectrum of an 03fg-like SN Ia using data from JWST. In the MIR, strong lines of neon and argon, weak emission from stable nickel, and strong thermal dust emission (with $T \approx 500$ K), combined with prominent [O I] in the optical, suggest that SN 2022pul was produced by a white dwarf merger within carbon/oxygen-rich CSM.
#### Ground-based and JWST Observations of SN 2022pul: II. Evidence from  Nebular Spectroscopy for a Violent Merger in a Peculiar Type-Ia Supernova

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of ground-based and JWST observations of SN 2022pul, a peculiar "03fg-like" (or "super-Chandrasekhar") Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), in the nebular phase at 338 d post explosion. Our combined spectrum continuously covers 0.4-14 $\mu$m and includes the first mid-infrared spectrum of an 03fg-like SN Ia. Compared to normal SN Ia 2021aefx, SN 2022pul exhibits a lower mean ionization state, asymmetric emission-line profiles, stronger emission from the intermediate-mass elements (IMEs) argon and calcium, weaker emission from iron-group elements (IGEs), and the first unambiguous detection of neon in a SN Ia. Strong, broad, centrally peaked [Ne II] at 12.81 $\mu$m was previously predicted as a hallmark of "violent merger'' SN Ia models, where dynamical interaction between two sub-$M_{\text{Ch}}$ white dwarfs (WDs) causes disruption of the lower mass WD and detonation of the other. The violent merger scenario was already a leading hypothesis for 03fg-like SNe Ia; in SN 2022pul it can explain the large-scale ejecta asymmetries seen between the IMEs and IGEs and the central location of narrow oxygen and broad neon. We modify extant models to add clumping of the central ejecta to better reproduce the optical iron emission, and add mass in the innermost region ($< 2000$ km s$^{-1}$) to account for the observed narrow [O I] $\lambda\lambda6300$, 6364 emission. A violent WD-WD merger explains many of the observations of SN 2022pul, and our results favor this model interpretation for the subclass of 03fg-like SN Ia.

 - **Abstract**
 The Compton Pair (ComPair) telescope is a prototype that aims to develop the necessary technologies for future medium energy gamma-ray missions and to design, build, and test the prototype in a gamma-ray beam and balloon flight. The ComPair team has built an instrument that consists of 4 detector subsystems: a double-sided silicon strip detector Tracker, a novel high-resolution virtual Frisch-grid cadmium zinc telluride Calorimeter, and a high-energy hodoscopic cesium iodide Calorimeter, all of which are surrounded by a plastic scintillator anti-coincidence detector. These subsystems together detect and characterize photons via Compton scattering and pair production, enable a veto of cosmic rays, and are a proof-of-concept for a space telescope with the same architecture. A future medium-energy gamma-ray mission enabled through ComPair will address many questions posed in the Astro2020 Decadal survey in both the New Messengers and New Physics and the Cosmic Ecosystems themes. In this contribution, we will give an overview of the ComPair project and steps forward to the balloon flight.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiation feedback from massive population III stars may have given rise to low mass star formation from primordial or nearly primordial material. If early universe low mass stars did form, some should remain locally as white dwarfs, sub-giants, or main sequence stars. In this paper, we present model calculations for the evolution of single 0.8 Msun to 3.0 Msun stars with primordial metallicity from pre-main sequence to the white dwarf cooling track, and calculations for the evolution of single 4.0 Msun to 7.0 Msun stars which conclude in the giant phase. One goal of this work is to identify potential observable markers for potential observed progenitors of first or nearly first stars. We uncover a number of seemingly peculiar evolutionary differences between that of pop III low mass stars compared with younger higher Z stars, as well as compared to other primordial evolution models. We also present an initial-final mass relationship and identify the minimum mass of a single white dwarf that could have had a population III progenitor.

 - **Abstract**
 Using young open clusters and O--B2-type stars in~\emph{Gaia}~DR3, we investigate the kinematics of the local spiral structure. In general, the young sources in the outer spiral arms may present larger peculiar motions than those in the inner spiral arms. The young open clusters appear to have smaller peculiar motions than the O--B2-type stars, and the sources in both the Perseus and Local Arms may show an inward motion toward the Galactic center and rotate slower than Galactic rotation. Meanwhile, the sources in the Carina Arm may move in the opposite direction from the Sun to the Galactic center and rotate marginally faster than Galactic rotation. In addition, using young open clusters and O--B2-type stars, we have improved the distance estimations of kinematic methods for several regions near the Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first set of broadband spectral and timing studies of two transient X-ray pulsars, MXB 0656-072 and MAXI J1409-619 using NuSTAR observations conducted during quiescence. Despite being captured at one of their lowest luminosity states, both these targets show signs of ongoing low-level accretion. Results from the time-averaged spectral analysis indicate for the first time, the presence of a strong soft power law component along with thermal emission from the neutron star hot spots. For both targets, the quiescent thermal X-ray emission is consistent with the deep crustal heating model. In MXB 0656-072, we do not detect any pulsations or indications of a cyclotron line during quiescence. However, in MAXI J1409-619 we detect strong pulsations at 502 s with a pulsed fraction of $\sim$66%, which adds this pulsar to the list of a handful of quiescent-state pulsating systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Dust particles in protoplanetary disks experience various chemical reactions under different physicochemical conditions through their accretion and diffusion, which results in the radial chemical gradient of dust. We performed three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the dust trajectories and the progress of fictitious irreversible reactions, of which kinetics is expressed by the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami equation. The distribution of the highest temperature that each particle experiences before the degree of reaction exceeds a certain level shows the log-normal distribution, and its mode temperature was used as the effective reaction temperature. Semi-analytical prediction formulas of the effective reaction temperature and its dispersion were derived by comparing a reaction timescale with a diffusive transport timescale of dust as a function of the reaction parameters and the disk parameters. The formulas reproduce the numerical results of the effective reaction temperatures and their dispersions within 5.5 and 24 %, respectively, in a wide temperature range (200-1400 K). We applied the formulas for the crystallization of amorphous silicate dust and its oxygen isotope exchange with the H2O vapor based on the experimentally determined kinetics. For sub-micron sized amorphous forsterite dust, the predicted effective reaction temperature for the oxygen isotope exchange was lower than that of crystallization without overlap even considering their dispersions. This suggests that the amorphous silicate dust in the protosolar disk could exchange their oxygen isotopes efficiently with the 16O-poor H2O vapor, resulting in the distinct oxygen isotope compositions from the Sun.
#### On the origin of quasi-periodicity in the atmospheres of Earth, Jupiter,  Saturn and the Sun

 - **Abstract**
 This paper explores a possible linkage between solar motion about the solar system center of mass and the quasi-periodicity evident in the pressure and temperature of planet atmospheres. We establish that dominant mid frequency range periodicity in planet atmospheres corresponds closely to the harmonic series 39.5/n = TA/n years where n = 2, 3, 4, etc. We establish that the period TA = 39.5 years is the interval between acceleration impulses experienced by the Sun as it passes close to the solar system center of mass and that the time sequence of impulses generates the spectral harmonic series TA/n that is observed in the periodicity of climate indices like the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Quasi Biennial Oscillation. We develop a model of a simple harmonic oscillator responding to periodic acceleration impulses and show that the response duplicates several features of the Quasi Biennial Oscillation. We conclude that oscillatory phenomena observed in solar activity and in planet atmosphere variability could be due to the response of the various natural oscillatory modes to impulsive Sun acceleration associated with planetary motion.

 - **Abstract**
 The solar inner corona is a region that plays a critical role in energizing the solar wind and propelling it to supersonic and supra-Alfvenic velocities. Despite its importance, this region remains poorly understood because of being least explored due to observational limitations. The coronal radio sounding technique in this context becomes useful as it helps in providing information in parts of this least explored region. To shed light on the dynamics of the solar wind in the inner corona, we conducted a study using data obtained from coronal radio-sounding experiments carried out by the Akatsuki spacecraft during the 2021 Venus-solar conjunction event. By analyzing X-band radio signals recorded at two ground stations (IDSN in Bangalore and UDSC in Japan), we investigated plasma turbulence characteristics and estimated flow speed measurements based on isotropic quasi-static turbulence models. Our analysis revealed that the speed of the solar wind in the inner corona (at heliocentric distances from 5 to 13 solar radii), ranging from 220-550 km/sec, was higher than the expected average flow speeds in this region. By integrating our radio-sounding results with EUV images of the solar disk, we gained a unique perspective on the properties and energization of high-velocity plasma streams originating from coronal holes. We tracked the evolution of fast solar wind streams emanating from an extended coronal hole as they propagated to increasing heliocentric distances. Our study provides unique insights into the least-explored inner coronal region by corroborating radio sounding results with EUV observations of the corona.

 - **Abstract**
 Precipitable water vapor (PWV) strongly affects the quality of data obtained from millimeter- and submillimeter-wave astronomical observations, such as those for cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements. Some of these observatories have used radiometers to monitor PWV. In this study, PWV was measured from April 2021 to April 2022 using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) instruments in the Atacama Desert, Chile, where several millimeter and submillimeter-wave telescopes are located. We evaluated the accuracy of these measurements by comparing them to radiometer measurements. We calculated the PWV from GNSS data using Canadian Spatial Reference System Precise Point Positioning (CSRS-PPP), an online software package. When using GNSS data alone, the estimated PWV showed a systematic offset of +1.08 mm. When combining GNSS data with data from a barometer which was co-located with the GNSS receiver, the estimated PWV showed a lower systematic offset of -0.14 mm. The GNSS PWV showed a statistical error of 0.52 mm with an averaging time of an hour. Compared to other PWV measurement methods, GNSS instruments are robust in bad weather conditions, have sufficient time resolution, and are less expensive. By demonstrating good accuracy and precision in low PWV conditions, this paper shows that GNSS instruments are valuable tools for PWV measurements for observing site evaluation and data analysis for ground-based telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 While Gamma-Ray Burst (GRBs) are clear and distinct observed events, every individual GRB is unique. In fact, GRBs are known for their variable behaviour, and BATSE was already able to discover two categories of GRB from the T90 distribution; the short and long GRBs. These two categories match up with the expected two types of GRB progenitors. Nowadays, more features have been found to be able to further distinguish them, such as the hardness ratio or the presence of supernovae. However, that does not mean that it is by any means simple to categorise individual GRBs. Furthermore, more GRB categories have been theorised as well, such as low-luminosity or X-ray-rich GRBs. These different types of GRBs also could indicate a different neutrino spectrum, with different types of GRBs more likely to emit higher amounts of neutrinos. We present an ongoing effort to use machine learning to categorise and classify GRBs, searching for subpopulations that could yield a larger neutrino flux. We specifically use unsupervised learning, as it allows hidden patterns and correlations to come to light. With the help of features such as the T90, hardness, fluence, SNR, spectral index and even the full light curve and spectra, different structures and categories of Gamma-Ray bursts can be found.

 - **Abstract**
 Optical spectroscopy offers the most direct view of the stellar properties and the accretion indicators. Standard accretion tracers, such as $H\beta$, $H\alpha$, and, Ca II triplet lines, and most photospheric features, fall in the optical wavelengths. However, these tracers are not readily observable from deeply embedded protostars because of the large line of sight extinction (Av $\sim$ 50-100 mag) toward them. In some cases, however, it is possible to observe protostars at optical wavelengths if the outflow cavity is aligned along the line-of-sight that allows observations of the photosphere, or the envelope is very tenuous and thin such that the extinction is low. In such cases, we can not only detect these protostars at optical wavelengths but also follow up spectroscopically. We have used the HOPS catalog (Furlan et al. 2016) of protostars in Orion to search for optical counterparts for protostars in the Gaia DR3 survey. Out of the 330 protostars in the HOPS sample, an optical counterpart within 2" is detected for 62 of the protostars. For 17 out of 62 optically detected protostars, we obtained optical spectra { (between 5500 to 8900 $\AA$) using the Aries-Devasthal Faint Object Spectrograph \& Camera (ADFOSC) on the 3.6-m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) and Hanle Faint Object Spectrograph Camera (HFOSC) on 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT)}. We detect strong photospheric features, such as the TiO bands in the spectra {(of 4 protostars)}, hinting that photospheres can form early on in the star formation process. We further determined the spectral types of protostars, which show photospheres similar to a late M-type. Mass accretion rates derived for the protostars are similar to those found for T-Tauri stars, in the range of 10$^{-7}$ to 10$^{-8}$ $M_\odot$/yr.

 Aims. We carry out the self-consistent dynamic evolution of the orbital structure of Milky Way globular clusters. This allows us to estimate possible and probable close passages and even collisions of the clusters with each other. Methods. We reproduced the orbits of 147 globular clusters in 10 Gyr lookback time using our own high-order N-body parallel dynamic phi-GPU code. The initial conditions (three coordinates and three velocities for the present time) were derived from the Gaia DR3 catalogue. The galaxy is represented by five external potentials from the IllustrisTNG-100, whose masses and sizes of the disk and halo components are similar to the physical values of the Milky Way at present. Results. We present a statistical analysis of the cumulative close passages rate: About ten close passages with relative distances shorter than 50 pc for every billion years for each of the five external potentials. We present the 22 most reliable collision pairs with a good probability. As an example: Terzan 4 versus Terzan 2 (49%), Terzan 4 versus NGC 6624 (44%), Terzan 4 versus Terzan 5 (40%), Terzan 4 versus NGC 6440 (40%), and Terzan 4 versus Liller 1 (42%). The most active globular cluster in the collision sense is Terzan 4, which has 5.65 collision events on average (averaged over all individual 1000 initial condition realisations). Most collisions are located inside the Galactic disk and form two ring-like structures. The first ring-like structure has the highest collision number density at 1 kpc, and the second sturcture has a maximum at 2 kpc. Conclusions. Based on our numerical simulations, we can conclude that the few dozen Milky Way globular clusters probably undergo some close encounters and even possible collisions during their lifetimes, which can significantly affect their individual dynamical evolution and possibly even their stellar content.

 - **Abstract**
 Slow-roll of the inflaton field defines the standard dynamics of the inflationary epoch. However, the inflationary system deviates from slow-roll when it encounters an extremely flat region of the inflaton potential, and enters a phase dubbed Ultra slow roll. In this article, we explore the possibility of realizing an Ultra slow-roll phase in a particularly interesting inflationary scenario, called Warm Inflation. In the Warm inflationary scenario a thermalized, sub-dominant radiation bath coexists with the inflaton energy density as an effect of dissipative dynamics. We show in this article that though the background dynamics indicate Ultra slow-roll when the potential becomes extremely flat, in Warm Inflation models, where the dissipation coefficient is a sole function of the temperature of the radiation bath, the system fails to maintain the thermal equilibrium as soon as it enters the Ultra slow-roll phase. As thermal equilibrium is a key feature of Warm Inflation, and as it is not yet known how to deal with Warm Inflation without thermal equilibrium, we could not analyze such systems any further in this article. However, we demonstrate that brief periods of Ultra slow-roll phase, which smoothly ends into standard slow-roll, can be accommodated in WI models where the dissipation coefficient is not only a function of the temperature of the radiation bath but also depends on the amplitude of the inflaton field. We theoretically determine the criteria of successfully embedding Ultra slow-roll in WI while the system remain in thermal equilibrium, and also demonstrate numerically that such short Ultra slow-roll phases can indeed be embedded in specific Warm Inflation models which comply with the theoretically determined criteria.

 - **Abstract**
 For over 15 years the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) has been monitoring the entire high-energy gamma-ray sky, providing the best sampled 0.1 -- $>1$ TeV photons to this day. As a result, the Fermi-LAT has been serving the time-domain and multi-messenger community as the main source of gamma-ray activity alerts. All of this makes the Fermi-LAT a key instrument towards understanding the underlying physics behind the most extreme objects in the universe. However, generating mission-long LAT light curves can be very computationally expensive. The Fermi-LAT light curve repository (LCR) tackles this issue. The LCR is a public library of gamma-ray light curves for 1525 Fermi-LAT sources deemed variable in the 4FGL-DR2 catalog. The repository consists of light curves on timescales of days, weeks, and months, generated through a full-likelihood unbinned analysis of the source and surrounding region, providing flux and photon index measurements for each time interval. Hosted at NASA's FSSC, the library provides users with access to this continually updated light curve data, further serving as a resource to the time-domain and multi-messenger communities.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical shocks create cosmic rays by accelerating charged particles to relativistic speeds. However, the relative contribution of various types of shocks to the cosmic ray spectrum is still the subject of ongoing debate. Numerical studies have shown that in the non-relativistic regime, oblique shocks are capable of accelerating cosmic rays, depending on the Alfv\'enic Mach number of the shock. We now seek to extend this study into the mildly relativistic regime. In this case, dependence of the ion reflection rate on the shock obliquity is different compared to the nonrelativistic regime. Faster relativistic shocks are perpendicular for the majority of shock obliquity angles therefore their ability to initialize efficient DSA is limited. We define the ion injection rate using fully kinetic PIC simulation where we follow the formation of the shock and determine the fraction of ions that gets involved into formation of the shock precursor in the mildly relativistic regime covering a Lorentz factor range from 1 to 3. Then, with this result, we use a combined PIC-MHD method to model the large-scale evolution of the shock with the ion injection recipe dependent on the local shock obliquity. This methodology accounts for the influence of the self-generated or pre-existing upstream turbulence on the shock obliquity which allows study substantially larger and longer simulations compared to classical hybrid techniques.

 The Cherenkov Telescope Array is the next generation of observatory using imaging air Cherenkov technique for very-high-energy gamma-ray astronomy. Its first prototype telescope is operational on-site at La Palma and its data acquisitions allowed to detect known sources, study new ones, and to confirm the performance expectations. The application of deep learning for the reconstruction of the incident particle physical properties (energy, direction of arrival and type) have shown promising results when conducted on simulations. Nevertheless, its application to real observational data is challenging because deep-learning-based models can suffer from domain shifts. In the present article, we address this issue by implementing domain adaptation methods into state-of-art deep learning models for Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes event reconstruction to reduce the domain discrepancies, and we shed light on the gain in performance that they bring along.

 - **Abstract**
 Searching for the sources of high-energy cosmic particles requires sophisticated analysis techniques, frequently involving hypothesis tests with unbinned log-likelihood (LLH) functions. SkyLLH is an open-source, Python-based software tool to build these LLH functions and perform likelihood-ratio tests. We present a new easy-to-use and modular extension of SkyLLH that allows the user to perform neutrino point source searches in the entire sky using ten years of IceCube public data. To guide the user, SkyLLH provides tutorials showing how to analyze the experimental data and calculate useful statistical quantities. Here we describe the details of the analysis workflow and illustrate some of the possible methods to work with the IceCube public dataset. Additionally, we show that SkyLLH can reproduce the results from a previous IceCube publication that used the public data release. We obtain a similar local significance for the neutrino emission from a list of candidate sources within a maximum shift of 0.5$\sigma$. Finally, the measured neutrino flux from the most significant source candidate, NGC 1068, shows substantial agreement with the previously published result.

 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a one-cubic-kilometer-sized neutrino telescope deployed deep in the Antarctic ice at the South Pole. One of IceCube's major goals is finding the origins of astrophysical high-energy neutrinos. In 2022, IceCube identified the strongest point-like neutrino source so far, the active galaxy NGC 1068. Analyzing 9 years of muon-neutrino data from the Northern Sky recorded between 2011 and 2020, the emission from NGC 1068 is significant at 4.2$\,\sigma$. We present a planned extension to this search with additional years of data. One of these years includes data from 2010 when IceCube was only partially constructed. We discuss the improvement in sensitivity and discovery potential for neutrino point sources across the Northern sky. We show that by building on the established analysis techniques, previous observations could be improved, not only for NGC 1068 but for all possible sources in the Northern sky.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to combine asteroseismology, spectroscopy, and evolutionary models to establish a comprehensive picture of the evolution of Galactic blue supergiant stars (BSG). To start such an investigation, we selected three BSG candidates for our analysis: HD 42087 (PU Gem), HD 52089 ($\epsilon$ CMa) and HD 58350 ($\eta$ CMa). These stars show pulsations and were suspected to be in an evolutionary stage either preceding or succeding the red supergiant (RSG) stage. For our analysis, we utilized the 2-min cadence TESS data to study the photometric variability and obtained new spectroscopic observations at the CASLEO observatory. We calculated CMFGEN non-LTE radiative transfer models and derived stellar and wind parameters using the iterative spectral analysis pipeline XTGRID. The spectral modeling was limited to changing only the effective temperature, surface gravity, CNO abundances, and mass-loss rates. Finally, we compared the derived metal abundances with predictions from Geneva stellar evolution models. The frequency spectra of all three stars show either stochastic oscillations, nonradial strange modes, or a rotational splitting. We conclude that the rather short sectoral observing windows of TESS prevent establishing a reliable mode identification of low frequencies connected to mass-loss variabilities. The spectral analysis confirmed gradual changes in the mass-loss rates and the derived CNO abundances comply with the values reported in the literature. We were able to achieve a quantitative match with stellar evolution models for the stellar masses and luminosities. However, the spectroscopic surface abundances turned out to be inconsistent with theoretical predictions. The stars show N enrichment, typical for CNO cycle processed material, but the abundance ratios do not reflect the associated levels of C and O depletion.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV-PeV range by IceCube marked the start of neutrino astronomy, and the search for their sources continues. Two promising source candidates have been identified by IceCube: NGC 1068 in the 1 TeV-10 TeV range and TXS 0506+056 in the 0.1-1 PeV range. Both sources have gamma-ray counterparts, but additional time information of both neutrinos and gamma rays were essential for the identification of TXS 0506+056. The Planetary Neutrino Monitoring (PLEnuM) concept is an approach for combining the exposures of all current and future neutrino observatories - such as KM3NeT, Baikal-GVD, P-ONE in the Northern Hemisphere, and IceCube-Gen2 in the Southern Hemisphere. Using this PLEnuM approach, we estimate how the detection capability for transient sources candidates like blazars and GRBs improves once the future neutrino observatories come online. In addition, we present how the combined, instantaneous field of view of PLEnuM improves the real-time detection rate of rare, very-high-energy neutrinos across the entire sky.

 - **Abstract**
 Inertial wave modes in the Sun are of interest owing to their potential to reveal new insight into the solar interior. These predominantly retrograde-propagating modes in the solar subsurface appear to deviate from the thin-shell Rossby-Haurwitz model at high azimuthal orders. We present new measurements of sectoral equatorial inertial modes at $m>15$ where the modes appear to become progressively less retrograde compared to the canonical Rossby-Haurwitz dispersion relation in a co-rotating frame. We use a spectral eigenvalue solver to compute the spectrum of solar inertial modes in the presence of differential rotation. Focussing specifically on equatorial Rossby modes, we find that the numerically obtained mode frequencies lie along distinct ridges, one of which lies strikingly close to the observed mode frequencies in the Sun. We also find that the $n=0$ ridge is deflected strongly in the retrograde direction. This suggests that the solar measurements may not correspond to the fundamental $n=0$ Rossby-Haurwitz solutions as was initially suspected, but to a those for a higher $n$. The numerically obtained eigenfunctions also appear to sit deep within the convection zone -- unlike those for the $n=0$ modes -- which differs substantially from solar measurements and complicates inference.
#### Partially-ionised two-fluid shocks with collisional and radiative  ionisation and recombination -- multi-level hydrogen model

 - **Abstract**
 Explosive phenomena are known to trigger a wealth of shocks in warm plasma environments, including the solar chromosphere and molecular clouds where the medium consists of both ionised and neutral species. Partial ionisation is critical in determining the behaviour of shocks, since the ions and neutrals locally decouple, allowing for substructure to exist within the shock. Accurately modelling partially ionised shocks requires careful treatment of the ionised and neutral species, and their interactions. Here we study a partially-ionised switch-off slow-mode shock using a multi-level hydrogen model with both collisional and radiative ionisation and recombination rates that are implemented into the two-fluid (P\underline{I}P) code, and study physical parameters that are typical of the solar chromosphere. The multi-level hydrogen model differs significantly from MHD solutions due to the macroscopic thermal energy loss during collisional ionisation. In particular, the plasma temperature both post-shock and within the finite-width is significantly cooler that the post-shock MHD temperature. Furthermore, in the mid to lower chromosphere, shocks feature far greater compression then their single-fluid MHD analogues. The decreased temperature and increased compression reveal the importance of non-equilibrium ionised in the thermal evolution of shocks in partially ionised media. Since partially ionised shocks are not accurately described by the Rankine-Hugoniot shock jump conditions, it may be incorrect to use these to infer properties of lower atmospheric shocks.

 In this letter, we report the discovery of the highest redshift, heavily obscured, radio-loud QSO candidate selected using JWST NIRCam/MIRI, mid-IR, sub-mm, and radio imaging in the COSMOS-Web field. Using multi-frequency radio observations and mid-IR photometry, we identify a powerful, radio-loud (RL), growing supermassive black hole (SMBH) with significant spectral steepening of the radio SED ($f_{1.32 \mathrm{GHz}} \sim 2$ mJy, $q_{24\mu m} = -1.1$, $\alpha_{1.32-3\mathrm{GHz}}=-1.2$, $\Delta \alpha = -0.4$). In conjunction with ALMA, deep ground-based observations, ancillary space-based data, and the unprecedented resolution and sensitivity of JWST, we find no evidence of QSO contribution to the UV/optical/NIR data and thus infer heavy amounts of obscuration (N$_{\mathrm{H}} > 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$). Using the wealth of deep UV to sub-mm photometric data, we report a singular solution photo-z of $z_\mathrm{phot}$ = 7.65$^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ and estimate an extremely massive host-galaxy ($\log M_{\star} = 11.92 \pm 0.06\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$). This source represents the furthest known obscured RL QSO candidate, and its level of obscuration aligns with the most representative but observationally scarce population of QSOs at these epochs.

 Pre-stellar cores represent a critical evolutionary phase in low-mass star formation. We aim to unveil the detailed thermal structure and density distribution of three early-stage cores, starless core L1517B, and prestellar core L694-2 and L429, with the high angular resolution observations of the NH$_{3}$ (1,1) and (2,2) inversion transitions obtained with VLA and GBT. In addition, we explore where/if NH$_{3}$ depletes in the central regions. Applying the mid-infrared extinction method to the $\textit{Spitzer}$ 8$~\mu$m map we obtain a high angular resolution hydrogen column density map, and derive the gas density profile to assess the variation of NH$_{3}$ abundance as a function of gas volume density. The measured temperature profiles of L429 and L1517B show a minor decrease towards the core center, dropping from $\sim$9\~K to below 8\~K, and $\sim$11 K to 10 K, while L694-2 has a rather uniform temperature distribution around $\sim$9 K. Among the three cores, L429 has the highest central gas density, close to sonic velocity line-width, and largest localised velocity gradient, all indicative of an advanced evolutionary stage. We resolve that the abundance of NH$_{3}$ becomes two times lower in the central region of L429, occurring around a gas density of 4.4$\times$10$^{4}$$~cm^{-3}$. Compared to Ophiuchus/H-MM1 which shows an even stronger drop of the NH$_{3}$ abundance at 2$\times$10$^{5}$$~cm^{-3}$, the abundance variations of the three cores plus Ophiuchus/H-MM1 suggest a progressive NH$_{3}$ depletion with increasing central density of the core.

 In this paper, we study the properties of accretion flow including its spectral features in Johannsen and Psaltis (JP) non-Kerr spacetime. In doing so, we numerically solve the governing equations that describe the flow motion around the compact objects in a general relativistic framework, where spin ($a_{k}$) and deformation parameters ($\varepsilon$) demonstrate the nature of the central source, namely black hole (BH) or naked singularity (NS). With this, we obtain all possible classes of global accretion solutions ($i. e.$, O, A, W and I-type) by varying the energy ($E$) and angular momentum ($\lambda$) of the relativistic accretion flow, and examine the role of thermal bremsstrahlung emission in studying the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the accretion disc. We divide the parameter space in $\lambda-E$ plane in terms of the different classes of accretion solutions for BH and NS models. We further calculate the disc luminosity ($L$) corresponding to these accretion solutions, and observe that I-type solutions yield higher $L$ and SEDs than the remaining types of solutions for both BH and NS models. For BH model, SEDs for W and I-type solutions differ significantly from the results for O and A-type solutions for low $E$ values. On the contrary, for NS model, SEDs for different accretion solutions are identical in the whole parameter space of $\lambda$ and $E$. We also examine the effect of $\varepsilon$ on the SEDs and observe that a non-Kerr BH yields higher SEDs than the usual Kerr BH. Finally, for accretion solutions of identical $E$ and $\lambda$, we compare the SEDs obtained from BH and NS models, and find that naked singularity objects produce more luminous power spectra than the black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Photoevaporation from high energy stellar radiation has been thought to drive the dispersal of protoplanetary discs. Different theoretical models have been proposed, but their predictions diverge in terms of the rate and modality at which discs lose their mass, with significant implications for the formation and evolution of planets. In this paper we use disc population synthesis models to interpret recent observations of the lowest accreting protoplanetary discs, comparing predictions from EUV-driven, FUV-driven and X-ray driven photoevaporation models. We show that the recent observational data of stars with low accretion rates (low accretors) point to X-ray photoevaporation as the preferred mechanism driving the final stages of protoplanetary disc dispersal. We also show that the distribution of accretion rates predicted by the X-ray photoevaporation model is consistent with observations, while other dispersal models tested here are clearly ruled out.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous observations of dark vortices in Neptune's atmosphere, such as Voyager-2's Great Dark Spot, have been made in only a few, broad-wavelength channels, which has hampered efforts to pinpoint their pressure level and what makes them dark. Here, we present Very Large Telescope (Chile) MUSE spectrometer observations of Hubble Space Telescope's NDS-2018 dark spot, made in 2019. These medium-resolution 475 - 933 nm reflection spectra allow us to show that dark spots are caused by a darkening at short wavelengths (< 700 nm) of a deep ~5-bar aerosol layer, which we suggest is the H$_2$S condensation layer. A deep bright spot, named DBS-2019, is also visible on the edge of NDS-2018, whose spectral signature is consistent with a brightening of the same 5-bar layer at longer wavelengths (> 700 nm). This bright feature is much deeper than previously studied dark spot companion clouds and may be connected with the circulation that generates and sustains such spots.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulse profile modelling is a relativistic ray-tracing technique that can be used to infer masses, radii and geometric parameters of neutron stars. In a previous study, we looked at the performance of this technique when applied to thermonuclear burst oscillations from accreting neutron stars. That study showed that ignoring the variability associated with burst oscillation sources resulted in significant biases in the inferred mass and radius, particularly for the high count rates that are nominally required to obtain meaningful constraints. In this follow-on study, we show that the bias can be mitigated by slicing the bursts into shorter segments where variability can be neglected, and jointly fitting the segments. Using this approach, the systematic uncertainties on the mass and radius are brought within the range of the statistical uncertainty. With about 10$^6$ source counts, this yields uncertainties of approximately 10% for both the mass and radius. However, this modelling strategy requires substantial computational resources. We also confirm that the posterior distributions of the mass and radius obtained from multiple bursts of the same source can be merged to produce outcomes comparable to that of a single burst with an equivalent total number of counts.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries of gas giant exoplanets around M-dwarfs (GEMS) from transiting and radial velocity (RV) surveys are difficult to explain with core-accretion models. We present here a homogeneous suite of 162 models of gravitationally unstable gaseous disks. These models represent an existence proof for gas giants more massive than 0.1 Jupiter masses to form by the gas disk gravitational instability (GDGI) mechanism around M-dwarfs for comparison with observed exoplanet demographics and protoplanetary disk mass estimates for M-dwarf stars. We use the Enzo 2.6 adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) 3D hydrodynamics code to follow the formation and initial orbital evolution of gas giant protoplanets in gravitationally unstable gaseous disks in orbit around M-dwarfs with stellar masses ranging from 0.1 $M_\odot$ to 0.5 $M_\odot$. The gas disk masses are varied over a range from disks that are too low in mass to form gas giants rapidly to those where numerous gas giants are formed, therefore revealing the critical disk mass necessary for gas giants to form by the GDGI mechanism around M-dwarfs. The disk masses vary from 0.01 $M_\odot$ to 0.05 $M_\odot$ while the disk to star mass ratios explored range from 0.04 to 0.3. The models have varied initial outer disk temperatures (10 K to 60 K) and varied levels of AMR grid spatial resolution, producing a sample of expected gas giant protoplanets for each star mass. Broadly speaking, disk masses of at least 0.02 $M_\odot$ are needed for the GDGI mechanism to form gas giant protoplanets around M-dwarfs.
#### Tracing Dense Gas in Six Resolved GMCs of the Andromeda Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We present dense-gas--tracing molecular observations of six resolved Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). Using the NOEMA interferometer, we observed the transitions of HCN(1-0), HCO$^+$(1-0), and HNC(1-0), as well as $^{13}$CO(1-0) and 100 GHz continuum emission. This complements our earlier work with the Submillimeter Array (SMA), including resolved dust continuum detections of these clouds at 230 GHz. In this work, we first compare different continuum measurements to conclude that the average free-free contamination of the observed flux is 71% at 3 mm but only 13% at 1 mm, confirming that emission at 3 mm is less reliable than that at 1 mm for calculating dust masses of star-forming clouds. While the $^{13}$CO emission is more extended than both HCN and HCO$^+$ emission, which in turn is more extended than HNC emission, we find that both HCN and HCO$^+$ are spatially coincident with, and similarly extended as, the 230 GHz dust emission. This suggests that both the 230 GHz dust continuum and most importantly the HCN emission traces the dense gas component of these GMCs. From comparison of the molecular emission with dust masses derived from the 230 GHz continuum emission, we obtain the first direct measurements of the dust-mass-to-light ratios ($\alpha^\prime_{HCN}$ and $\alpha^\prime_{HCO^+}$) in GMCs of an external galaxy. For HCN, the result is broadly similar to a measurement in the local Perseus cloud suggesting that these are indeed dense gas conversion factors. A larger cloud sample will be required to assess whether HCN is tracing comparable cloud-scale density regimes across the environments of M31.

 - **Abstract**
 We observed the low-mass X-ray binary Sco X-1 for 12 nights simultaneously using the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer and the Otto Struve Telescope at McDonald Observatory at 1 second time resolution. This is among the most comprehensive simultaneous X-Ray/optical data sets of Sco X-1. Evidence of reprocessing was observed in the form of nine positive, near-zero lag peaks in the cross correlation function, eight of which were relatively small and took the shape of piecewise exponential functions. These peaks were initially identified by eye, after which a computational identification scheme was developed to confirm their significance. Based on their short lags (less than 4 seconds), as well as their occurrence on the flaring branch and soft apex, the small cross correlation features are likely to be caused by reprocessing off the outer disc, although the companion could still make a contribution to their tails. The Z track was parameterized using a rank number scheme so that the system's location on the track could be numerically defined. Plotting the results against the optical reveals an increasing step function when moving from the horizontal to the normal to the flaring branch, with differential optical levels at ~0.47, ~0.57, and ~1.1 respectively. An additional correlation between Z track location and the optical was found on the upper flaring branch. An optical intensity histogram reveals a transition region between the normal and flaring branches with only intermediate fluxes.
