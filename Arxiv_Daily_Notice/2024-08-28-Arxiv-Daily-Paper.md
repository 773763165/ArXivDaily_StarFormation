 - **Abstract**
 We present the first joint-likelihood analysis of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Bayesian inference is performed on the baryon abundance and the effective number of neutrino species, $N_{\rm eff}$, using a CMB Boltzmann solver in combination with LINX, a new flexible and efficient BBN code. We marginalize over Planck nuisance parameters and nuclear rates to find $N_{\rm{eff}} = 3.08_{-0.13}^{+0.13},\,2.94 _{-0.16}^{+0.16},$ or $2.98_{-0.13}^{+0.14}$, for three separate reaction networks. This framework enables robust testing of the Lambda Cold Dark Matter paradigm and its variants with CMB and BBN data.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive stars (SMSs) and heavy seed black holes, as their remnants, are promising candidates for Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) progenitors, especially for ones observed in the early universe $ z\simeq 8.5-10$ by recent JWST observations. Expected cradles of SMSs are the atomic cooling halos ($M_{\rm halo}\simeq 10^7~{\rm M_\odot}$), where "cold accretion" emerges and possibly forms SMSs. We perform a suit of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations and investigate star formation after the emergence of cold accretion, solving radiative feedback from stars inside the halo. We follow the mass growth of the protostars for $\sim 3~{\rm Myr}$, resolving the gas inflow down to $\sim 0.1~{\rm pc}$ scales. We discover that, after cold accretion emerges, multiple SMSs of $m_\star \gtrsim 10^5{\rm M_\odot}$ form at the halo centre with the accretion rates maintained at $\dot{m}_\star \simeq 0.04~{\rm M_\odot}~{\rm yr^{-1}}$ for $\lesssim 3~{\rm Myr}$. Cold accretion supplies gas at a rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm gas}\gtrsim 0.01-0.1~{\rm M_\odot}~{\rm yr^{-1}}$ from outside the halo virial radius to the central gas disc. Gravitational torques from spiral arms transport gas further inward, which feeds the SMSs. Radiative feedback from stars suppresses H$_2$ cooling and disc fragmentation, while photoevaporation is prevented by a dense envelope, which attenuates ionising radiation. Our results suggest that cold accretion can bring efficient BH mass growth after seed formation in the later universe. Moreover, cold accretion and gas migration inside the central disc increase the mass concentration and provide a promising formation site for the extremely compact stellar clusters observed by JWST.

          Confronting Cold New Early Dark Energy and its Equation of State with Updated CMB and Supernovae Data

 - **Abstract**
 Cold New Early Dark Energy (Cold NEDE) addresses the Hubble tension through a triggered vacuum phase transition in the dark sector. In this paper, we constrain a phenomenological fluid model using recent cosmic microwave background likelihoods based on Planck NPIPE data alongside baryonic acoustic oscillations and supernovae data from Pantheon+. Exploiting the enhanced constraining power of the datasets, we introduce and study an extended version of the NEDE fluid model in which the equation of state parameter $w_\mathrm{NEDE}$, characterizing the post-phase transition fluid, is allowed to evolve with non-vanishing derivatives ${d}w_\mathrm{NEDE}/d\ln a$ and ${d^2}w_\mathrm{NEDE}/{d}(\ln a)^2$. Our results indicate that data is compatible with a rather simple time dependence that could arise from a mixture of radiation and a stiff fluid. With the updated datasets, the base and extended models still show a significant reduction of the DMAP tension from $6.3 \sigma$ in $\Lambda$CDM down to $3.5\sigma$ with a small simultaneous reduction of the $S_8$ tension, slightly improving over recent findings for the axion-like early dark energy model.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce LINX (Light Isotope Nucleosynthesis with JAX), a new differentiable public Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) code designed for fast parameter estimation. By leveraging JAX, LINX achieves both speed and differentiability, enabling the use of Bayesian inference, including gradient-based methods. We discuss the formalism used in LINX for rapid primordial elemental abundance predictions and give examples of how LINX can be used. When combined with differentiable Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectrum emulators, LINX can be used for joint CMB and BBN analyses without requiring extensive computational resources, including on personal hardware.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio-frequency interference detection and flagging is one of the most difficult and urgent problems in 21 cm Epoch of Reionization research. In this work, we present $\chi^2$ from redundant calibration as a novel method for RFI detection and flagging, demonstrating it to be complementary to current state-of-the-art flagging algorithms. Beginning with a brief overview of redundant calibration and the meaning of the $\chi^2$ metric, we demonstrate a two-step RFI flagging algorithm which uses the values of this metric to detect faint RFI. We find that roughly 27.4\% of observations have RFI from digital television channel 7 detected by at least one algorithm of the three tested: 18.0\% of observations are flagged by the novel $\chi^2$ algorithm, 16.5\% are flagged by SSINS, and 6.8\% are flagged by AOFlagger (there is significant overlap in these percentages). Of the 27.4\% of observations with detected DTV channel 7 RFI, 37.1\% (10.2\% of the total observations) are detected by $\chi^2$ alone, and not by either SSINS or AOFlagger, demonstrating a significant population of as-yet undetected RFI. We find that $\chi^2$ is able to detect RFI events which remain undetectable to SSINS and AOFlagger, especially in the domain of long-duration, weak RFI from digital television. We also discuss the shortcomings of this approach, and discuss examples of RFI which seems undetectable using $\chi^2$ while being successfully flagged by SSINS and/or AOFlagger.

 - **Abstract**
 In spite of their key role in galaxy evolution and several decades of observational efforts, the census of supernova remnants (SNRs) in our Galaxy remains incomplete. Theoretical predictions based on the local supernova rate estimate the expected number of SNRs in the Galaxy to be $\gtrsim$ 1000. By contrast, the number of detected SNRs amounts to about 300. High-resolution, wide-area radio surveys at low frequencies are ideal tools with which to find missing SNRs, given the prominence of these sources at low radio frequencies. We aim to find missing SNRs using proprietary data from the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) at 144~MHz. We used LoTSS total intensity maps of two Galactic regions, one with $39^\mathrm{o} < l < 66^\mathrm{o}$ and $|b|< 2.5^\mathrm{o}$, and the other with $145^\mathrm{o} < l < 150^\mathrm{o}$ and $|b| < 3^\mathrm{o}$, in addition to mid-infrared (MIR) data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) all-sky survey to search for SNR candidates. We report the discovery of 14 new SNR candidates selected on the basis of their morphology at 144 MHz and a lack of MIR emission. We also follow up on 24 previously reported SNR candidates, inferring their spectral index between the LoTSS frequency (144 MHz) and the frequency at which they were reported. The high resolution and sensitivity of LoTSS observations has resulted in the detection of 14 new SNR candidates. In order to unambiguously confirm the SNR nature of these candidates, follow-up X-ray observations are required with facilities such as eROSITA.

          Europa's H$_2$O$_2$: Temperature Insensitivity and a Correlation with CO$_2$

 - **Abstract**
 H$_2$O$_2$ is part of Europa's water-ice radiolytic cycle and a potential source of oxidants to Europa's subsurface ocean. However, factors controlling the concentration of this critical surface species remain unclear. Though laboratory experiments suggest that Europa's H$_2$O$_2$ should be concentrated in the coldest, most ice-rich regions toward the poles, Keck adaptive optics observations have shown the strongest H$_2$O$_2$ signatures in comparatively warm, salt-bearing terrain at low latitudes. As a result, it was suggested that the local non-ice composition of these terrains -- particularly hypothesized enrichments of CO$_2$ -- may be a more dominant control on H$_2$O$_2$ than temperature or water-ice abundance. Here, we use observations of Europa from the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, Keck Observatory, and JWST to disentangle the potential effects of temperature and composition. In order to isolate the effect of temperature on Europa's H$_2$O$_2$, we use the ground-based observations to assess its response to temperature changes over timescales associated with Europa's daily eclipse and diurnal cycle. We use JWST Cycle 1 data to look for any geographic correlation between Europa's H$_2$O$_2$ and CO$_2$. Both changes in Europa's 3.5-$\mu$m H$_2$O$_2$ absorption band from pre to post eclipse and across a local day suggest minimal effects of the local temperature on these timescales. In contrast, the JWST observations show a strong positive correlation between Europa's H$_2$O$_2$ and CO$_2$ bands, supporting the previously suggested possibility that the presence of CO$_2$ in the ice may enhance H$_2$O$_2$ concentrations via electron-scavenging.

 - **Abstract**
 We present X-ray to radio frequency observations of the bright long gamma-ray burst GRB 210702A. Our ALMA 97.5 GHz observations show a significant rebrightening by a factor of ~2 beginning at 8.2 days post-burst and rising to peak brightness at 18.1 days before declining again. This is the first such rebrightening seen in a millimeter afterglow light curve. A standard forward shock model in a stellar wind circumburst medium can explain most of our X-ray, optical and millimeter observations prior to the rebrightening, but significantly over-predicts the self-absorbed radio emission, and cannot explain the millimeter rebrightening. We investigate possible explanations for the millimeter rebrightening and find that energy injection or a reverse shock from a late-time shell collision are plausible causes. Similar to other bursts, our radio data may require alternative scenarios such as a thermal electron population or a structured jet to explain the data. Our observations demonstrate that millimeter light curves can exhibit some of the rich features more commonly seen in optical and X-ray afterglow light curves, motivating further millimeter wavelength studies of GRB afterglows.

 - **Abstract**
 In the absence of laboratory data, state-of-the-art quantum chemical approaches can provide estimates on the binding energy (BE) of interstellar species with grains. Without BE values, contemporary astrochemical models are compelled to utilize wild guesses, often delivering misleading information. Here, we employ a fully quantum chemical approach to estimate the BE of 7 diatomic radicals - CH, NH, OH, SH, CN, NS, and NO, playing a crucial role in shaping the interstellar chemical composition, using a suitable amorphous solid water model as a substrate since water is the principal constituent of interstellar ice in dense and shielded regions. While the BEs are compatible with physisorption, the binding of CH in some sites shows chemisorption, in which a chemical bond to an oxygen atom of a water molecule is formed. While no structural change can be observed for the CN radical, it is believed that the formation of a hemibonded system between the outer layer of the water cluster and the radical is the reason for the unusually large BE in one of the binding sites considered in our study. A significantly lower BE for NO, consistent with recent calculations, is obtained, which is useful in explaining the recently observed HONO/NH2OH and HONO/HNO ratio in the low-mass hot corino, IRAS 16293-2422B, with chemical models.

 - **Abstract**
 Transiting giant exoplanets around M-dwarf stars (GEMS) are rare, owing to the low-mass host stars. However, the all-sky coverage of TESS has enabled the detection of an increasingly large number of them to enable statistical surveys like the \textit{Searching for GEMS} survey. As part of this endeavour, we describe the observations of six transiting giant planets, which includes precise mass measurements for two GEMS (K2-419Ab, TOI-6034b) and statistical validation for four systems, which includes validation and mass upper limits for three of them (TOI-5218b, TOI-5616b, TOI-5634Ab), while the fourth one -- TOI-5414b is classified as a `likely planet'. Our observations include radial velocities from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, and MAROON-X on Gemini-North, along with photometry and high-contrast imaging from multiple ground-based facilities. In addition to TESS photometry, K2-419Ab was also observed and statistically validated as part of the K2 mission in Campaigns 5 and 18, which provides precise orbital and planetary constraints despite the faint host star and long orbital period of $\sim 20.4$ days. With an equilibrium temperature of only 380 K, K2-419Ab is one of the coolest known well-characterized transiting planets. TOI-6034 has a late F-type companion about 40\arcsec~away, making it the first GEMS host star to have an earlier main-sequence binary companion. These confirmations add to the existing small sample of confirmed transiting GEMS.

          The impact of dark matter on tidal signatures in neutron star mergers with Einstein Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 If dark matter (DM) accumulates inside neutron stars (NS), it changes their internal structure and causes a shift of the tidal deformability from the value predicted by the dense-matter equation of state (EOS). In principle, this shift could be observable in the gravitational-wave (GW) signal of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. We investigate the effect of fermionic, non-interacting DM when observing a large number of GW events from DM-admixed BNSs with the precision of the proposed Einstein telescope (ET). Specifically, we study the impact on the recovery of the baryonic EOS and whether DM properties can be constrained. For this purpose, we create event catalogues of BNS mock events with DM fraction up to 1%, from which we reconstruct the posterior uncertainties with the Fisher matrix approach. Using this data, we perform joint Bayesian inference on the baryonic EOS, DM particle mass, and DM particle fraction in each event. Our results reveal that when falsely ignoring DM effects, the EOS posterior is biased towards softer EOSs, though the offset is rather small. Further, we find that within our assumptions of our DM model and population, ET will likely not be able to test the presence of DM in BNSs, even when combining many events and adding Cosmic Explorer (CE) to the next-generation detector network. Likewise, the potential constraints on the DM particle mass will remain weak because of degeneracies with the fraction and EOS.

          Energy-dependent intrinsic time delay of gamma-ray bursts on testing Lorentz invariance violation

 - **Abstract**
 High-energy photons of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) might be emitted at different intrinsic times with energy dependence at the source. In this letter, we expand the model from previous works on testing the Lorentz Invariance Violation (LV) with the observed GRB data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We reanalyze the previous data with the full Bayesian parameter estimation method and get consistent results by assuming that the time delays are due to an LV term and a constant intrinsic time delay term. Subsequently, we neglect the LV effect and only consider the intrinsic time delay effect. We assume a common intrinsic time delay term along with a source energy correlated time delay of high-energy photons. We find that the energy-dependent emission times can also explain the observed GRB data of high-energy photon events. Finally, we integrate these two physical mechanisms into a unified model to distinguish and evaluate their respective contributions using the observed GRB data.

          A synchronous moon as a possible cause of Mars' initial triaxiality
 - **Authors:** Michael Efroimsky
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 The paper addresses the possibility of a young Mars having had a massive moon, which synchronised the rotation of Mars, and gave Mars an initial asymmetric triaxiality to be later boosted by geological processes. It turns out that a moon of less than a third of the lunar mass was capable of producing a sufficient initial triaxiality. The asymmetry of the initial tidal shape of the equator depends on timing: the initial asymmetry is much stronger if the synchronous moon shows up already at the magma-ocean stage. From the moment of synchronisation of Mars' rotation with the moon's orbital motion, and until the moon was eliminated (as one possibility, by an impact in the beginning of the LHB), the moon was sustaining an early value of Mars' rotation rate.

 - **Abstract**
 Nanosatellites are proliferating as low-cost dedicated sensing systems with lean development cycles. Kyushu Institute of Technology and collaborators have launched a joint venture for a nanosatellite mission, VERTECS. The primary mission is to elucidate the formation history of stars by observing the optical-wavelength cosmic background radiation. The VERTECS satellite will be equipped with a small-aperture telescope and a high-precision attitude control system to capture the cosmic data for analysis on the ground. However, nanosatellites are limited by their onboard memory resources and downlink speed capabilities. Additionally, due to a limited number of ground stations, the satellite mission will face issues meeting the required data budget for mission success. To alleviate this issue, we propose an on-orbit system to autonomously classify and then compress desirable image data for data downlink prioritization and optimization. The system comprises a prototype Camera Controller Board (CCB) which carries a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 which is used for classification and compression. The system uses a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify and determine the desirability of captured image data. The model is designed to be lean and robust to reduce the computational and memory load on the satellite. The model is trained and tested on a novel star field dataset consisting of data captured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The dataset is meant to simulate the expected data produced by the 6U satellite. The compression step implements GZip, RICE or HCOMPRESS compression, which are standards for astronomical data. Preliminary testing on the proposed CNN model results in a classification accuracy of about 100\% on the star field dataset, with compression ratios of 3.99, 5.16 and 5.43 for GZip, RICE and HCOMPRESS that were achieved on tested FITS image data.

 - **Abstract**
 The POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) is a proposed payload to fly on a NASA Super Pressure Balloon (SPB). It will act as a pathfinder of the Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) detector. PBR will consist of an innovative hybrid focal surface featuring a Fluorescence Camera (FC, based on Multi-Anode Photomultiplier Tubes [MAPMTs], 1.05 $\mu$s time resolution) and a Cherenkov Camera (based on SiPMs, 10 ns time resolution), both mounted on the same tiltable frame that can point from nadir up to 13$^\circ$ above the horizon. The FC's main scientific goal is to observe, for the first time, the fluorescence emission of Extensive Air Showers produced by Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays from sub-orbital altitudes. This measurement will validate the detection strategy for future space-based missions, such as POEMMA. As a secondary goal, the FC will perform a search for macroscopic dark matter through slowly evolving showers that will leave a signal similar to (but distinct from) a meteor. PBR targets a launch in 2027 as a payload of an ultra-long duration balloon flight with a duration of up to 100 days.

 - **Abstract**
 We utilized a sample from the Fermi-LAT 14-year Source Catalog by adjusting the flux detection threshold, enabling us to derive the intrinsic source count distribution $dN/dF_{25}$ of extragalactic blazars using nonparametric, unbinned methods developed by Efron and Petrosian and Lynden-Bell. Subsequently, we evaluated the contribution of blazars to the extragalactic gamma-ray background. Our findings are summarized as follows: (1) There is no significant correlation between flux and spectral index values among blazars and their subclasses FSRQs and BL Lacs. (2) The intrinsic differential distributions of flux values exhibit a broken-power-law form, with parameters that closely match previous findings. The intrinsic photon index distributions are well described by a Gaussian form for FSRQs and BL Lacs individually, while a dual-Gaussian model provides a more appropriate fit for blazars as a whole. (3) Blazars contribute 34.5\% to the extragalactic gamma-ray background and 16.8\% to the extragalactic diffuse gamma-ray background. When examined separately, FSRQs and BL Lacs contribute 19.6\% and 13\% to the extragalactic gamma-ray background, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Preheating at the end of inflation is a violent nonlinear process that efficiently transfers the energy of the inflaton to a second field, the preheat field. When the preheat field is light during inflation and its background value modulates the preheating process, the superhorizon isocurvature perturbations of the preheat field may be converted to curvature perturbations that leave an imprint on the cosmic microwave background and the large-scale structure of the universe. We use high-precision lattice simulations to study kinetic preheating after $\alpha$-attractor inflation, a case where the effective mass of the preheat field is naturally suppressed during inflation. By comparing the expansion e-folds between different Hubble patches, we find that the conversion from isocurvature perturbations to curvature perturbations is very inefficient and can hardly be detected by cosmological observations.

          Stellar model tests and age determination for RGB stars from the APO-K2 catalogue

 - **Abstract**
 By adopting the recently empirically derived dependence of $\alpha$-elements on $[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]$ instead of the conventionally applied uniform one, we tested the agreement between stellar model predictions and observations for red giant branch (RGB) stars in the APO-K2 catalogue. We particularly focused on the biases in effective temperature scales and on the robustness of age estimations. We computed a grid of stellar models relying on the empirical scaling of $\alpha$-elements, investigating the offset in effective temperature $\Delta T$ between these models and observations, using univariate analyses for both metallicity [Fe/H] and $[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]$. To account for potential confounding factors, we then employed a multivariate generalised additive model to study the dependence of $\Delta T$ on [Fe/H], $[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]$, $\log g$, and stellar mass. The initial analysis revealed a negligible trend of $\Delta T$ with [Fe/H], in contrast with previous works in the literature. A slight $\Delta T$ difference of 25 K was detected between stars with high and low $\alpha$-enhancement. Our multivariate analysis reveals a dependence of $\Delta T$ on both [Fe/H] and $[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]$, and highlights a significant dependence on stellar mass. This suggests a discrepancy in how effective temperature scales with stellar mass in the models compared to observations. Despite differences in assumed chemical composition, our analysis, through a fortunate cancellation effect, yields ages that are largely consistent with recent studies of the same sample. Notably, our analysis identifies a 6% fraction of stars younger than 4 Ga within the high-$\alpha$ population. However, our analysis of the [C/N] ratio supports the possible origin of the these stars as a result of mergers or mass transfer events.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting mid-infrared (MIR) radiation has significant astronomical applications, although limited by unsatisfactory MIR detectors. Here we reported on the realization of a MIR up-conversion interferometer based on synthetic long base-line (SLBL) in the laboratory. The experimental system consisted of an interferometer and subsequent up-conversion detection part of mid-infrared signal, which streamlined the structure and enhanced the reliability of the system. By using a tungsten filament lamp as an imitated star, we not only achieved the single target angle resolution of 1.10 times 10^(-4) rad, but also obtained the field angle resolution of 3.0 times 10^(-4) rad of double star targets. The angular resolution is in inverse proportion to the length of baseline. The maximum length of simulated baseline in the laboratory is about 3cm. In a Keck Interferometer (KI) liked program, the base line can reach up to 85m leading to a corresponding angular resolution of 3.0 times 10^(-9) rad (about 1.8mas). The study will offer potential benefits in extending the usage of mid-infrared light in astronomical exploration.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of the continuum radiative transfer problem inside circumstellar envelopes is both a theoretical and numerical challenge, especially in the frequency-dependent and multi-dimensional case. While approximate methods are easier to handle numerically, they often fail to accurately describe the radiation field inside complex geometries. For these cases, it is necessary to directly solve numerically the radiative transfer equation. We investigate the accuracy of a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (DGFEM hereafter) applied to the frequency-dependent two dimensional radiative transfer equation, coupled with the radiative equilibrium equation, inside axis-symmetric circumstellar envelopes. The DGFEM is a variant of finite element methods. It employs discontinuous elements and flux integrals along their boundaries, ensuring local conservation. However, as opposed to the classical finite-element methods, the solution is discontinuous across element edges. We implemented the method in a code and tested its accuracy by comparing our results with the benchmarks from the literature. For all the tested cases, the temperature profile agrees within one percent. Additionally, the emerging spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and images, obtained subsequently by ray-tracing techniques from the DGFEM solution, agree on average within $5~\mathrm{\%}$ and $10~\mathrm{\%}$, respectively. We show that the DGFEM can accurately describe the temperature profile inside axis-symmetric circumstellar envelopes. Consecutively the emerging SEDs and images are also well reproduced. The discontinuous Galerkin finite element method provides an alternative method (other than Monte Carlo methods for instance) for solving the radiative transfer equation, and could be used in cases that are more difficult to handle with the other methods.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an overview of the operations and engineering interface for Planetary Radio Interferometry and Doppler Experiment (PRIDE) radio astronomy observations as a scientific component of the ESA s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) mission, as well as other prospective planetary and space science missions. The article discusses advanced scheduling and planning methods that make it possible to create observing schedules for observations of specific spacecraft in concurrence with observations of natural radio sources. In order to put this into practice and find suitable natural background calibrator sources for PRIDE of JUICE mission, we developed planning and scheduling software. The conventional scheduling software for natural celestial radio sources is not set up to include spacecraft as observation targets in the necessary control files. Therefore, difficulties already arise during observation planning. We report on the development of new and the adaptation of existing routines used in astrophysical and geodetic VLBI for satellite scheduling and planning. The analysis of the PRIDE science observations led to improved observational planning, and the mission s scheduling methodologies were studied using a systems engineering approach. In addition, we highlighted the new procedures, like finding charts for selecting calibrator radio sources over a range of frequency bands and the outcomes of those strategies for science operation planning. A simulation of the flyby of Venus during the cruise phase of the JUICE spacecraft, based on the Tudat software, is also presented, resulting in a promising opportunity to test PRIDE techniques and evaluate the improvements that PRIDE observables can make to natural bodies ephemerides.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the Chern-Simons term coupled to the inflaton in the Palatini formulation of general relativity. In contrast to the metric formulation, here the Chern-Simons term affects also the background evolution. We approximately solve for the connection, insert it back into the action, and reduce the order of the equations to obtain an effective theory in the gradient approximation. We consider three cases: when the connection is unconstrained, and when non-metricity or torsion is put to zero. In the first two cases, the inflaton kinetic term is modified with a term proportional to the square of the potential. For polynomial potentials dominated by the highest power of the field, the Chern-Simons term solves the problem that higher order corrections spoil the flatness of the potential. For Higgs inflation, the tensor-to-scalar ratio can as large as the current observational bound, and the non-minimal coupling to the Ricci scalar can be as small as in the metric case. The Palatini contribution cures the known instability of the tensor modes due the Chern-Simons term in the metric formulation.

 This special issue of the Astroparticle Physics journal is dedicated to the memory of Thomas Korff Gaisser, the Martin A. Pomerantz Professor Emeritus of Physics at the University of Delaware. Tom was one of the most prominent scientists in cosmic-ray and astroparticle physics, and also one of the founding editors of this very journal. A theoretical particle physicist by training, he dedicated his career to cosmic-ray physics. He worked on the phenomenology of high-energy particle interactions in the atmosphere, modeling extensive air showers, including the famous 'Gaisser-Hillas' function describing their longitudinal profile. A focus of his work were muon and neutrino fluxes resulting from cosmic-ray showers in the atmosphere, and their measurement with specialized experiments at the South Pole.

 - **Abstract**
 The physical trigger powering supernovae following the core collapse of massive stars is believed to involve a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH), depending largely on progenitor mass. A potentially distinct signature is a long-duration gravitational wave (GW) burst from BH central engines by their ample energy reservoir $E_J$ in angular momentum, far more so than an NS can provide. A natural catalyst for this radiation is surrounding high-density matter in the form of a non-axisymmetric disk or torus. Here, we derive a detailed outlook on LVK probes of core-collapse supernovae CC-SNe during the present observational run O4 based on their event rate, an association with normal long GRBs and mass-scaling of GW170817B/GRB170817A. For BH central engines of mass $M$, GW170817B predicts a descending GW-chirp of energy ${\cal E}_{GW}\simeq 3.5\% M_\odot c^2 \left(M/M_0\right)$ at frequency $f_{GW}\lesssim 700\,{\rm Hz}\left(M_0/M\right)$, where $M_0\simeq 2.8\,M_\odot$. For a few tens of events per year well into the Local Universe within 50-100Mpc, probes at the detector-limited sensitivity are expected to break the degeneracy between their NS or BH central engines {by GW calorimetry.

 - **Abstract**
 The vast majority of the orbital population today is unobservable and untracked because of their small size. These lethal non-trackable objects will only become more numerous as more payloads and debris are launched into orbit and increase the collision rate. In this paper, the long-term effect of collisions is simulated with an efficient Monte-Carlo method to simulate the future LEO environment including lethal non-trackable objects, which is typically ignored due to the large computational resources required. The results show that simulations that do not incorporate lethal non-trackable debris would be omitting a large number of debilitating collisions with active payloads and catastrophic collisions to a smaller effect. This shows the importance of simulating small debris in the long-term evolution of the orbital population, which is often omitted in the literature. This increased debris population and consequentially the risk to orbital payloads diminishes as smaller lethal non-trackable objects are considered. An efficient and validated model is used to simulate these numerous small objects. Several future cases such as launches of registered megaconstellations, improved post-mission disposal rates and no-future launches are explored to understand the effect of the inclusion or exclusion of lethal non-trackable objects.

 - **Abstract**
 We present FitTeD, a public light curve and spectral fitting Python-package based on evolving relativistic discs. At its heart this package uses the solutions of the time dependent general relativistic disc equations to compute multi-band light curves and spectra. All relevant relativistic optics effects (Doppler and gravitational energy shifting, and gravitational lensing) are included. Additional, non-disc light curve and spectral components can be included to (for example) model the early time rise and decay of tidal disruption event light curves in optical-to-UV bands. Monte Carlo Markov Chain fitting procedures are included which return posterior distributions of black hole and disc parameters, allowing for the future automated processing of the large populations of transient sources discovered by (e.g.,) the Vera Rubin Observatory. As an explicit example, in this paper we model the multi-wavelength light curves of the tidal disruption event AT2019dsg, finding a good fit to the data, a black hole mass consistent with galactic scaling relationships, and a late-time disc Eddington ratio consistent with the observed launching of an outflow observed in radio bands.

 - **Abstract**
 In the present study we employ three distinct physically motivated speed of sound bounds in order to construct hybrid models where the high density phase is described by the maximally stiff equation of state. In particular, we consider the bounds related to special relativity, relativistic kinetic theory and conformality. The low density hadronic phase is described by a state-of-the-art microscopic relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory. This work aims to access the effect of the different speed of sound constraints on the relevant parameter space of the key parameters of first-order phase transitions by utilising recent astronomical data. This involves a systematic analysis that also includes two distinct schemes for the construction of hybrid models, namely the Maxwell and Gibbs methods. Finally, a relevant discussion is conducted on the possible occurrence of a thermodynamic inconsistency that is related to the stability of the high density phase over hadronic matter at large densities.

 - **Abstract**
 Sixty years after the discovery of brown dwarfs, the search for these objects continues, particularly in the vicinity of the Sun. Objects near the Sun are characterized by large proper motions, making them seen as fast-moving objects. While the Gaia DR3 catalogue is a comprehensive source of proper motions, it lacks the depth needed for discovering fainter objects. Modern multi-epoch surveys, with their greater depth, offer a new opportunity for systematic search for ultra-cool dwarfs. The study aims to systematically search for high proper motion objects using the newly released catalogue of epochal WISE data in order to identify new brown dwarf candidates in the solar neighborhood, estimate their spectral types, distances and spatial velocities. We used recently released unTimely catalogue of epochal detections in unWISE coadds to search for objects with high proper motions using simple motion detection algorithm. This method was used to identify objects with proper motions exceeding approximately 0.6 arcseconds per year. The identified objects were then cross-referenced with data from other large-scale sky surveys to further analyze their characteristics. The search yielded 3245 moving objects with significant proper motions, 32 of which had not been previously published. Among these, at least 15 were identified as reliable new brown dwarf candidates, with estimated distances closer than 50 parsecs and spectral types later than T0.

 - **Abstract**
 A primary science goal for JWST is to detect and characterize the atmospheres of terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarfs (M-Earths). The existence of atmospheres on M-Earths is highly uncertain because their host stars' extended history of high XUV irradiation may act to completely remove their atmospheres. We present two JWST secondary eclipse observations of the M-Earth Gl 486b (also known as GJ 486b) between 5-12 $\mu$m. We combined these observations with a precise analysis of the host star parameters to derive a planetary dayside temperature of $T_{p}=865 \pm 14$ K. We compared this temperature to the maximum expected temperature for a zero albedo, zero heat redistribution bare rock and derived a temperature ratio of $R=\frac{T_{p,dayside}}{T_{p,max}}=0.97 \pm 0.01$. This value is consistent with an airless body with a slight non-zero albedo or a thin atmosphere with $<1$% H$_{2}$O or $<1$ ppm CO$_{2}$. However, it is inconsistent with an Earth- or Venus-like atmosphere, and the spectrum shows no clear emission or absorption features. Additionally, our observations are inconsistent with the water-rich atmospheric scenario allowed by previous transit observations and suggest the transmission spectrum was instead shaped by stellar contamination (Moran et al. 2023). Given the potential for atmospheric escape throughout the system's $\geq6.6$-Gyr lifetime (Diamond-Lowe et al. 2024), we conclude that the observations are likely best explained by an airless planet. This result is the most precise measurement yet of terrestrial exoplanet thermal emission with JWST, which places a strong constraint on the position of the "Cosmic Shoreline" between airless bodies and those with atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 The population of short-period giant exoplanets around M-dwarf stars is slowly rising. These planets present an extraordinary opportunity for atmospheric characterisation and defy our current understanding of planetary formation. Furthermore, clouds and hazes are ubiquitous in warm exoplanets but their behaviour is still poorly understood. We study the case of a standard warm Jupiter around a M-dwarf star to show the opportunity of this exoplanet population for atmospheric characterisation. We aim to derive the cloud, haze, and chemical budget of such planets using JWST. We leverage a 3D Global Climate Model, the generic PCM, to simulate the cloudy and cloud-free atmosphere of warm Jupiters around a M-dwarf. We then post-process our simulations to produce spectral phase curves and transit spectra as would be seen with JWST.We show that using the amplitude and offset of the spectral phase curves, we can directly infer the presence of clouds and hazes in the atmosphere of such giant planets. Chemical characterisation of multiple species is possible with an unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio, using the transit spectrum in one single visit. In such atmospheres, NH3 could be detected for the first time in a giant exoplanet. We make the case that these planets are key to understanding the cloud and haze budget in warm giants. Finally, such planets are targets of great interest for Ariel.

 - **Abstract**
 With ongoing advancements in nuclear theory and experimentation, together with a growing body of neutron star (NS) observations, a wealth of information on the equation of state (EOS) for matter at extreme densities has become accessible. Here, we utilize a hybrid EOS formulation that combines an empirical parameterization centered around the nuclear saturation density with a generic three-segment piecewise polytrope model at higher densities. We incorporate data derived from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT), perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), and from experiments such as PREX-II and CREX. Furthermore, we examine the influence of a total of 129 NS mass measurements up to April 2023, as well as simultaneous mass and radius measurements derived from the X-ray emission from surface hot spots on NSs. Additionally, we consider constraints on tidal properties inferred from the gravitational waves emitted by coalescing NS binaries. To integrate this extensive and varied array of constraints, we utilize a hierarchical Bayesian statistical framework to simultaneously deduce the EOS and the distribution of NS masses. We find that incorporating data from $\chi$EFT significantly tightens the constraints on the EOS of NSs near or below the nuclear saturation density. However, constraints derived from pQCD computations and nuclear experiments such as PREX-II and CREX have minimal impact.

 - **Abstract**
 We present deep, wideband multifrequency radio observations (144 MHz$-$8 GHz) of the remarkable galaxy group NGC 741, which yield crucial insights into the interaction between the infalling head-tail radio galaxy (NGC 742) and the main group. Our new data provide an unprecedentedly detailed view of the NGC 741-742 system, including the shock cone, disrupted jets from NGC 742, the long ($\sim$ 255 kpc) braided southern radio tail, and eastern lobe-like structure, and reveal, for the first time, complex radio filaments throughout the tail and lobe, and a likely vortex ring behind the shock cone. The cone traces the bow shock caused by the supersonic ($\mathcal{M}\sim2$) interaction between the head-tail radio galaxy NGC 742 and the intragroup medium (IGrM) while the ring may have been formed by interaction between the NGC 742 shock and a previously existing lobe associated with NGC 741. This interaction plausibly compressed and re-accelerated the radio plasma. We estimate that shock-heating by NGC 742 has likely injected $\sim$2-5$\times$10$^{57}$ erg of thermal energy into the central 10 kpc cooling region of the IGrM, potentially affecting the cooling and feedback cycle of NGC 741. A comparison with Chandra X-ray images shows that some of the previously detected thermal filaments align with radio edges, suggesting compression of the IGrM as the relativistic plasma of the NGC 742 tail interacts with the surrounding medium. Our results highlight that multi-frequency observations are key to disentangling the complex, intertwined origins of the variety of radio features seen in the galaxy group NGC 741, and the need for simulations to reproduce all the detected features.
