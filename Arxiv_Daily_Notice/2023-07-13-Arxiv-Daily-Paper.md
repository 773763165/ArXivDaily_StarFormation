 - **Abstract**
 Light emission in the first hours and days following core-collapse supernovae is dominated by the escape of photons from the expanding shock heated envelope. In a preceding paper, Paper I, we provided a simple analytic description of the time dependent luminosity, $L$, and color temperature, $T_{\rm col}$, for explosions of red supergiants with convective polytropic envelopes and in the absence of significant circum-stellar medium. It is valid up to H recombination ($T\approx0.7$~eV). The analytic description was calibrated against the results of numerical calculations, approximating radiation transport by diffusion with a "gray" (frequency independent) opacity. Here we present the results of a large set of 1-dimensional numeric multi-group (frequency dependent) photon diffusion calculations, for a wide range of progenitor parameters (mass, radius, core/envelope mass and radius ratios, metalicity) and explosion energies, using opacity tables that we have constructed for this purpose (and are publicly available) including the contributions of bound-bound and bound-free transitions. We provide an analytic description of the small, $\simeq10\%$ deviations of the spectrum from blackbody at low frequencies, $h\nu < 3T_{\rm col}$, and an improved (over Paper I) analytic description of the strong suppression of the flux due to line absorption at high frequencies, $h\nu> 3T_{\rm col}$. We show that the effects of deviations from ionization and excitation LTE and of `expansion opacity' corrections are small, and that the effect of deviations from a polytropic density distribution are also small. Our analytic results are a useful tool for inferring progenitor properties, explosion velocity, and also relative extinction based on early multi-band shock cooling observations of supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 Japan Astrometry Satellite Mission for INfrared Exploration (JASMINE) is a planned M-class science space mission by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. JASMINE has two main science goals. One is Galactic archaeology with Galactic Center Survey, which aims to reveal the Milky Way's central core structure and formation history from Gaia-level (~25 $\mu$as) astrometry in the Near-Infrared (NIR) Hw-band (1.0-1.6 $\mu$m). The other is the Exoplanet Survey, which aims to discover transiting Earth-like exoplanets in the habitable zone from the NIR time-series photometry of M dwarfs, when the Galactic center is not accessible. We introduce the mission, review many science objectives and present the instrument concept. JASMINE will be the first dedicated NIR astrometry space mission and provide precise astrometric information of the stars in the Galactic center, taking advantage of the significantly lower extinction in the NIR band. The precise astrometry is obtained by taking many short-exposure images. Hence, the JASMINE Galactic center survey data will be valuable for studies of exoplanet transits, asteroseismology, variable stars and microlensing studies, including discovery of (intermediate mass) black holes. We highlight a swath of such potential science, and also describe synergies with other missions.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of the Magellanic Bridge during an encounter between the Magellanic Clouds $\sim$200 Myr ago would be imprinted in the chemical evolution and kinematics of its stellar population, with sites of active star formation. Since it contains hundreds of stellar clusters and associations, we combined deep photometry from VISCACHA and SMASH surveys to explore this topic, by deriving structural parameters, age, metallicity, distance and mass for 33 Bridge clusters with robust statistical tools. We identified a group of 13 clusters probably stripped from the Small Magellanic Cloud (0.5$-$6.8 Gyr, $\rm{[Fe/H]} < -0.6$ dex) and another 15 probably formed in-situ ($<$200 Myr, $\rm{[Fe/H]}\sim-0.4$ dex). Two metallicity dips were detected in the age-metallicity relation, coeval to the Stream and Bridge formation epochs. Cluster masses range from 500 to $\sim 10^4 M_\odot$, and a new estimate of $3-5\times 10^5 M_\odot$ is obtained for the Bridge stellar mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Data-driven models of stellar spectra are useful tools to study non-stellar information, such as the Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs) caused by intervening gas and dust. Using $\sim55000$ spectra of $\sim17000$ red clump stars from the APOGEE DR16 dataset, we create 2nd order polynomial models of the continuum-normalized flux as a function of stellar parameters ($T_{eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], [$\alpha$/Fe], and age). The model and data show good agreement within uncertainties across the APOGEE wavelength range, although many regions reveal residuals that are not in the stellar rest-frame. We show that many of these residual features -- having average extrema at the level of $\sim3\%$ in stellar flux on average -- can be attributed to incompletely-removed spectral lines from the Earth's atmosphere and DIBs from the interstellar medium (ISM). After removing most of the remaining contamination from the Earth's sky, we identify 84 (25) absorption features that have less than a 50% (5%) probability of being explained by chance alone, including all 10 previously-known DIBs in the APOGEE wavelength range. Because many of these features occur in the wavelength windows that APOGEE uses to measure chemical abundances, characterization and removal of this non-stellar contamination is an important step in reaching the precision required for chemical tagging experiments. Proper characterization of these features will benefit Galactic ISM science and the currently-ongoing Milky Way Mapper program of SDSS-V, which relies on the APOGEE spectrograph.
#### A sub-Saturn Mass-Radius Desert for Planets with Equilibrium Temperature  Less than 600 K

 - **Abstract**
 The sample of exoplanets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive with equilibrium temperature less than 600 K and with low uncertainty for both mass and radius measurements is found to have a desert in the mass-radius distribution consistent with predictions from the core-accretion scenario. This sub-Saturn mass-radius desert is almost completely barren of any planets with both a mass greater than 20 Earth masses and a radius in the range 4.0 to 7.5 Earth radii for the sample of planets with equilibrium temperature less than 600 K. In contrast, the sample of planets with equilibrium temperature greater than 630 K includes a large fraction of planets with mass-radius values that fall into the less than 600 K sub-Saturn mass-radius desert. The difference between the two populations may result from differences in migration history in the core-accretion scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) has been proposed as an alternative to the standard collisionless cold dark matter to explain the diversity of galactic rotation curves and core-cusp problems seen at small scales. Here, we estimate the constraints on SIDM for a sample of 11 relaxed galaxy groups with X-ray observations from Chandra and XMM-Newton. We fit the dark matter density distribution to the Einasto profile and use the estimated Einasto $\alpha$ parameter to constrain the SIDM cross-section, based on the empirical relation between the two, which was obtained in Eckert et al (2022). We obtain a non-zero central estimate for the cross-section per unit mass ($\sigma/m$) for seven groups, with the most precise estimate obtained for NGC 5044, given by $\sigma/m=0.165 \pm 0.025~\rm{cm^2/g}$, for dark matter velocity dispersion of about 300 km/sec. For the remaining four groups, we obtain 95% c.l. upper limits on $\sigma/m < 0.16-6.61~\rm{cm^2/g}$ with dark matter velocity dispersions between 200-500 km/sec, with the most stringent limit for our sample obtained for the group MKW 4, given by $\sigma/m< 0.16~\rm{cm^2/g}$ for dark matter velocity dispersion of about 350 km/sec.

 - **Abstract**
 The actinides, such as the uranium (U) element, are typically synthesized through the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process), which can occur in core-collapse supernovae or double neutron star mergers. There exist nine r-process giant stars exhibiting conspicuousUabundances, commonly referred to as U-rich giants. However, the origins of these U-rich giants remain ambiguous. We propose an alternative formation scenario for these U-rich giants whereby a red giant (RG) engulfs an Earth-like planet. To approximate the process of a RG engulfing an Earth-like planet, we employ an accretion model wherein the RG assimilates materials from said planet. Our findings demonstrate that this engulfment event can considerably enhance the presence of heavy elements originating from Earth-like planets on the surfaces of very metal-poor stars (Z = 0.00001), while its impact on solar-metallicity stars is comparatively modest. Importantly, the structural and evolutionary properties of both very metalpoor and solar-metallicity stars remain largely unaffected. Notably, our engulfment model effectively accounts for the observed U abundances in known U-rich giants. Furthermore, the evolutionary trajectories of U abundances on the surfaces of RGs subsequent to the engulfment of Earth-like planets encompass all known U-rich giants. Therefore, it is plausible that U-rich giants are formed when a RG engulfs an Earth-like planet.

 - **Abstract**
 Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2) is a giant molecular cloud complex in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy hosting several sites of high-mass star formation. The two main centers of activity are Sgr B2(M) and Sgr B2(N), which contain 27 and 20 continuum sources, respectively. Our analysis aims to be a comprehensive modeling of each core spectrum, where we take the complex interaction between molecular lines, dust attenuation, and free-free emission arising from HII regions into account. In this work, we determine the dust and, if HII regions are contained, the parameters of the free-free thermal emission of the ionized gas for each core, and derive a self-consistent description of the continuum levels of each core. Using the high sensitivity of ALMA, we characterize the physical and chemical structure of these continuum sources and gain better insight into the star formation process within the cores. We used ALMA to perform an unbiased spectral line survey of all 47 sources in ALMA band 6 with a frequency coverage from 211 GHz to 275 GHz. In order to model the free-free continuum contribution of a specific core, we fit the contained recombination lines (RRLs) to obtain the electron temperatures and the emission measures, where we use an extended XCLASS program to describe RRLs and free-free continuum simultaneously. In contrast to previous analyses, we derived the corresponding parameters here not only for each core, but also for their local surrounding envelope, and determined their physical properties. The distribution of RRLs we found in the core spectra closely fits the distribution of HII regions described in previous analyses. For the cores we determine average dust temperatures of around 236 K (Sgr B2(M)) and 225 K (Sgr B2(N)), while the electronic temperatures are located in a range between 3800 K and 23800 K.
#### The Spatial and Emission Properties of the Large [O III] Emission Nebula  Near M31

 - **Abstract**
 Drechsler et al. (2023) reported the unexpected discovery of a 1.5 degree long [O III] emission nebula 1.2 degrees southeast of the M31 nucleus. Here we present additional images of this large emission structure, called SDSO, along with radial velocity and flux measurements from low-dispersion spectra. Independent sets of [O III] images show SDSO to be composed of broad streaks of diffuse emission aligned NE-SW. Deep H$\alpha$ images reveal no strong coincident emission suggesting a high [O III]/H$\alpha$ ratio. We also find no other [O III] emission nebulosity as bright as SDSO within several degrees of M31 and no filamentary H$\alpha$ emission connected to SDSO. Optical spectra taken along the arc's northern limb reveal [O III] $\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 emissions matching the location and extent seen in our [O III] images. The heliocentric velocity of this [O III] nebulosity is $-9.8 \pm 6.8$ km s$^{-1}$ with a peak surface brightness of $(4\pm2) \times 10^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ ($\sim$0.55 Rayleigh). We discuss SDSO as a possible unrecognized supernova remnant, a large and unusually nearby planetary nebula, a stellar bow shock nebula, or an interaction of M31's outer halo gas with high-velocity circumgalactic gas. We conclude that galactic origins for SDSO are unlikely and favor instead an extragalactic M31 halo--circumgalactic cloud interaction scenario, despite the nebula's low radial velocity. We then describe new observations that may help resolve the true nature and origin of this large nebulosity so close to M31 in the sky.
