#### Exploring the nature of dark matter with the extreme galaxy AGC 114905

 - **Abstract**
 AGC 114905 is a dwarf gas-rich ultra-diffuse galaxy seemingly in tension with the cold dark matter (CDM) model. Specifically, the galaxy appears to have an extremely low-density halo and a high baryon fraction, while CDM predicts dwarfs to have very dense and dominant dark haloes. The alleged tension relies on the galaxy's rotation curve decomposition, which depends heavily on its inclination. This inclination, estimated from the gas morphology, remains somewhat uncertain. We present unmatched ultra-deep optical imaging of AGC 114905 reaching surface brightness limits $\mu_{\rm r,lim} \approx 32$ mag/arcsec$^2$ ($3\sigma$; 10 arcsec $\times$ 10 arcsec) obtained with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. With the new imaging, we characterise the galaxy's morphology, surface brightness, colours, and stellar mass profiles in great detail. The stellar disc has a similar extent as the gas, presents spiral arms-like features, and shows a well-defined edge. Stars and gas share similar morphology, and crucially, we find an inclination of $31\pm2^\circ$, in agreement with the previous determinations. We revisit the rotation curve decomposition of the galaxy, and we explore different mass models in the context of CDM, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), fuzzy dark matter (FDM) or Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). We find that the latter does not fit the circular speed of the galaxy, while CDM only does so with dark halo parameters rarely seen in cosmological simulations. Within the uncertainties, SIDM and FDM remain feasible candidates to explain the observed kinematics of AGC 114905.

 - **Abstract**
 The exact sources of high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory still remain a mystery. For the first time, this work explores the hypothesis that galaxy mergers may serve as sources for these high-energy neutrinos. Galaxy mergers can host very high-energy hadronic and photohadronic processes, which may produce very high-energy neutrinos. We perform an unbinned maximum-likelihood-ratio analysis utilizing the galaxy merger data from six catalogs and 10 years of public IceCube muon-track data to quantify any correlation between these mergers and neutrino events. First, we perform the single source search analysis, which reveals that none of the considered galaxy mergers exhibit a statistically significant correlation with high-energy neutrino events detected by IceCube. Furthermore, we conduct a stacking analysis with three different weighting schemes to understand if these galaxy mergers can contribute significantly to the diffuse flux of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos detected by IceCube. We find that upper limits (at $95\%$ c.l.) of the all flavour high-energy neutrino flux, associated with galaxy mergers considered in this study, at $100$ TeV with spectral index $\Gamma=-2$ are $2.57\times 10^{-18}$, $8.51 \times 10^{-19}$ and $2.36 \times 10^{-18}$ $\rm GeV^{-1}\,cm^2\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}$ for the three weighting schemes. This work shows that these selected galaxy mergers do not contribute significantly to the IceCube detected high energy neutrino flux. We hope that in the near future with more data, the search for neutrinos from galaxy mergers can either discover their neutrino production or impose more stringent constraints on the production mechanism of high-energy neutrinos within galaxy mergers.
#### Searching for Triple Systems Unbound by Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 A large fraction of massive stars are found in higher order systems where the presence of a tertiary may significantly modify the system's evolution. In particular, it can lead to increased numbers of compact object binaries and accelerate their mergers with important implications for gravitational wave observations. Using Gaia, we constrain the number of Galactic supernovae that produce unbound triples. We do this by searching 8 supernova remnants for stars with consistent Gaia parallaxes and paths intersecting near the center of the supernova remnant at a time consistent with the age of the remnant. We find no candidates for unbound triple systems. Combined with prior work, less than 11.4\% of supernovae leave behind unbound triples at a 90\% confidence limit. The absence of such systems limits their role in the evolution of massive stars and the formation of merging compact objects.
#### Reconstructing Primordial Black Hole Power Spectra from Gravitational  Waves

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06547
 - **Abstract**
 A novel methodology for analysing the relation between the energy density in gravitational waves and primordial power spectra is developed. Focusing on scalar-induced gravitational radiation, this methodology is applied to a number of scenarios for the primordial black hole formation. Being differed from conventional Bayesian approaches, its advantages include directness and computational efficiency, which are crucial for handling the complex data characteristic of gravitational wave research. As an important application, it is demonstrated that it allows to systematically identify all scenarios consistent with current and future pulsar-timing-array data.
#### Late-end reionization with ATON-HE: towards constraints from  Lyman-$α$ emitters observed with JWST

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new suite of late-end reionization simulations performed with ATON-HE, a revised version of the GPU-based radiative transfer code ATON that includes helium. The simulations are able to reproduce the Ly$\alpha$ flux distribution of the E-XQR-30 sample of QSO absorption spectra at $5 \lesssim z \lesssim 6.2$, and show that a large variety of reionization models are consistent with these data. We explore a range of variations in source models and in the early-stage evolution of reionization. Our fiducial reionization history has a midpoint of reionization at $z = 6.5$, but we also explore an `Early' reionization history with a midpoint at $z = 7.5$ and an `Extremely Early' reionization history with a midpoint at $z = 9.5$. Haloes massive enough to host observed Ly$\alpha$ emitters are highly biased. The fraction of such haloes embedded in ionized bubbles that are large enough to allow high Ly$\alpha$ transmission becomes close to unity much before the volume filling factor of ionized regions. For our fiducial reionization history this happens at $z = 8$, probably too late to be consistent with the detection by JWST of abundant Ly$\alpha$ emission out to $z = 11$. A reionization history in our `Early' model or perhaps even our `Extremely Early' model may be required, suggesting a Thomson scattering optical depth in tension with that reported by Planck, but consistent with recent suggestions of a significantly higher value.
#### Atmospheric characterisation and tighter constraints on the orbital  misalignment of WASP-94 A b with HARPS

 - **Abstract**
 We present high spectral resolution observations of the hot Jupiter WASP-94 A b using the HARPS instrument on ESO's 3.6m telescope in La Silla, Chile. We probed for Na absorption in its atmosphere as well as constrained the previously reported misaligned retrograde orbit using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. Additionally, we undertook a combined atmospheric retrieval analysis with previously published low-resolution data. We confirm the retrograde orbit as well as constrain the orbital misalignment with our measurement of a projected spin-orbit obliquity of $\lambda = 123.0 \pm 3.0 ^\circ$. We find a tentative detection of Na absorption in the atmosphere of WASP-94 A b, independent of the treatment of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect in our analysis (3.6$\sigma$ and 4.4$\sigma$). We combine our HARPS high resolution data with low resolution data from the literature and find that while the posterior distribution of the Na abundance results in a tighter constraint than using a single data set, the detection significance does not improve (3.2$\sigma$), which we attribute to degeneracies between the low and high resolution data.
#### PSF quality metrics in the problem of revealing Intermediate-Mass Black  Holes using MICADO@ELT

 - **Abstract**
 Nowadays, astronomers perform point spread function (PSF) fitting for most types of observational data. Interpolation of the PSF is often an intermediate step in such algorithms. In the case of the Multi-AO Imaging Camera for Deep Observations (MICADO) at the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), PSF interpolation will play a crucial role in high-precision astrometry for stellar clusters and confirmation of the Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBHs) presence. Significant PSF variations across the field of view invalidate the approach of deconvolution with a mean PSF or on-axis PSF. The ignoring of PSF variations can be especially unsatisfactory in the case of Single Conjugate Adaptive Optics (SCAO) observations, as these sophisticated and expensive systems are designed to achieve high resolution with ground-based telescopes by correcting for atmospheric turbulence in the direction of one reference star. In plenty of tasks, you face the question: How can I establish the quality of PSF fitting or interpolation? Our study aims to demonstrate the variety of PSF quality metrics, including the problem of revealing IMBHs in stellar clusters.
#### Differences between Stable and Unstable Architectures of Compact  Planetary Systems

 - **Abstract**
 We present a stability analysis of a large set of simulated planetary systems of three or more planets based on architectures of multiplanet systems discovered by \textit{Kepler} and \textit{K2}. We propagated 21,400 simulated planetary systems up to 5 billion orbits of the innermost planet; approximately 13% of these simulations ended in a planet-planet collision within that timespan. We examined trends in dynamical stability based on dynamical spacings, orbital period ratios, and mass ratios of nearest-neighbor planets as well as the system-wide planet mass distribution and the spectral fraction describing the system's short-term evolution. We find that instability is more likely in planetary systems with adjacent planet pairs that have period ratios less than two and in systems of greater variance of planet masses. Systems with planet pairs at very small dynamical spacings (less than $\sim10-12$ mutual Hill radius) are also prone to instabilities, but instabilities also occur at much larger planetary separations. We find that a large spectral fraction (calculated from short integrations) is a reasonable predictor of longer-term dynamical instability; systems that have a large number of Fourier components in their eccentricity vectors are prone to secular chaos and subsequent eccentricity growth and instabilities.
#### Deriving X-ray Line Profiles for Massive-Star Winds from  Momentum-Conserving Dynamical Working Surface Solutions

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06590
 - **Abstract**
 We present a general procedure for deriving a line profile model for massive star X-ray spectra that captures the dynamics of the wind more directly. The basis of the model is the analytic solution to the problem of variable jets in Herbig-Haro objects given by \citet{Canto2000}. In deriving our model, we generalize this jet solution to include flows with a prescribed nonzero acceleration for the context of radiatively driven winds. We provide example line profiles generated from our model for the case of sinusoidal velocity and mass ejection variations. The example profiles show the expected shape of massive star X-ray emission lines, as well as interesting but complicated trends with the model parameters. This establishes the possibility that observed X-rays could be a result of temporal variations seeded at the wind base, rather than purely generated intrinsically within the wind volume, and can be described via a quantitative language that connects with the physical attributes of those variations, consistently with the downstream momentum-conserving nature of radiatively cooled shocked radial flows.
#### Constraints on atmospheric water abundance and cloud deck pressure in  the warm Neptune GJ 3470 b via CARMENES transmission spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of cooler atmospheres of super-Earths and Neptune sized objects often show flat transmission spectra. The most likely cause of this trend is the presence of aerosols (i.e. clouds and hazes) in the atmospheres of such objects. High-resolution spectroscopy provides an opportunity to test this hypothesis by targeting molecular species whose spectral line cores extend above the level of such opaque decks. In this work, we analyse high-resolution infrared observations of the warm Neptune GJ 3470 b taken over two transits using CARMENES (R $\sim$ 80,000) and look for signatures of H$_2$O (previously detected using HST WFC3+Spitzer observations) in these transits with a custom pipeline fully accounting for the effects of data cleaning on any potential exoplanet signal. We find that our data are potentially able to weakly detect ($\sim3\sigma$) an injected signal equivalent to the best-fit model from previous HST WFC3+Spitzer observations. However, we do not make a significant detection using the actual observations. Using a Bayesian framework to simultaneously constrain the H$_2$O Volume Mixing Ratio (VMR) and the cloud top pressure level, we select a family of models compatible with the non detection. These are either very high VMR, cloud-free models, solar-abundance models with a high cloud deck, or sub-solar abundance models with a moderate cloud deck. This is a broader range compared to published results from low-resolution spectroscopy, but is also compatible with them at a 1$\sigma$ level.

 - **Abstract**
 The DESI year one observations can help probe new physics on cosmological scales. In light of the latest DESI BAO measurements, we constrain four popular cosmological scenarios including inflation, modified gravity, annihilating dark matter and interacting dark energy. Using a data combination of BICEP/Keck array, cosmic microwave background and DESI, we obtain the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_{0.05}= 0.0176^{+0.0070}_{-0.0130}$ and $r_{0.05}=0.018^{+0.020}_{-0.017}$. Using the combination of cosmic microwave background and DESI, we find a $2.4\sigma$ evidence for gravitational theories beyond the general relativity, shrinks the dark matter annihilation cross-section by $12\%$ relative to cosmic microwave background, and obtain a $1.6\sigma$ hint of the positive interaction between dark matter and dark energy indicating that energy may be transferred from dark matter to dark energy in the dark sector of the universe. Future DESI observations could go a step further to explore the nature of inflation, dark matter and dark energy, and test the validity of general relativity on cosmological scales.
#### Probing the shape of the brown dwarf desert around main-sequence  A-F-G-type stars using post-common-envelope WD$-$BD binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs (BDs) possessing masses within the range $40-60 M_{\rm Jup}$ are rare around solar-type main-sequence (MS) stars, which gives rise to the brown dwarf desert (BDD). One caveat associated with previous studies of BDD is the relatively limited sample size of MS$-$BD binaries with accurately determined BD masses. We aim to produce a large sample of brown dwarf companions with precisely determined mass around main-sequence A-F-G type stars using observations of post common-envelope white dwarf (WD)$-$BD binaries. We employ the rapid binary evolution code COMPAS to deduce the properties of MS$-$BD binary progenitors from post common-envelope WD$-$BD binaries. This method supplements the directly observed MS$-$BD binary sample, enriching the data available for analyzing BDD around main-sequence A-F-G type stars. Our study opens a new window for studying the shape of BDD around A-F-G type main-sequence stars in the short period regime. We find tentative evidence that the `driest' part of BDD around A-F-G type stars may extend into an orbital period of several hundred days, albeit with a small sample size. More post common-envelope WD$-$BD binaries detected in the future will advance our understanding of the BDD around A-F-G type stars.
#### Hydrodynamic simulations of WD-WD mergers and the origin of RCB stars

 - **Abstract**
 We study the properties of double white dwarf (DWD) mergers by performing hydrodynamic simulations using the new and improved adaptive mesh refinement code Octo-Tiger. We follow the orbital evolution of DWD systems of mass ratio q=0.7 for tens of orbits until and after the merger to investigate them as a possible origin for R Coronae Borealis (RCB) type stars. We reproduce previous results, finding that during the merger, the Helium WD donor star is tidally disrupted within 20-80 minutes since the beginning of the simulation onto the accretor Carbon-Oxygen WD, creating a high temperature shell around the accretor. We investigate the possible Helium burning in this shell and the merged object's general structure. Specifically, we are interested in the amount of Oxygen-16 dredged-up to the hot shell and the amount of Oxygen-18 produced. This is critical as the discovery of very low Oxygen-16 to Oxygen-18 ratios in RCB stars pointed out the merger scenario as a favorable explanation for their origin. A small amount of hydrogen in the donor may help keep the Oxygen-16 to Oxygen-18 ratios within observational bounds, even if moderate dredge-up from the accretor occurs. In addition, we perform a resolution study to reconcile the difference found in the amount of Oxygen-16 dredge-up between smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and grid-based simulations.
#### PROJECT-J: JWST observations of HH46~IRS and its outflow. Overview and  first results

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first results of the JWST program PROJECT-J (PROtostellar JEts Cradle Tested with JWST ), designed to study the Class I source HH46 IRS and its outflow through NIRSpec and MIRI spectroscopy (1.66 to 28 micron). The data provide line-images (~ 6.6" in length with NIRSpec, and up to 20" with MIRI) revealing unprecedented details within the jet, the molecular outflow and the cavity. We detect, for the first time, the red-shifted jet within ~ 90 au from the source. Dozens of shock-excited forbidden lines are observed, including highly ionized species such as [Ne III] 15.5 micron, suggesting that the gas is excited by high velocity (> 80 km/s) shocks in a relatively high density medium. Images of H2 lines at different excitations outline a complex molecular flow, where a bright cavity, molecular shells, and a jet-driven bow-shock interact with and are shaped by the ambient conditions. Additional NIRCam 2 micron images resolve the HH46 IRS ~ 110 au binary system and suggest that the large asymmetries observed between the jet and the H2 wide angle emission could be due to two separate outflows being driven by the two sources. The spectra of the unresolved binary show deep ice bands and plenty of gaseous lines in absorption, likely originating in a cold envelope or disk. In conclusion, JWST has unraveled for the first time the origin of the HH46 IRS complex outflow demonstrating its capability to investigate embedded regions around young stars, which remain elusive even at near-IR wavelengths.
#### Impact of reflection Comptonization on X-ray reflection spectroscopy:  the case of EXO 1846-031

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06893
 - **Abstract**
 Within the disk-corona model, it is natural to expect that a fraction of reflection photons from the disk are Compton scattered by the hot corona (reflection Comptonization), even if this effect is usually ignored in X-ray reflection spectroscopy studies. We study the effect by using NICER and NuSTAR data of the Galactic black hole EXO 1846-031 in the hard-intermediate state with the model SIMPLCUTX. Our analysis suggests that a scattered fraction of order 10% is required to fit the data, but the inclusion of reflection Comptonization does not change appreciably the measurements of key-parameters like the black hole spin and the inclination angle of the disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Quasar variability has proven to be a powerful tool to constrain the properties of their inner engine and the accretion process onto supermassive black holes. Correlations between UV/optical variability and physical properties have been long studied with a plethora of different approaches and time-domain surveys, although the detailed picture is not yet clear. Aims: We analysed archival data from the SDSS Stripe-82 region to study how the quasar power spectral density (PSD) depends on the black hole mass, bolometric luminosity, accretion rate, redshift, and rest-frame wavelength. We developed a model-independent analysis framework that could be easily applied to upcoming large surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Methods: We used light curves of 8042 spectroscopically confirmed quasars, observed in at least six yearly seasons in five filters ugriz. We split the sample into bins of similar physical properties containing at least 50 sources, and we measured the ensemble PSD in each of them. Results: We find that a simple power law is a good fit to the power spectra in the frequency range explored. Variability does not depend on redshift at a fixed wavelength. Instead, both PSD amplitude and slope depend on the black hole mass, accretion rate, and rest-frame wavelength. We provide scaling relations to model the observed variability as a function of the physical properties, and discuss the possibility of a universal PSD shape for all quasars, where frequencies scale with the black hole mass, while normalization and slope(s) are fixed (at any given wavelength and accretion rate).
#### New Parameters for Star Cluster Dynamics: the role of clusters initial  conditions

 - **Abstract**
 We recently introduced three new parameters that describe the shape of the normalized cumulative radial distribution (nCRD) of the innermost stars in globular clusters and trace the clusters dynamical evolution. Here we extend our previous investigations to the case of a large set of Monte Carlo simulations of globular clusters, started from a broad range of initial conditions. All the models are analyzed at the same age of 13 Gyr, when they have reached different evolutionary phases. The sample of models is well representative of the structural properties of the observed population of Galactic globular clusters. We confirm that the three nCRD parameters are powerful tools to distinguish systems in early stages of dynamical evolution, from those that already experienced core collapse. They might also help disentangle clusters hosting a low-mass intermediate-mass black hole of a few hundred solar masses, from cases with large concentrations of dark remnants in their centers. With respect to other dynamical indicators, the nCRD parameters offer the advantage of being fully empirical and easier to measure from observational data.
#### Anisotropy ansatz for the axisymmetric Jeans equations

 - **Abstract**
 The Jeans equations do not form a closed system, and to solve them a parametrization relating the velocity moments is often adopted. For axisymmetric models, a phenomenological choice (the "$b$-ansatz") is widely used for the relation between the vertical ($\sigma_z^2$) and radial ($\sigma_R^2$) components of the velocity dispersion tensor, thus breaking their identity present in two-integral systems. However, the way in which the ansatz affects the resulting kinematical fields can be quite complicated, so that the analysis of these fields is usually performed only after numerically computing them. We present here a general procedure to study the properties of the ansatz-dependent fields $\overline{v_{\varphi}^2}$, $\Delta = \overline{v_{\varphi}^2} - \sigma_z^2$ and $\Delta_R = \overline{v_{\varphi}^2} - \sigma_R^2$. Specifically, the effects of the $b$-ansatz can be determined before solving the Jeans equations once the behaviour over the ($R,z$)-plane of three easy-to-build ansatz-independent functions is known. The procedure also constrains the ansatz to exclude unphysical results (as a negative $\overline{v_{\varphi}^2}$). The method is illustrated by discussing the cases of three well-known galaxy models: the Miyamoto & Nagai and Satoh disks, and the Binney logarithmic halo, for which the regions and the constraints on the ansatz values can be determined analytically; a two-component (Miyamoto & Nagai plus logarithmic halo) model is also discussed.
#### Relative Occurrence Rate Between Hot and Cold Jupiters as an Indicator  to Probe Planet Migration

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a second-order statistic parameter $\varepsilon$, the relative occurrence rate between hot and cold Jupiters ($\varepsilon=\eta_{\rm HJ}/\eta_{\rm CJ}$), to probe the migration of gas giants. Since the planet occurrence rate is the combined outcome of the formation and migration processes, a joint analysis of hot and cold Jupiter frequency may shed light on the dynamical evolution of giant planet systems. We first investigate the behavior of $\varepsilon$ as the stellar mass changes observationally. Based on the occurrence rate measurements of hot Jupiters ($\eta_{\rm HJ}$) from the TESS survey and cold Jupiters ($\eta_{\rm CJ}$) from the CLS survey, we find a tentative trend (97% confidence) that $\varepsilon$ drops when the stellar mass rises from $0.8$ to $1.4\ M_\odot$, which can be explained by different giant planet growth and disk migration timescales around different stars. We carry out planetesimal and pebble accretion simulations, both of which could reproduce the results of $\eta_{\rm HJ}$, $\eta_{\rm CJ}$ and $\varepsilon$. Our findings indicate that the classical core accretion + disk migration model can explain the observed decreasing trend of $\varepsilon$. We propose two ways to increase the significance of the trend and verify the anti-correlation. Future works are required to better constrain $\varepsilon$, especially for M dwarfs and for more massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we explore model independent constraints on the universe kinematics up to the snap and jerk hierarchical terms. To do so, we consider the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) release provided by the DESI collaboration, tackling the $r_d$ parameter to span within the range $[144,152]$ Mpc, with fixed step, $\delta r_d=2$ Mpc, aligning with Planck and DESI results. Thus, employing Monte Carlo Markov chain analyses, we place stringent constraints on the cosmographic series, incorporating three combinations of data catalogs: the first BAO with observational Hubble data, the second BAO with type Ia supernovae, and the last including all three data sets. Our results conclusively constrain the cosmographic series, say the deceleration $q_0$, the jerk $j_0$, and the snap $s_0$ parameters, at the $2$--$\sigma$ level, showcasing a significant departure on $j_0$ even at $1$--$\sigma$ confidence level, albeit being compatible with the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm on $q_0$ and $s_0$, at $2$--$\sigma$ level. Analogously, the $h_0$ tension appears alleviated in the second hierarchy, say including snap. Finally, a direct comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM models and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization is reported, definitively favoring the wCDM scenario.

 Nowadays, at least two relics of the Big Bang have survived - the cosmological microwave background (CMB) and the cosmological neutrino background (C$\nu$B). Being the second most abundant particle in the Universe, the neutrino has a significant impact on its evolution from the Big Bang to the present day. Neutrinos affect the following cosmological processes: the expansion rate of the Universe, its chemical and isotopic composition, the CMB anisotropy and the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Another relic neutrino background is theoretically predicted, it consists of non-equilibrium antineutrinos of Primordial Nucleosynthesis arising as a result of the decays of neutrons and tritium nuclei. Such antineutrinos are an indicator of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In addition to experimentally detectable active neutrinos, the existence of sterile neutrinos is theoretically predicted to generate neutrino masses and explain their oscillations. Sterile neutrinos can also solve such cosmological problems as the baryonic asymmetry of the Universe and the nature of dark matter. The recent results of several independent experiments point to the possibility of the existence of a light sterile neutrino. However, the existence of such a neutrino is inconsistent with the predictions of the Standard Cosmological Model. The inclusion of a non-zero lepton asymmetry of the Universe and/or increasing the energy density of active neutrinos can eliminate these contradictions and reconcile the possible existence of sterile neutrinos with Primordial Nucleosynthesis, the CMB anisotropy, and also reduce the H$_0$-tension. In this brief review, we discuss the influence of the physical properties of active and sterile neutrinos on the evolution of the Universe from the Big Bang to the present day.

 - **Abstract**
 GQ Lup B is a forming brown dwarf companion ($M\sim10-30~M_J$) showing evidence for an infrared excess associated with a disk surronding the companion itself. Here we present mid-infrared (MIR) observations of GQ Lup B with the Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) on JWST, spanning $4.8-11.7~\mu$m. We remove the stellar contamination using reference differential imaging based on principal component analysis (PCA), demonstrating that the MRS can perform high-contrast science. Our observations provide a sensitive probe of the disk surrounding GQ Lup B. We find no sign of a silicate feature, similar to other disk surrounding very low mass objects, which likely implies significant grain growth ($a_{\mathrm{min}}\gtrsim5~\mu$m), and potentially dust settling. Additionally, we find that if the emission is dominated by an inner wall, the disk around the companion might have an inner cavity larger than the one set by sublimation. Conversely, if our data probe the emission from a thin flat disk, we find the disk to be very compact. More observations are required to confirm this finding and assess the vertical structure of the disk. This approach paves the path to the future study of circumplanetary disks and their physical properties. Our results demonstrate that MIR spectroscopic observations can reveal the physical characteristics of disks around forming companions, providing unique insights into the formation of giant planets, brown dwarfs and their satellites.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for periodicity in the multi-wavelength high variable emission of blazars is a key feature to understand dynamical processes at work in this class of active galactic nuclei. The blazar PG 1553+113 is an attractive target due to the evidence of periodic oscillations observed at different wavelengths, with a solid proof of a 2.2-year modulation detected in the $\gamma$-ray, UV and optical bands. We aim at investigating the variability pattern of the PG 1553+113 X-ray emission using a more than 10-years long light curve, in order to robustly assess the presence or lack of a periodic behavior whose evidence is only marginal so far. We conducted detailed statistical analyses, studying in particular the variability properties of the X-ray emission of PG 1553+113 by computing the Lomb-Scargle periodograms, which are suited for the analyses of unevenly sampled time series, and adopting epoch folding techniques. We find out a modulation pattern in the X-ray light curve of PG 1553+113 with a period of $\sim$1.4 years, about 35% shorter than the one observed in the $\gamma$-ray domain. Our finding is in agreement with the recent spectro-polarimetric analyses and supports the presence of more dynamical phenomena simultaneously at work in the central engine of this quasar.

 - **Abstract**
 Utilizing high-cadence and continuous g- and r-band data over three nights acquired from the 3.6-meter Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) aimed to find short-duration microlensing events, we conduct a systematic search for variables, transients, and asteroids across a $\sim1^\circ$ field of view of the Andromeda Galaxy (M 31). We present a catalog of 5859 variable stars, yielding the most extensive compilation of short-period variable sources of M 31. We also detected 19 flares, predominantly associated with foreground M dwarfs in the Milky Way. In addition, we discovered 17 previously unknown asteroid candidates, and we subsequently reported them to the Minor Planet Center. Lastly, we report a microlensing event candidate C-ML-1 and present a preliminary analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn, play important roles in the formation and habitability of Earth-like planets. The detection of solar system analogs that have multiple cold giant planets is essential for our understanding of planet habitability and planet formation. Although transit surveys such as Kepler and TESS have discovered thousands of exoplanets, these missions are not sensitive to long period planets due to their limited observation baseline. The Tianyu project, comprising two 1-meter telescopes (Tianyu-I and II), is designed to detect transiting cold giant planets in order to find solar system analogs. Featuring a large field of view and equipped with a high-speed CMOS camera, Tianyu-I will perform a high-precision photometric survey of about 100 million stars, measuring light curves at hour-long cadence. The candidates found by Tianyu-I will be confirmed by Tianyu-II and other surveys and follow-up facilities through multi-band photometry, spectroscopy, and high resolution imaging. Tianyu telescopes will be situated at an elevation about 4000 meters in Lenghu, China. With a photometric precision of 1% for stars with V < 18 mag, Tianyu is expected to find more than 300 transiting exoplanets, including about 12 cold giant planets, over five years. A five-year survey of Tianyu would discover 1-2 solar system analogs. Moreover, Tianyu is also designed for non-exoplanetary exploration, incorporating multiple survey modes covering timescales from sub-seconds to months, with a particular emphasis on events occurring within the sub-second to hour range. It excels in observing areas such as infant supernovae, rare variable stars and binaries, tidal disruption events, Be stars, cometary activities, and interstellar objects. These discoveries not only enhance our comprehension of the universe but also offer compelling opportunities for public engagement in scientific exploration.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations point to old white dwarfs (WDs) accreting metals at a relatively constant rate over 8~Gyrs. Exo-Oort clouds around WDs have been proposed as potential reservoirs of materials, with galactic tide as a mechanism to deliver distant comets to the WD's Roche limit. In this work, we characterise the dynamics of comets around a WD with a companion having semi-major axes on the orders of 10 - 100 AU. We develop simulation techniques capable of integrating a large number ($10^8$) of objects over a 1 Gyr timescale. Our simulations include galactic tide and are capable of resolving close-interactions with a massive companion. Through simulations, we study the accretion rate of exo-Oort cloud comets into a WD's Roche limit. We also characterise the dynamics of precession and scattering induced on a comet by a massive companion. We find that (i) WD pollution by an exo-Oort cloud can be sustained over a Gyr timescale, (ii) an exo-Oort cloud with structure like our own Solar System's is capable of delivering materials into an isolated WD with pollution rate $\sim 10^8 \mathrm{~g~s^{-1}}$, (iii) adding a planetary-mass companion reduces the pollution rate to $\sim 10^7 \mathrm{~g~s^{-1}}$, and (iv) if the companion is stellar-mass, with $M_p \gtrsim 0.1 M_\odot$, the pollution rate reduces to $\sim 3 \times 10^5 \mathrm{~g~s^{-1}}$ due to a combination of precession induced on a comet by the companion, a strong scattering barrier, and low-likelihood of direct collisions of comets with the companion.
#### One-loop power spectrum in ultra slow-roll inflation and implications  for primordial black hole dark matter

 - **Abstract**
 We apply the in-in formalism to address the question of whether the size of the one-loop spectrum of curvature fluctuations in ultra-slow-roll inflation models designed for producing a large population of primordial black holes implies a breakdown of perturbation theory. We consider a simplified piece-wise description of inflation, in which the ultra-slow-roll phase is preceded and followed by slow-roll phases linked by transitional periods. We work in the $\delta\phi$-gauge, including all relevant cubic and quartic interactions and the necessary counterterms to renormalize the ultraviolet divergences, regularized by a cutoff. The ratio of the one-loop to the tree-level contributions to the spectrum of curvature perturbations is controlled by the duration of the ultra-slow-roll phase and of the transitions. Our results indicate that perturbation theory does not necessarily break in well-known models proposed to account for all the dark matter in the form of primordial black holes.
#### Searching for Cosmological Collider in the Planck CMB Data

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present the first comprehensive CMB data analysis of cosmological collider physics. New heavy particles during inflation can leave imprints in the primordial correlators which are observable in today's cosmological surveys. This remarkable detection channel provides an unsurpassed opportunity to probe new physics at extremely high energies. Here we initiate the search for these relic signals in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Planck legacy release. On the theory side, guided by recent progress from the cosmological bootstrap, we first propose a family of analytic bispectrum templates that incorporate the distinctive signatures of cosmological collider physics. Our consideration includes the oscillatory signals in the squeezed limit, the angular dependence from spinning fields, and several new shapes from nontrivial sound speed effects. On the observational side, we apply the recently developed pipeline, CMB Bispectrum Estimator (CMB-BEST), to efficiently analyze the three-point statistics and search directly for these new templates in the Planck 2018 temperature and polarization data. We report stringent CMB constraints on these new templates. Furthermore, we perform parameter scans to search for the best-fit values with maximum significance. For a benchmark example of collider templates, we find $f_{NL}=-91\pm40$ at the $68\%$ confidence level. After accounting for the look-elsewhere effect, the biggest adjusted significance we get is $1.8\sigma$. In general, we find no significant evidence of cosmological collider signals in the Planck data. However, this innovative analysis demonstrates the potential for discovering new heavy particles during inflation in forthcoming cosmological surveys.
#### Quasars as standard candles VI: spectroscopic validation of the  cosmological sample

 - **Abstract**
 A sample of quasars has been recently assembled to investigate the non-linear relation between their monochromatic luminosities at 2500{\AA}, and 2 keV and to exploit quasars as a new class of standardized candles. The use of this technique for cosmological purposes relies on the non-evolution with redshift of the UV-optical spectral properties of quasars, as well as on the absence of possible contaminants such as dust extinction and host-galaxy contribution. We address these possible issues by analysing the spectral properties of our cosmological quasar sample. We produced composite spectra in different bins of redshift and accretion parameters (black hole mass, bolometric luminosity), to investigate any possible evolution of the spectral properties of the continuum of the composites with these parameters. We found a remarkable similarity amongst the various stacked spectra. The overall shape of the continuum does not show any statistically significant trend with the accretion parameters nor with the redshift. The composite spectrum of our quasar sample is consistent with negligible levels of both intrinsic reddening (with a colour excess E(B-V)< 0.01) and host-galaxy emission (less than 10%) in the optical. We tested whether unaccounted dust extinction could explain the discrepancy between our cosmographic fit of the Hubble-Lemaitre diagram and the concordance {\Lambda}CDM model. The average colour excess required to solve the tension should increase with redshift up to unphysically high values (E(B-V)=0.1 at z>3) that would imply that the intrinsic emission of quasars is much bluer and more luminous than ever reported in observed spectra. The similarity of quasar spectra across the parameter space excludes a significant evolution of the average continuum properties with any of the explored parameters, confirming the reliability of our sample for cosmological applications.
