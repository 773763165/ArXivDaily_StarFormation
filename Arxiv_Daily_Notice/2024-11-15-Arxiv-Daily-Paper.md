          Does the fluid-static equilibrium of a self-gravitating isothermal sphere of van der Waals' gas present multiple solutions?

 We take up the investigation we had to put in the future-work stack at the end of \mbox{Sec. V B 2} of \ocite{dg2024pof}, in which we pointed out the obvious necessity to inquire about existence or absence of values of the characteristic numbers \itm{\alphay} and \itm{\betay} in correspondence to which the perfect-gas model's self gravitational effects, namely upper boundedness of the gravitational number, spiraling behavior of peripheral density, oscillating behavior of central density, and existence of multiple solutions corresponding to the same value of the gravitational number, appear also for the van der Waals' model. The development of our investigation brings to the conversion of our M$_{2}$ scheme based on a second-order differential equation into an equivalent system of two first-order differential equations that incorporates Milne's homology invariant variables. The converted scheme \fomt\ turns out to be much more efficacious than the M$_{2}$ scheme in terms of numerical calculations' easiness and richness of results. We use the perfect-gas model as benchmark to test the \fomt\ scheme; we re-derive familiar results and put them in a more general and rational perspective that paves the way to deal with the van der Waals' gas model. We introduce variable transformations that turn out to be the key to study (almost) analytically the monotonicity of the peripheral density with respect to variations of the gravitational number. ... The study brings to the proof that the gravitational number is not constrained by upper boundedness, the peripheral density does not spiral, and the central density does not oscillate for any couple of values assumed by the characteristic numbers \itm{\alphay} and \itm{\betay}; ...

 - **Abstract**
 The growth of ionized hydrogen bubbles in the intergalactic medium around early luminous objects is a fundamental process during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). In this study, we analyze bubble sizes and their evolution using the state-of-the-art THESAN radiation-hydrodynamics simulation suite, which self-consistently models radiation transport and realistic galaxy formation throughout a large (95.5 cMpc)^3 volume of the Universe. Analogous to the accretion and merger tree histories employed in galaxy formation simulations, we characterize the growth and merger rates of ionized bubbles by focusing on the spatially-resolved redshift of reionization. By tracing the chronological expansion of bubbles, we partition the simulation volume and construct a natural ionization history. We identify three distinct stages of ionized bubble growth: (1) initial slow expansion around the earliest ionizing sources seeding formation sites, (2) accelerated growth through percolation as bubbles begin to merge, and (3) rapid expansion dominated by the largest bubble. Notably, we find that the largest bubble emerges by z=9-10, well before the midpoint of reionization. This bubble becomes dominant during the second growth stage, and defines the third stage by rapidly expanding to eventually encompass the remainder of the simulation volume and becoming one of the few bubbles actively growing. Additionally, we observe a sharp decline in the number of bubbles with radii around ~10 cMpc compared to smaller sizes, indicating a characteristic scale in the final segmented bubble size distribution. Overall, these chronologically sequenced spatial reconstructions offer crucial insights into the physical mechanisms driving ionized bubble growth during the EoR and provide a framework for interpreting the structure and evolution of reionization itself.

          Why is the Galactic disk so cool?

 - **Abstract**
 The bulk of old stars in the Galactic disk have migrated radially by up to several kpc in their lifetimes, yet the disk has remained relatively cool, i.e., the ratio of radial heating to migration has been small. Here, we demonstrate that this small ratio places very strong constraints on which mechanisms could have been responsible for orbital transport in our Galaxy. For instance, Sellwood & Binney's mechanism of nonlinear horseshoe transport by spirals tends to produce too high a ratio of heating to migration, unless the spirals' amplitudes are heavily suppressed away from their corotation resonances, or their pitch angles are significantly larger than is observed. This problem is only made worse if one includes the effect of the Galactic bar, diffusion due to disk or halo substructure, etc. Resonant (but non-horseshoe) scattering by spirals can drive transport consistent with the data, but even this requires some fine-tuning. In short, reproducing both the observed radial migration and the small ratio of heating to migration is a highly nontrivial requirement, and poses a significant challenge to models of the Milky Way's dynamical history, theories of spiral structure, and the identification of 'Milky Way analogues' in cosmological simulations.

          Intermediate mass T Tauri disk masses and a comparison to their Herbig disk descendants

 - **Abstract**
 The precursors of Herbig stars are called Intermediate Mass T Tauri (IMTT) stars, which have spectral types later than F, but stellar masses between 1.5 and 5 M_\odot, and will eventually become Herbig stars with spectral types of A and B. ALMA Band 6 and 7 archival data are obtained for 34 IMTT disks with continuum observations, 32 of which have at least 12CO, 13CO, or C18O observations although most of them at quite shallow integrations. The disk integrated flux together with a stellar luminosity scaled disk temperature are used to obtain a total disk dust mass by assuming optically thin emission. Using thermochemical Dust And LInes (DALI) models from previous work, we additionally obtain gas masses of 10/35 of the IMTT disks based on the CO isotopologues. The IMTT disks in this study have the same dust mass and radius distributions as Herbig disks. The dust mass of the IMTT disks is higher compared to that of the T Tauri disks, as is also found for the Herbig disks. No differences in dust mass are found for group I versus group II disks, in contrast to Herbig disks. The disks for which a gas mass could be determined show similar high mass disks as for the Herbig disks. Comparing the disk dust and gas mass distributions to the mass distribution of exoplanets shows that there also is not enough dust mass in disks around intermediate mass stars to form the massive exoplanets. On the other hand there is more than enough gas to form the atmospheres of exoplanets. We conclude that the sampled IMTT disk population is almost indistinguishable compared to Herbig disks, as their disk masses are the same, even though these are younger objects. Based on this, we conclude that planet formation is already well on its way in these objects, and thus planet formation should start early on in the lifetime of Herbig disks.

 - **Abstract**
 How much cosmological information can we reliably extract from existing and upcoming large-scale structure observations? Many summary statistics fall short in describing the non-Gaussian nature of the late-time Universe in comparison to existing and upcoming measurements. In this article we demonstrate that we can identify optimal summary statistics and that we can link them with existing summary statistics. Using simulation based inference (SBI) with automatic data-compression, we learn summary statistics for galaxy catalogs in the context of cosmological parameter estimation. By construction these summary statistics do not require the ability to write down an explicit likelihood. We demonstrate that they can be used for efficient parameter inference. These summary statistics offer a new avenue for analyzing different simulation models for baryonic physics with respect to their relevance for the resulting cosmological features. The learned summary statistics are low-dimensional, feature the underlying simulation parameters, and are similar across different network architectures. To link our models, we identify the relevant scales associated to our summary statistics (e.g. in the range of modes between $k= 5 - 30 h/\mathrm{Mpc}$) and we are able to match the summary statistics to underlying simulation parameters across various simulation models.

 - **Abstract**
 Disks around intermediate mass stars called Herbig disks are the formation sites of giant exoplanets. Obtaining a complete inventory of these disks will therefore give insights into giant planet formation. However, until now no complete disk survey has been done on Herbig disks in a single star-forming region. Orion is the only nearby region with a significant number of Herbig disks (N=35) to carry out such a survey. Using new NOEMA observations of 25 Herbig disks, in combination with ALMA archival data of 10 Herbig disks, results in a complete sample of all know Herbig disks in Orion. Using uv-plane analysis for the NOEMA observed disks, and literature values of the ALMA observed disks, we obtain the dust masses of all Herbig disks and obtain a cumulative dust mass distribution. Additionally, six disks with new CO isotopologues detections are presented, one of which is detected in C17O. We calculate the external ultraviolet (UV) irradiance on each disk and compare the dust mass to it. We find a median disk dust mass of 11.7 M_\oplus for the Herbig disks. Comparing the Herbig disks in Orion to previous surveys for mainly T Tauri disks in Orion, we find that while ~50% of the Herbig disks have a mass higher than 10 M_\oplus, this is at most 25% for the T~Tauri disks. This difference is especially striking when considering that the Herbig disks are around a factor of two older than the T Tauri disks. Comparing to the Herbig disks observed with ALMA from a previous study, no significant difference is found between the distributions. We find a steeper (slope of -7.6) relationship between the dust mass and external UV irradation compared to that of the T~Tauri disks (slope of -1.3). This work shows the importance of complete samples, giving rise to the need of a complete survey of the Herbig disk population.

 - **Abstract**
 In the last few decades planet search surveys have been focusing on solar type stars, and only recently the high-mass regimes. This is mostly due to challenges arising from the lack of instrumental precision, and more importantly, the inherent active nature of fast rotating massive stars. Here we report NGTS-33b (TOI-6442b), a super-Jupiter planet with mass, radius and orbital period of 3.6 $\pm$ 0.3 M$_{\rm jup}$, 1.64 $\pm$ 0.07 R$_{\rm jup}$ and $2.827972 \pm 0.000001$ days, respectively. The host is a fast rotating ($0.6654 \pm 0.0006$ day) and hot (T$_{\rm eff}$ = 7437 $\pm$ 72 K) A9V type star, with a mass and radius of 1.60 $\pm$ 0.11 M$_{\odot}$ and 1.47 $\pm$ 0.06 R$_{\odot}$, respectively. Planet structure and Gyrochronology models shows that NGTS-33 is also very young with age limits of 10-50 Myr. In addition, membership analysis points towards the star being part of the Vela OB2 association, which has an age of $\sim$ 20-35 Myr, thus providing further evidences about the young nature of NGTS-33. Its low bulk density of 0.19$\pm$0.03 g cm$^{-3}$ is 13$\%$ smaller than expected when compared to transiting hot Jupiters with similar masses. Such cannot be solely explained by its age, where an up to 15$\%$ inflated atmosphere is expected from planet structure models. Finally, we found that its emission spectroscopy metric is similar to JWST community targets, making the planet an interesting target for atmospheric follow-up. Therefore, NGTS-33b's discovery will not only add to the scarce population of young, massive and hot Jupiters, but will also help place further strong constraints on current formation and evolution models for such planetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We focus on a sample of 42 sources in the vicinity of the bow-shock source IRS 1W (N-sources), located at the distance of $6.05''$ north-east of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), within the radius of $1.35''$. We present the first proper motion measurements of N-sources and find that a larger subset of N-sources (28 sources) exhibit a north-westward flying angle. These sources can be bound by an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) or the concentration that we observe is due to a disk-like distribution projection along the line of sight. We detect the N-sources in $H$, $K_s$, and $L$' bands. The north-westward flying sources could be a bound collection of stars. We discuss a tentative existence of an IMBH or an inclined disk distribution to explain a significant overdensity of stars. The first scenario of having an IMBH implies the lower limit of $\sim 10^4~M_\odot$ for the putative IMBH. Our measurements for the first time reveal that the dense association of stars containing IRS 1W is a co-moving group of massive, young stars. This stellar association might be the remnant core of a massive stellar cluster that is currently being tidally stripped as it inspirals towards Sgr A*. The second scenario suggests that the appearance of the N-sources might be influenced by the projection of a disk-like distribution of younger He-stars and/or dust-enshrouded stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Quark stars are challenging to confirm or exclude observationally because they can have similar masses and radii as neutron stars. By performing the first calculation of the non-equilibrium equation of state of decompressed quark matter at finite temperature, we determine the properties of the ejecta from binary quark-star or quark star-black hole mergers. We account for all relevant physical processes during the ejecta evolution, including quark nugget evaporation and cooling, and weak interactions. We find that these merger ejecta can differ significantly from those in neutron star mergers, depending on the binding energy of quark matter. For relatively high binding energies, quark star mergers are unlikely to produce r-process elements and kilonova signals. We propose that future observations of binary mergers and kilonovae could impose stringent constraints on the binding energy of quark matter and the existence of quark stars.

          Excess Radiation from Axion-Photon Conversion

 - **Abstract**
 Two notable anomalies in radio observations -- the excess radiation in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the cosmic microwave background, revealed by ARCADE2, and the twice-deeper absorption trough of the global 21cm line, identified by EDGES -- remain unresolved. These phenomena may have a shared origin, as the enhancement of the 21cm absorption trough could arise from excess heating. We investigate this scenario through the framework of axion-like particles (ALPs), showing that the resonant conversion of ALPs into photons can produce a photon abundance sufficient to resolve both anomalies simultaneously. Our model naturally explains the observed radio excess between 0.4 and 10GHz while also enhances the 21cm absorption feature at 78MHz. Furthermore, it predicts a novel power-law scaling of the radio spectrum above 0.5GHz and an additional absorption trough below 30MHz, which could be verified through cross-detection in upcoming experiments.

          Hawking Radiation from non-evaporating primordial black holes cannot enable the formation of direct collapse black holes

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe is a subject of significant debate. In this study, we examine whether non-evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) can offer a solution. We establish initial constraints on the range of PBH masses that correspond to Hawking radiation (HR) effective temperatures in the range needed to avoid the fragmentation of primordial gas into smaller, stellar-mass black holes. We also investigate the specific intensity of the HR from non-evaporating PBHs and compare it with the critical radiation needed for direct collapse black holes (DCBHs). We show that HR from non-evaporating PBHs cannot serve as the heating mechanism to facilitate the formation of the seeds for the SMBHs we observe in the high-redshift Universe unless, perhaps, the PBHs within the relevant mass range comprise a significant fraction of dark matter and are significantly clustered towards the center of the primordial halo.

          On the non-dissipative orbital evolution of a binary system comprising non-compact components with misaligned spin and orbital angular momenta

 - **Abstract**
 In this Paper we determine the non-dissipative tidal evolution of a close binary system with an arbitrary eccentricity in which the spin angular momenta of both components is misaligned with the orbital angular momentum. We focus on the situation where the orbital angular momentum dominates the spin angular momenta and so remains at small inclination to the conserved total angular momentum. Torques arising from rotational distortion and tidal distortion taking account of Coriolis forces are included. This extends the previous work of Ivanov & Papaloizou relaxing the limitation resulting from the assumption that one of the components is compact and has zero spin angular momentum. Unlike the above study, the evolution of spin-orbit inclination angles is driven by both types of torque. We develop a simple analytic theory describing the evolution of orbital angles and compare it with direct numerical simulations. We find that the tidal torque prevails near 'critical curves' in parameter space where the time-averaged apsidal precession rate is close to zero. In the limit of small spin, these curves exist only for systems that have at least one component with retrograde rotation. As in our previous work, we find solutions close to these curves for which the apsidal angle librates. As noted there, this could result in oscillation between prograde and retrograde states. We consider the application of our approach to systems with parameters similar to those of the misaligned binary DI Her.

 - **Abstract**
 An emerging commonality among the recently observed pulsar halos is the presence of distinct radiation patterns at high energies, while no extended radiation is detected around the GeV energy band. This commonality suggests that pulsar halos play a crucial role in the local propagation of cosmic rays, making it necessary to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon. This work focuses on the 3D propagation study of cosmic rays, incorporating the Geminga pulsar into our propagation model to investigate its contribution to different observational spectra. We consider Geminga a dominant local source of positrons, successfully reproducing the observed positron spectrum and multi-energy spectra of the Geminga halo. Through calculations of signal and background at different angles, we find that: (1) at low energies, the slow diffusion characteristic around the pulsar region leads to a low electron density in the extended area around Geminga, causing the background radiation to exceed the signal intensity far; (2) at high energies, the larger effective diffusion radius of high-energy electrons/positrons causes the signal from Geminga to dominate the local high-energy phenomena; (3) the observed fluctuation of diffuse gamma-ray radiation by LHAASO is likely due to the incomplete subtraction of radiation from the local halo. We hope LHAASO will detect more cosmic ray halo sources to validate our model further.

          Chemical pathways of SO2 with hydrogen atoms on interstellar ice analogues

 - **Abstract**
 Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a sulfur-containing molecule expected to exist as a solid in the interstellar medium (ISM). In this study, we performed laboratory experiments and computational analyses on the surface reactions of solid SO2 with hydrogen atoms on amorphous solid water (ASW) at low temperatures. After 40 min of exposure of SO2 deposited on ASW to H atoms, approximately 80% of the solid SO2 was lost from the substrate at 10-40 K, and approximately 50% even at 60 K, without any definite detection of reaction products. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that H atoms preferentially add to the S atom of solid SO2, forming the HSO2 radical. Further reactions of the HSO2 radical with H atoms result in the formation of several S-bearing species, including HS(O)OH, the S(O)OH radical, HO-S-OH, HS-OH, and H2S. In codeposition experiments involving H and SO2, we confirmed the formation of H2S, HS(O)OH, and/or HO-S-OH. However, the yields of these S-bearing species were insufficient to account for the complete loss of the initial SO2 reactant. These findings suggest that some products desorbed into the gas phase upon formation. This study indicates that a portion of SO2 in ice mantles may remain unreacted, avoiding hydrogenation, while the remainder is converted into other species, some of which may be subject to chemical desorption.

          Solar Energetic Particle Track Accumulation in Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt Dust Grains

 - **Abstract**
 Interplanetary dust grains (IDPs) originate from a variety of sources and are dynamically transported across the solar system. While in transport, high-$Z$ solar energetic particles (SEPs) with energies of $\sim$1 MeV/nuc leave damage tracks as they pass through IDPs. SEP track densities can be used as a measure of a grain's space exposure and in turn, help to constrain their lifetimes and origins. Stratospherically collected IDPs with relatively high track densities ($>10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$) have been interpreted as originating from the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt. To further test this hypothesis, we use a dynamical dust grain tracing model to explore the accumulation of SEP tracks within EKB dust grains. We demonstrate that, neglecting collisions, dust grains with radii up to 500 $\mu$m are capable of transiting from the EKB to 1 au despite gravitational perturbations from the outer planets, albeit with decreasing probability as a function of size. Despite this, we find that EKB grains cannot accumulate sufficient tracks to match those reported in the terrestrial stratospheric IDP collection when applying SEP track accumulation rates established from lunar samples at 1 au and assuming the SEP flux scales with heliocentric distance as $r^{-1.7}$. By exploring the radial scaling of the SEP flux, we find that a shallower SEP radial distribution of $r^{-1.0}$ does allow for the accumulation of $>$$10^{10}$ tracks cm$^{-2}$ in EKB dust grains that reach 1 au. We urge further research into the propagation and distribution of high-$Z$ SEPs throughout the heliosphere in order to better constrain track accumulation in IDPs.

          Enhanced Stability in Planetary Systems with Similar Masses

 - **Abstract**
 This study employs numerical simulations to explore the relationship between the dynamical instability of planetary systems and the uniformity of planetary masses within the system, quantified by the Gini index. Our findings reveal a significant correlation between system stability and mass uniformity. Specifically, planetary systems with higher mass uniformity demonstrate increased stability, particularly when they are distant from first-order mean motion resonances (MMRs). In general, for non-resonant planetary systems with a constant total mass, non-equal mass systems are less stable than equal mass systems for a given spacing in units of mutual Hill radius. This instability may arise from the equipartition of the total random energy, which can lead to higher eccentricities in smaller planets, ultimately destabilizing the system. This work suggests that the observed mass uniformity within multi-planet systems detected by \textit{Kepler} may result from a combination of survival bias and ongoing dynamical evolution processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Spontaneous rotation of an ultra-small satellite was observed and its driving torque was explained by the thermal interaction between the air molecules and the surfaces of the satellite heated by the radiation from the earth. This mechanism has the similarity with a usual radiometer, except the point that the velocity of the satellite is sufficiently faster than that of the thermal velocity of the air molecules, and that the mean free path of the air molecules is sufficiently longer than the characteristic length of the satellite. Using dimension analysis, the torque was found to be significant to a small size of satellite. This rotation mechanism can be applied to any small objects, which are revolting around a planet radiating a black body radiation and has the atmospheric gas.

 We reanalyze the spectral lag data for of GRB 160625B using frequentist inference to constrain the energy scale ($E_{QG}$) of Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV). For this purpose, we use profile likelihood to deal with the astrophysical nuisance parameters. This is in contrast to Bayesian inference implemented in previous works, where marginalization was carried out over the nuisance parameters. We show that with profile likelihood, we do not find a global minimum for $\chi^2$ as a function of $E_{QG}$ below the Planck scale for both the linear and quadratic models of LIV, whereas bounded credible intervals were obtained using Bayesian inference. Therefore, we can set lower limits in a straightforward manner. We find that $E_{QG} \geq 3.7 \times 10^{16}$ GeV and $E_{QG} \geq 2.6 \times 10^7$ GeV at 68\% c.l., for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively. Therefore, this is the first proof of principles application of profile likelihood method to the analysis of GRB spectral lag data to constrain LIV.

 - **Abstract**
 The dominant accretion process leading to the formation of the terrestrial planets of the Solar System is a subject of intense scientific debate. Two radically different scenarios have been proposed. The classic scenario starts from a disk of planetesimals which, by mutual collisions, produce a set of Moon to Mars-mass planetary embryos. After the removal of gas from the disk, the embryos experience mutual giant impacts which, together with the accretion of additional planetesimals, lead to the formation of the terrestrial planets on a timescale of tens of millions of years. In the alternative, pebble accretion scenario, the terrestrial planets grow by accreting sunward-drifting mm-cm sized particles from the outer disk. The planets all form within the lifetime of the disk, with the sole exception of Earth, which undergoes a single post-disk giant impact with Theia (a fifth protoplanet formed by pebble accretion itself) to form the Moon. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we revisit all available constraints: compositional (in terms of nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies and chemical composition), dynamical and chronological. We find that the pebble accretion scenario is unable to match these constraints in a self-consistent manner, unlike the classic scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 A subsonic flow of an ideal gas through a flat channel in the presence of a mass force field is considered. The forces acting on the gas are reduced to the attraction to the channel axis in a certain region of the channel. It has been shown that the occurrence of a zone of increased pressure along the axis of a channel leads to the formation of a pressure gradient, which acts as an effective force which opposes the flow. As a result, the flow becomes unstable. For a weak field, this instability is symmetric, while for strong fields it is asymmetric. The characteristics of this instability have been studied numerically in the present work. Possible astrophysical implications of this phenomenon are also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Dozens of B-type hypervelocity stars (HVSs) moving faster than the Galactic escape speed have been discovered in the Galactic halo and are produced most likely by the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the Galactic Center (GC). However, the velocity distribution and in particular the deficit of the HVSs above 700 km/s is seriously inconsistent with the expectations of the present models. Here we show that the high-velocity deficit is due to the deficiency in close interactions of stars with the SMBH, because an orbiting intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) of about 15,000 Solar mass kicked away slowly approaching stars 50-250 million years ago. The SMBH-IMBH binary formed probably after the merger of the Galaxy with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) dwarf galaxy, and coalesced about 10 million years ago. Afterwards, HVSs with speed up to above 3000 km/s are produced by binary tidal disruptions and the counterparts formed the S-star cluster at the GC.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the LAMOST spectroscopy and TESS time-series photometry, we have obtained a main-sequence star sample of $\delta$ Scuti and $\gamma$ Doradus stars. The sample includes 1534 $\delta$ Sct stars, 367 $\gamma$ Dor stars, 1703 $\delta$ Sct$| \gamma$ Dor stars, 270 $\gamma$ Dor$| \delta$ Sct stars, along with 105 '$\delta$ Sct candidates' and 32 '$\gamma$ Dor candidates'. After correcting for projection effects, we derived the equatorial rotational velocity distribution for $\delta$ Sct and $\gamma$ Dor stars and compared it with that of normal stars. The rotational velocity distributions of $\delta$ Sct and $\gamma$ Dor stars are extremely similar, with the only difference potentially due to the rotational variable stars that have not been completely removed. In contrast, the rotational velocity distribution of normal stars is more dispersed compared to pulsating stars. Additionally, the peak rotational velocity of the pulsating stars is about 10 km s$^{-1}$ higher than that of normal stars. Unlike the normal stars, which show a monotonic increase in peak velocity with mass between 1.8 and 2.5 $M_{\odot}$, the rotational velocity distribution of $\delta$ Sct stars does not exhibit a strong mass dependence. We also found that normal stars accelerate during the late main-sequence evolutionary phase, while $\delta$ Sct stars decelerate. Furthermore, there may still be unclassified stars with diverse rotational properties in the normal star sample compared to the $\delta$ Sct stars, which is likely to be an important contributor to the broader dispersion observed in its rotational velocity distribution. The photometric amplitude in $\delta$ Sct stars is modulated with rotational velocity, with high-amplitude stars typically rotating slowly and low-amplitude stars showing a broad distribution of rotational velocities.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gravitation Wave (GW) signals from a large number of double white dwarfs (DWDs) in the Galaxy are expected to be detected by space GW detectors, e.g., the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), Taiji, and Tianqin in the millihertz band. In this paper, we present an alternative method by directly using the time-domain GW signal detected by space GW detectors to constrain the anisotropic structure of the Galaxy. The information of anisotropic distribution of DWDs is naturally encoded in the time-domain GW signal because of the variation of the detectors' directions and consequently the pattern functions due to their annual motion around the sun. The direct use of the time-domain GW signal enables simple calculations, such as utilizing an analytical method to assess the noise arising from the superposition of random phases of DWDs and using appropriate weights to improve the constraints. We investigate the possible constraints on the scale of the Galactic thin disk and bulge that may be obtained from LISA and Taiji by using this method with mock signals obtained from population synthesis models. We further show the different constraining capabilities of the low-frequency signal (foreground) and the high-frequency signal (resolvable-sources) via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, and find that the scale height and length of the Galactic thin disk and the scale radius of bulge can be constrained to a fractional accuracy of ~ 30%, 30%, 40% (or 20%, 10%, 40%) by using the low-frequency (or high-frequency) signal detected by LISA or Taiji.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-energy cosmic rays (LECRs) play a crucial role in the formation of planetary systems, and detecting and reconstructing the properties of early LECRs is essential for understanding the mechanisms of planetary system formation. Given that LECRs interact with the surrounding medium to produce nuclear de-excitation line emissions, which are gamma-ray emissions with energy mainly within 0.1--10 MeV and are unaffected by stellar wind modulation, these emissions can accurately reflect the properties of LECRs. This study introduces an innovative method for using gamma-ray emissions to infer LECR properties. We employed the Parker transport equation to simulate the propagation and spectral evolution of LECRs in a protoplanetary disk and calculated the characteristic gamma-ray emissions resulting from interactions between LECRs and disk material. These gamma-ray emissions encapsulate the spectral information of LECRs, providing a powerful tool to reconstruct the cosmic ray environment at that time. This method, supported by further theoretical developments and observations, will fundamentally enhance our understanding of the impact of CRs on the origin and evolution of planetary systems and address significant scientific questions regarding the cosmic ray environment at the origin of life.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the onset of a coronal mass ejection (CME) using spectroscopic observations in 5303 Å coronal emission line with the Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) onboard ADITYA-L1, the recently launched first Indian space solar mission. The CME was observed on 16 July 2024 in association with a X1.9 class soft X-ray flare from heliographic location S05W85. The VELC observations were near the west limb of Sun during the CME. The results obtained helped to constrain the onset time of the CME. In addition, they indicate ${\approx}$50% decrease in the coronal intensity near the source region of the CME due to mass depletion, ${\approx}$15% enhancement in the emission line width, and redshifted Doppler velocity of about ${\approx}10$ km/s. The non-thermal velocity associated with the line broadening is ${\approx}24.87$ km/s.

 We examined in depth the star BD+00 444 (GJ 105.5, TOI-2443; V = 9.5 mag; d = 23.9 pc), with the aim of characterizing and confirming the planetary nature of its small companion, the planet candidate TOI-2443.01, which was discovered by TESS. We monitored BD+00 444 with the HARPS-N spectrograph for 1.5 years to search for planet-induced radial-velocity (RV) variations, and then analyzed the RV measurements jointly with TESS and ground-based photometry. We determined that the host is a quiet K5 V, and we revealed that the sub-Neptune BD+00 444 b has a radius of $R_b=2.36\pm0.05 R_{\oplus}$, a mass of $M_b=4.8\pm1.1 M_{\oplus}$ and, consequently, a rather low-density value of $\rho_b=2.00+0.49-0.45$ g cm-3, which makes it compatible with both an Earth-like rocky interior with a thin H-He atmosphere and a half-rocky, half-water composition with a small amount of H-He. Having an orbital period of about 15.67 days and an equilibrium temperature of about 519 K, BD+00 444 b has an estimated transmission spectroscopy metric of about 159, which makes it ideal for atmospheric follow-up with the JWST. Notably, it is the second most eccentric inner transiting planet, $e=0.302+0.051-0.035$, with a mass below 20 $M_{\oplus}$, among those with well-determined eccentricities. We estimated that tidal forces from the host star affect both planet b's rotation and eccentricity, and strong tidal dissipation may signal intense volcanic activity. Furthermore, our analysis suggests the presence of a sub-Neptune-mass planet candidate, BD+00 444 c, having an orbital period of $P=96.6\pm1.4$ days, and a minimum mass $M\sin{i}=9.3+1.8-2.0 M_{\oplus}$. With an equilibrium temperature of about 283 K, BD+00 444 c is right inside the habitable zone; however, this candidate necessitates further observations and stronger statistical evidence to be confirmed.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a super-Earth candidate orbiting the nearby mid M dwarf Gl\,725A using the radial velocity (RV) method. The planetary signal has been independently identified using high-precision RVs from the SOPHIE and SPIRou spectrographs, in the optical and near-infrared domains, respectively. We modelled the stellar activity signal jointly with the planet using two Gaussian Processes, one for each instrument to account for the chromaticity of the stellar activity and instrumental systematics, along with a Keplerian model. The signal is significantly detected with a RV semi-amplitude of $1.67\pm0.20$ m/s. The planet Gl 725A b is found to be in an orbit compatible with circular with a period of $11.2201\pm0.0051$ days. We analysed 27 sectors of TESS photometry on which no transit event was found. We determined a minimum mass of $M_{p}\sin{i}=2.78\pm0.35\,M_{\oplus}$ which places the planet in the super-Earth regime. Using Mass-Radius relationships we predict a planetary radius to be between 1.2 and $2.0\,R_{\oplus}$. The proximity of Gl 725A, of only 3.5 pc, makes this new exoplanet one of the closest to Earth and joins the group of S-type low-mass planets in short orbits ($P<15$ d) around close M dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 The orbital period of a cataclysmic variable stands as a crucial parameter for investigating the structure and physics of these binary systems, as well as understanding their evolution. We use photometric Gaia data for dwarf novae (DNe) in the quiescent state which are available for a number of years to determine new orbital periods and improve/modify previously suggested values. Two approaches are implemented for selecting high-inclination targets, either eclipsing or with ellipsoidal variations. We determine new orbital periods for 75 DNe and improve ephemerides for 27 more (three of which change significantly), contributing 9.4% of the known DNe periods of 0.05-2.0 days, and doubling the number of known periods exceeding 0.44 days. Their phase-folded light curves are presented and arranged by orbital period, illustrating the transition from short-period systems, dominated by radiation from the accretion disc and the hot spot, to longer-period DNe, where the Roche-lobe-filling secondary star is the primary visual flux source. This transition -which occurs around the well-known period gap (around 2-3 hours)- is expected, as DNe with larger orbital periods typically harbour more massive donors, which contribute to the visible flux. However, this transition is not abrupt. Within the same range of periods, we observe systems dominated by ellipsoidal variations, where the companion star is clearly visible, as well as others dominated by the disc and hot spot. The presence of some DNe with ellipsoidal variations near the lower edge of the period gap is striking, as the companions in these systems are expected to be cool low-mass M-dwarfs not visible in the light curve. This could indicate that we are observing systems where the donor star was originally much more massive and underwent significant nuclear evolution before mass-transfer began, as has been suggested previously for QZ Ser.

 - **Abstract**
 The empirical classification of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) is based on their distribution in the plane of burst duration and spectral hardness. Two distinct distributions, long-soft and short-hard bursts, are observed in this plane, forming the basis for the long and short classification scheme. Traditionally, this scheme was mapped to two different GRB progenitor classes. However, several recent bursts have challenged this mapping. This work investigates how an observer's viewing angle relative to the jet axis influences the duration-hardness plane. We simulate single-pulse GRBs using an optically and geometrically thin homogeneous top-hat jet model. Bursts are simulated with an isotropic viewing angle distribution, and we calculate the pulse duration and spectral hardness corresponding to \textit{FERMI} Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) energy bands. The viewing angle significantly impacts spectral hardness for our assumed broken power-law spectra, while its effect on duration is less pronounced. Our analysis indicates that soft and low-luminous bursts are likely off-axis events. It is possible that some of the fast X-ray transients and X-ray rich GRBs observed by the Einstein Probe and the Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) missions originate from off-axis jets.
