 - **Abstract**
 We illustrate the formation and evolution of the Milky Way over cosmic time, utilizing a sample of 10 million red giant stars with full chemodynamical information, including metallicities and $\alpha$-abundances from low-resolution Gaia XP spectra. The evolution of angular momentum as a function of metallicity - a rough proxy for stellar age, particularly for high-[$\alpha$/Fe] stars - displays three distinct phases: the disordered and chaotic protogalaxy, the kinematically-hot old disk, and the kinematically-cold young disk. The old high-$\alpha$ disk starts at [Fe/H] $\approx -1.0$, 'spinning up' from the nascent protogalaxy, and then exhibits a smooth 'cooldown' toward more ordered and circular orbits at higher metallicities. The young low-$\alpha$ disk is kinematically cold throughout its metallicity range, with its observed properties modulated by a strong radial gradient. We interpret these trends using Milky Way analogs from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, identifying one that closely matches the kinematic evolution of our Galaxy. This halo's protogalaxy spins up into a relatively thin and misaligned high-$\alpha$ disk at early times, which is subsequently heated and torqued by a major gas-rich merger. The merger contributes a large amount of low-metallicity gas and angular momentum, from which the kinematically cold low-$\alpha$ stellar disk is subsequently born. This simulated history parallels several observed features of the Milky Way, particularly the decisive 'GSE' merger that likely occurred at $z \approx 2$. Our results provide an all-sky perspective on the emerging picture of our Galaxy's three-phase formation, impelled by the three physical mechanisms of spinup, merger, and cooldown.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents the results concerning six red giant stars members of the globular cluster NGC 6558. Our analysis utilized high-resolution near-infrared spectra obtained through the CAPOS initiative (the APOgee Survey of Clusters in the Galactic Bulge), which focuses on surveying clusters within the Galactic Bulge, as a component of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment II survey (APOGEE-2). We employ the BACCHUS (Brussels Automatic Code for Characterizing High accUracy Spectra) code to provide line-by-line elemental-abundances for Fe-peak (Fe, Ni), $\alpha$-(O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), light-(C, N), odd-Z (Al), and the $s$-process element (Ce) for the 4 stars with high signal-to-noise ratios. This is the first reliable measure of the CNO abundances for NGC 6558. Our analysis yields a mean metallicity for NGC 6558 of $\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle$ = $-$1.15 $\pm$ 0.08, with no evidence for a metallicity spread. We find a Solar Ni abundance, $\langle$[Ni/Fe]$\rangle$ $\sim$ $+$0.01, and a moderate enhancement of $\alpha$-elements, ranging between $+$0.16 to $<+$0.42, and a slight enhancement of the $s$-process element $\langle$[Ce/Fe]$\rangle$ $\sim$ $+$0.19. We also found low levels of $\langle$[Al/Fe]$\rangle \sim $+$0.09$, but with a strong enrichment of nitrogen, [N/Fe]$>+$0.99, along with a low level of carbon, [C/Fe]$<-$0.12. This behaviour of Nitrogen-Carbon is a typical chemical signature for the presence of multiple stellar populations in virtually all GCs; this is the first time that it is reported in NGC 6558. We also observed a remarkable consistency in the behaviour of all the chemical species compared to the other CAPOS bulge GCs of the same metallicity.
#### OGLE-2014-BLG-0221Lb: A Jupiter Mass Ratio Companion Orbiting either a  Late-Type Star or a Stellar Remnant

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of microlensing event OGLE-2014-BLG-0221, a planetary candidate event discovered in 2014. The photometric light curve is best described by a binary-lens single-source model. Our light curve modeling finds two degenerate models, with event timescales of $t_\mathrm{E}\sim70$ days and $\sim110$ days. These timescales are relatively long, indicating that the discovered system would possess a substantial mass. The two models are similar in their planetary parameters with a Jupiter mass ratio of $q \sim 10^{-3}$ and a separation of $s \sim 1.1$. While the shorter timescale model shows marginal detection of a microlensing parallax signal, the longer timescale model requires a higher order effect of microlensing parallax, lens orbital motion or xallarap to explain the deviation in the light curve. However, the modeling shows significant correlation between the higher order effects and suffers the ecliptic degeneracy that results in a failure to determine the parallax parameters. Bayesian inference is used to estimate the physical parameters of the lens, revealing the lens to be either a late-type star supported by the shorter timescale model or a stellar remnant supported by the longer timescale model. If the lens is a remnant, this would be the second planet found by microlensing around a stellar remnant. Since the models predict different values for relative proper motion and source flux, future high angular resolution follow-up observations (e.g. Keck adaptive optics) are required to rule out either of the models.

 - **Abstract**
 Forthcoming missions probing the absolute intensity of the CMB are expected to be able to measure spectral distortions, which are deviations from its blackbody distribution. As cosmic inflation can induce spectral distortions, these experiments offer a possibility to further test the various promising inflationary proposals, whose predictions need to be carefully determined. After numerically fitting all inflationary observables to match current observations, we compute the predicted spectral distortions of various promising single and multifield inflationary models. The predictions of single-field inflationary models display deviations between 1% and 20% with respect to the standard cosmological model in the observable window, where multi-natural and axion-monodromy inflation stand out in this respect. In the case of multifield inflation, we observe a richer structure of the power spectrum, which, in the case of so-called hybrid attractors, yields spectral distortions about 100 times more intense than the standard signal. These observations open up questions about the relation among our results and other cosmological observables that are also to be probed soon.
#### Asteroid 2023 NT1: A Cautionary Tale

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a variety of short warning time, terminal mitigation scenarios via fragmentation for a hypothetical impact of asteroid 2023 NT1, a Near-Earth Object (NEO) that was discovered on July 15, 2023, two days after its closest approach to Earth on July 13. The asteroid passed by Earth within ~0.25 lunar distances with a closest approach distance of ~10$^{5}$ km and speed of 11.27 km/s. Its size remains largely uncertain, with an estimated diameter range of 26 - 58 m and probable diameter estimate (weighted by the NEO size frequency distribution) of 34 m (JPL Sentry, September 12, 2023). The asteroid approached Earth from the direction of the Sun, as did both the Chelyabinsk asteroid in 2013 and comet NEOWISE in 2021. As a result, 2023 NT1 remained undetected until after its closest approach. If it had been on a collision course, it would have had an impact energy of ~1.5 Mt (assuming a spherical asteroid with the probable diameter estimate of 34 m, 2.6 g/cm$^{3}$ uniform density, and impact speed of 15.59 km/s). 2023 NT1 represents a threat that could have caused significant local damage (~3x Chelyabinsk airburst energy). We utilize the PI ("Pulverize It") method for planetary defense to model potential mitigation scenarios of an object like 2023 NT1 through simulations of hypervelocity asteroid disruption and atmospheric ground effects for the case of a terminal defense mode. Simulations suggest that PI is an effective multimodal approach for planetary defense that can operate in extremely short interdiction modes (with intercepts as short as hours prior to impact), in addition to long interdiction time scales with months to years of warning. Our simulations support the proposition that threats like 2023 NT1 can be effectively mitigated with intercepts of one day (or less) prior to impact, yielding minimal to no ground damage, using modest resources and existing technologies.
#### ALMA-IMF IX: Catalog and Physical Properties of 315 SiO Outflow  Candidates in 15 Massive Protoclusters

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of 315 protostellar outflow candidates detected in SiO J=5-4 in the ALMA-IMF Large Program, observed with ~2000 au spatial resolution, 0.339 km/s velocity resolution, and 2-12 mJy/beam (0.18-0.8 K) sensitivity. We find median outflow masses, momenta, and kinetic energies of ~0.3 M$_{\odot}$, 4 M$_{\odot}$ km/s, and 10$^{45}$ erg, respectively. Median outflow lifetimes are 6,000 years, yielding median mass, momentum, and energy rates of $\dot{M}$ = 10$^{-4.4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, $\dot{P}$ = 10$^{-3.2}$ M$_{\odot}$ km/s yr$^{-1}$, and $\dot{E}$ = 1 L$_{\odot}$. We analyze these outflow properties in the aggregate in each field. We find correlations between field-aggregated SiO outflow properties and total mass in cores (~3$-$5$\sigma$), and no correlations above 3$\sigma$ with clump mass, clump luminosity, or clump luminosity-to-mass ratio. We perform a linear regression analysis and find that the correlation between field-aggregated outflow mass and total clump mass - which has been previously described in the literature - may actually be mediated by the relationship between outflow mass and total mass in cores. We also find that the most massive SiO outflow in each field is typically responsible for only 15-30% of the total outflow mass (60% upper limit). Our data agree well with the established mechanical force-bolometric luminosity relationship in the literature, and our data extend this relationship up to L $\geq$ 10$^6$ L$_{\odot}$ and $\dot{P}$ $\geq$ 1 M$_{\odot}$ km/s yr$^{-1}$. Our lack of correlation with clump L/M is inconsistent with models of protocluster formation in which all protostars start forming at the same time.
#### Wind-mass transfer in S-type symbiotic binaries IV. Indication of high  wind-mass-transfer efficiency from active phases

 - **Abstract**
 Observational indications of wind-mass transfer from an evolved giant to its distant white dwarf (WD) companion in symbiotic binaries are rare. Here, we present a way to examine the neutral wind from the giant in symbiotic binaries, which is temporarily observable throughout the orbital plane during outbursts. We find that the mass-loss rate from giants in the orbital plane of S-type symbiotic binaries is high, indicating a high wind-mass-transfer efficiency in these systems. We modeled hydrogen column densities in the orbital plane between the observer and the WD for all suitable eclipsing S-type symbiotic binaries during outbursts in any orbital phase. The mass-loss rate from the giant in the orbital plane is on the order of 10$^{-6}\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, which is a factor of $\sim$10 higher than rates derived from nebular emission produced by the ionized wind from normal giants in symbiotic stars. This finding suggests a substantial focusing of the giant's wind toward the orbital plane and, thus, its effective transfer onto the WD companion. Our finding suggests that wind focusing on the orbital plane may be a common property of winds from giants in S-type symbiotic stars. Such wind-focusing resolves a long-standing problem of the large energetic output from their burning WDs and deficient fueling by the giant via a standard Bondi-Hoyle accretion. It also allows the WD to grow faster in mass, which lends support to the possibility that S-type symbiotic binaries are progenitors of Type Ia supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore neutrino emission from nonrotating, single star models across six initial metallicities and seventy initial masses from the zero-age main sequence to the final fate. Overall, across the mass spectrum, we find metal-poor stellar models tend to have denser, hotter and more massive cores with lower envelope opacities, larger surface luminosities, and larger effective temperatures than their metal-rich counterparts. Across the mass-metallicity plane we identify the sequence (initial CNO $\rightarrow$ $^{14}$N $\rightarrow$ $^{22}$Ne $\rightarrow$ $^{25}$Mg $\rightarrow$ $^{26}$Al $\rightarrow$ $^{26}$Mg $\rightarrow$ $^{30}$P $\rightarrow$ $^{30}$Si) as making primary contributions to the neutrino luminosity at different phases of evolution. For the low-mass models we find neutrino emission from the nitrogen flash and thermal pulse phases of evolution depend strongly on the initial metallicity. For the high-mass models, neutrino emission at He-core ignition and He-shell burning depends strongly on the initial metallicity. Anti-neutrino emission during C, Ne, and O burning shows a strong metallicity dependence with $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$,$n$)$^{25}$Mg providing much of the neutron excess available for inverse-$\beta$ decays. We integrate the stellar tracks over an initial mass function and time to investigate the neutrino emission from a simple stellar population. We find average neutrino emission from simple stellar populations to be 0.5--1.2 MeV electron neutrinos. Lower metallicity stellar populations produce slightly larger neutrino luminosities and average $\beta$ decay energies. This study can provide targets for neutrino detectors from individual stars and stellar populations. We provide convenient fitting formulae and open access to the photon and neutrino tracks for more sophisticated population synthesis models.

 - **Abstract**
 This dissertation is written as an annotated collection of selected articles. The dissertation focuses on the modelling of accretion disks in X-ray binaries with a black hole or neutron star. The main objective is to use advanced numerical methods to reveal the fundamental processes that influence the observed spectral and temporal features. Among the significant results of this modelling is the recognition of the puffy accretion disk, a novel type of accretion disk based purely on the results of numerical simulations. Furthermore, the work focuses on modelling the X-ray variability and quasi-periodic oscillations using analytical models of accretion disks, but an advanced description of the oscillations, and a discussion of the implications of this modelling for observational data.
#### Survival in the Neptune desert: LTT 9779 b kept its atmosphere thanks to  an unusually X-ray faint host star

 - **Abstract**
 The Neptunian desert is a region in period-radius parameter space with very few Neptune-sized planets at short orbital periods. Amongst these, LTT 9779 b is the only known Neptune with a period shorter than one day to retain a significant H-He atmosphere. If the Neptune desert is the result of X-ray/EUV-driven photoevaporation, it is surprising that the atmosphere of LTT 9779 b survived the intense bombardment of high energy photons from its young host star. However, the star has low measured rotational broadening, which points to the possibility of an anomalously slow spin period and hence a faint X-ray emission history that may have failed to evaporate the planet's atmosphere. We observed LTT 9779 with XMM-Newton and measured an upper limit for its X-ray luminosity that is a factor of fifteen lower than expected for its age. We also simulated the evaporation past of LTT 9779 b and found that the survival of its atmosphere to the present day is consistent with an unusually faint XUV irradiation history that matches both the X-ray and rotation velocity measurements. We conclude that the anomalously low X-ray irradiation of the one Neptune seen to survive in Neptunian desert supports the interpretation of the desert as primarily a result of photoevaporation.
#### Flat to nonflat: Calculating nonlinear power spectra of biased tracers  for nonflat $Λ$CDM model

 - **Abstract**
 The growth of large-scale structure, together with the geometrical information of cosmic expansion history and cosmological distances, can be used to obtain constraints on the spatial curvature of the universe that probes the early universe physics, whereas modeling the nonlinear growth in a nonflat universe is still challenging due to computational expense of simulations in a high-dimensional cosmological parameter space. In this paper, we develop an approximate method to compute the halo-matter and halo-auto power spectra for nonflat $\Lambda$CDM model, from quantities representing the nonlinear evolution of the corresponding flat $\Lambda$CDM model, based on the separate universe (SU) method. By utilizing the fact that the growth response to long-wavelength fluctuations (equivalently the curvature), $T_{\delta_{\rm b}}(k)$, is approximated by the response to the Hubble parameter, $T_h(k)$, our method allows one to estimate the nonlinear power spectra in a nonflat universe efficiently from the power spectra of the flat universe. We use $N$-body simulations to show that the estimator can provide the halo-matter (halo-auto) power spectrum at $\sim 1\%$ ($\sim 2\%$ ) accuracy up to $k \simeq 3 (1) \, h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ even for a model with large curvature $\Omega_K = \pm 0.1$. Using the estimator we can extend the prediction of the existing emulators such as Dark Emulator to nonflat models without degrading their accuracy. Since the response to long-wavelength fluctuations is also a key quantity for estimating the super sample covariance (SSC), we discuss that the approximate identity $T_{\delta_{\rm b}}(k) \approx T_h(k)$ can be used to calculate the SSC terms analytically.
#### Primordial Origin of Supermassive Black Holes from Axion Bubbles

 - **Abstract**
 We study a modification of the primordial black hole (PBH) formation model from axion bubbles. We assume that the Peccei-Quinn scalar rolls down in the radial direction from a large field value to the potential minimum during inflation, which suppresses the axion fluctuations and weakens the clustering of PBHs on large scales. We find that the modified model can produce a sufficient number of PBHs that seed the supermassive black holes while avoiding the observational constraints from isocurvature perturbations and angular correlation of the high-redshift quasars.

 - **Abstract**
 The Committee on Radio Astronomy Frequencies (CRAF) is an Expert Committee of the European Science Foundation. It aims to provide a cost-effective single voice on frequency protection issues for European radio astronomy observatories and research institutes, achieving a significantly greater impact than that achievable by individual national institutions. By working together, European observatories and institutes can profit from synergy effects, cover many more topics, and learn from each other. CRAF was founded in 1988 and has since then been engaged with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), in particular its Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R), and the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) and its European Communications Committee (ECC). This is the self-evaluation report prepared by CRAF for its periodic review of the years 2011-2021.
#### Imaging detection of the inner dust belt and the four exoplanets in the  HR8799 system with JWST's MIRI coronagraph

 - **Abstract**
 The multi planet system HR8799 is the first target observed with MIRI's coronagraphs as part of the MIRI-EC Guaranteed Time Observations exoplanets programme in Nov. 2022. We obtained deep observations in three coronagraphic filters from 10 to 15mic (F1065C, F1140C, F1550C), and one standard imaging filter at 20 mic (F2100W), with the goal to extract the photometry of the four planets, as well as to detect and investigate the distribution of circumstellar dust. Using dedicated observations of a reference star, we tested several algorithms to subtract the stellar diffraction pattern while preserving the fluxes of planets, which can be significantly affected by over-subtraction. Measuring correctly the planet's flux values requires accounting for the attenuation by the coronagraphs as a function of their position, and to estimate the normalisation with respect to the central star. We tested several procedures to derive averaged photometric values and error bars. These observations have enabled us to obtain two main results. First of all, the four planets in the system are well recovered, and their mid-IR fluxes, combined with near-IR flux values from the literature, are compared to two exoplanet atmosphere models, ATMO and Exo-REM. As a main outcome, the MIRI photometric data points imply larger radii (0.86 or 1.07 RJ for planet b) and cooler temperatures (950 or 1100 K for planet b), especially for planet b, in better agreement with evolutionary models. Second of all, these JWST/MIRI coronagraphic data also deliver the first spatially resolved detection of the inner warm debris disk, the radius of which is constrained to about 15 au, with flux densities comparable, but lower than former unresolved spectroscopic measurements with Spitzer. abridged...

 - **Abstract**
 Studying stars that are located off the Galactic plane is important for understanding the formation history of the Milky Way. We searched for SiO masers toward off-plane O-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars from the catalog presented by Mauron et al. (2019) in order to shed light on the origin of these objects. A total of 102 stars were observed in the SiO $J$=1-0, $v=1$ and 2 transitions with the Effelsberg-100 m and Tianma-65 m telescopes. SiO masers were discovered in eight stars, all first detections. The measured maser velocities allow the first estimates of the host AGB stars' radial velocities. We find that the radial velocities of three stars (namely G068.881-24.615, G070.384-24.886, and G084.453-21.863) significantly deviate from the values expected from Galactic circular motion. The updated distances and 3D motions indicate that G068.881$-$24.615 is likely located in the Galactic halo, while G160.648-08.846 is probably located in the Galactic thin disk, and the other six stars are probably part of the Galactic thick disk.

 Is the population of close-in planets orbiting M dwarfs sculpted by thermally driven escape or is it a direct outcome of the planet formation process? A number of recent empirical results strongly suggest the latter. However, the unique architecture of the TOI-1266 planetary system presents a challenge to models of planet formation and atmospheric escape given its seemingly "inverted" architecture of a large sub-Neptune ($P_b=10.9$ days, $R_{p,b}=2.62\pm 0.11\, \mathrm{R}_{\oplus}$) whose orbit is interior to that of the system's smaller planet ($P_c=18.8$ days, $R_{p,c}=2.13\pm 0.12\, \mathrm{R}_{\oplus}$). Here we present revised planetary radii based on new TESS and diffuser-assisted ground-based transit observations and characterize both planetary masses using a set of 145 radial velocity (RV) measurements from HARPS-N ($M_{p,b}=4.23\pm 0.69\, \mathrm{M}_{\oplus}, M_{p,c}=2.88\pm 0.80\, \mathrm{M}_{\oplus}$). Our RV analysis also reveals a third planet candidate ($P_d=32.3$ days, $M_{p,d}\sin{i} = 4.59^{+0.96}_{-0.94}\, \mathrm{M}_{\oplus}$), which if real, would form a chain of 5:3 period ratios, although we show that the system is likely not in a mean motion resonance. Our results indicate that TOI-1266 b and c are the lowest density sub-Neptunes known around M dwarfs and may exhibit distinct bulk compositions of a gas-enveloped terrestrial ($X_{\mathrm{env},b}=5.5\pm 0.7$%) and a water-rich world (WMF$_c=59\pm 14$%), which is supported by hydrodynamic escape models. If distinct bulk compositions for the transiting planets are confirmed by atmospheric characterization, the system's unique architecture would represent an interesting test case for sub-Neptune formation models such as inside-out planet formation at pebble traps.

 - **Abstract**
 In 2015, the Planck Collaboration released an all-sky map of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect, obtained by implementing the Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC) method on the Planck PR2 data. The quality of the Planck data has significantly improved since then. The Planck PR4 data release offers upgraded full-sky maps in the LFI and HFI frequency bands with improved systematics and sensitivity. We present a new all-sky thermal SZ Compton $y$-parameter map derived from the Planck PR4 data using NILC and highlight improvements, particularly in noise reduction and handling residual foreground contamination. The PR4 NILC Compton $y$-parameter map has been made publicly available to support further analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectral observations of Neptune made in 2019 with the MUSE instrument at the Very Large Telescope in Chile have been analysed to determine the spatial variation of aerosol scattering properties and methane abundance in Neptune's atmosphere. The darkening of the South Polar Wave (SPW) at $\sim$ 60$^\circ$S, and dark spots such as the Voyager 2 Great Dark Spot is concluded to be due to a spectrally-dependent darkening ($\lambda < 650$nm) of particles in a deep aerosol layer at $\sim$ 5 bar and presumed to be composed of a mixture of photochemically-generated haze and H$_2$S ice. We also note a regular latitudinal variation of reflectivity at wavelengths of very low methane absorption longer than $\sim$ 650 nm, with bright zones latitudinally separated by $\sim$ 25$^\circ$. This feature, similar to the spectral characteristics of a discrete deep bright spot DBS-2019 found in our data, is found to be consistent with a brightening of the particles in the same $\sim$5-bar aerosol layer at $\lambda > 650 $ nm. We find the properties of an overlying methane/haze aerosol layer at $\sim$ 2 bar are, to first-order, invariant with latitude, while variations in the opacity of an upper tropospheric haze layer reproduce the observed reflectivity at methane-absorbing wavelengths, with higher abundances found at the equator and also in a narrow `zone' at $80^\circ$S. Finally, we find the mean abundance of methane below its condensation level to be 6--7% at the equator reducing to $\sim$3% south of $\sim$25$^\circ$S, although the absolute abundances are model dependent.

 - **Abstract**
 Mature neutron stars are expected exhibit gravity g-modes due to stratification caused by varying composition. These modes are affected by nuclear reactions, leading to complex (damped) mode frequencies and the suppression of high order g-modes, in contrast with the common non-dissipative analysis which leads to an infinite g-mode spectrum. Focusing on the transition between the fast and slow reaction regimes, we examine the impact of nuclear reactions on the g-mode spectrum. The general framework for the analysis is presented along with sample numerical results for the BSk21 equation of state and the standard Urca reactions.

 - **Abstract**
 Elementary particles such as quarks and gluons are expected to be fundamental degrees of freedom at ultra high temperatures or densities, while natural phenomena in our daily lives are described in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom. Massive neutron stars and remnants of binary neutron star mergers may contain quark matter, but it is not known how the transition from hadron matter to quark matter occurs. Different transition scenarios predict different gravitational waveforms emitted from binary neutron star mergers. If the difference between the equations of state occurs at sufficiently high density, it is expected that the difference between waveforms mainly appears in the merger or the post-merger phase rather than in the inspiral phase. The typical frequency of gravitational waves after the coalescence is higher than 2 kHz, which is difficult to observe using current detectors. In this study, we performed Bayesian model selection for two representative scenarios and investigated whether observations with future detectors will allow us to identify the correct model. We assume that the relatively low density equation of state around the nuclear saturation density is completely known from accumulated observations. Under this assumption, we find that it is reasonable to expect to be able to identify the correct transition scenario with third-generation detectors or specialized detectors with high sensitivity at high frequencies designed for post-merger signal observation, e.g., NEMO.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the characterisation of an inner mini-Neptune in a 9.2292005$\pm$0.0000063 day orbit and an outer mono-transiting sub-Saturn planet in a 95.50$^{+0.36}_{-0.25}$ day orbit around the moderately active, bright (mv=8.9 mag) K5V star TOI-2134. Based on our analysis of five sectors of TESS data, we determine the radii of TOI-2134b and c to be 2.69$\pm$0.16 R$_{e}$ for the inner planet and 7.27$\pm$0.42 R$_{e}$ for the outer one. We acquired 111 radial-velocity spectra with HARPS-N and 108 radial-velocity spectra with SOPHIE. After careful periodogram analysis, we derive masses for both planets via Gaussian Process regression: 9.13$^{+0.78}_{-0.76}$ M$_{e}$ for TOI-2134b and 41.86$^{+7.69}_{-7.83}$ M$_{e}$ for TOI-2134c. We analysed the photometric and radial-velocity data first separately, then jointly. The inner planet is a mini-Neptune with density consistent with either a water-world or a rocky core planet with a low-mass H/He envelope. The outer planet has a bulk density similar to Saturn's. The outer planet is derived to have a significant eccentricity of 0.67$^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$ from a combination of photometry and RVs. We compute the irradiation of TOI-2134c as 1.45$\pm$0.10 times the bolometric flux received by Earth, positioning it for part of its orbit in the habitable sone of its system. We recommend further RV observations to fully constrain the orbit of TOI-2134c. With an expected Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect amplitude of 7.2$\pm$1.3 m/s, we recommend TOI-2134c for follow-up RM analysis to study the spin-orbit architecture of the system. We calculate the Transmission Spectroscopy Metric, and both planets are suitable for bright-mode NIRCam atmospheric characterisation.

 - **Abstract**
 Physical constraints have been suggested to make neural network models more generalizable, act scientifically plausible, and be more data-efficient over unconstrained baselines. In this report, we present preliminary work on evaluating the effects of adding soft physical constraints to computer vision neural networks trained to estimate the conditional density of redshift on input galaxy images for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We introduce physically motivated soft constraint terms that are not implemented with differential or integral operators. We frame this work as a simple ablation study where the effect of including soft physical constraints is compared to an unconstrained baseline. We compare networks using standard point estimate metrics for photometric redshift estimation, as well as metrics to evaluate how faithful our conditional density estimate represents the probability over the ensemble of our test dataset. We find no evidence that the implemented soft physical constraints are more effective regularizers than augmentation.
#### How Pulsars Shine II: TeV emission

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discovery of 20 TeV radiation from the Vela pulsar confirms (tentatively, at the level of crude estimates) the Aristotelian Electrodynamics picture of pulsar radiation: pulsars shine, mostly in GeV, by annihilating colliding Poynting fluxes into curvature radiation near the light cylinder. The observed GeV photons are the curvature radiation of electrons/positrons with Lorentz factors ~10^8. These "super-ultra-relativistic" electrons/positrons must also produce TeV radiation by inverse Compton if low-energy target photons are available, as they are in the Vela pulsar.
#### Planet Gap-opening Feedback on Disk Thermal Structure and Composition

 - **Abstract**
 (Exo-)planets inherit their budget of chemical elements from a protoplanetary disk. The disk temperature determines the phase of each chemical species, which sets the composition of solids and gas available for planet formation. We investigate how gap structures, which are widely seen by recent disk observations, alter the thermal and chemical structure of a disk. Planet-disk interaction is a leading hypothesis of gap formation and so such changes could present a feedback that planets have on planet-forming material. Both the planet gap-opening process and the disk thermal structure are well studied individually, but how the gap-opening process affects disk thermal structure evolution remains an open question. We develop a new modelling method by iterating hydrodynamical and radiative transfer simulations to explore the gap-opening feedback on disk thermal structure. We carry out parameter studies by considering different planet locations rp and planet masses Mp. We find that for the same rp and Mp, our iteration method predicts a wider and deeper gap than the non-iteration method. We also find that the inner disk and gap temperature from the iteration method can vary strongly from the non-iteration or disk without planets, which can further influence dust-trap conditions, iceline locations, and distribution of various ices, such as H2O, CO2, and CO on large dust grains ("pebbles"). Through that, a gap-opening planet can complicate the canonical picture of the non-planet disk C/O ratio and influence the composition of the next generation of planetesimals and planets.
