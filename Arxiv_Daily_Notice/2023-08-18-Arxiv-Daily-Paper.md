 - **Abstract**
 Hydrogen sulfide (H$_2$S) is thought to be efficiently formed on grain surfaces through the successive hydrogenation of S atoms. Its non-detection so far in astronomical observations of icy dust mantles thus indicates that effective destruction pathways must play a significant role in its interstellar abundance. While chemical desorption has been shown to remove H$_2$S very efficiently from the ice, in line with H$_2$S gas-phase detections, possible solid-state chemistry triggered by the related HS radical have been largely disregarded so far -- despite it being an essential intermediate in the H$_2$S + H reaction scheme. We aim to thoroughly investigate the fate of H$_2$S upon H-atom impact under molecular cloud conditions, providing a comprehensive analysis combined with detailed quantification of both the chemical desorption and ice chemistry that ensues. Experiments are performed in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber at temperatures between 10--16 K. The changes in the solid phase during H-atom bombardment are monitored in situ by means of reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS), and desorbed species are measured with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS). We confirm the formation of H$_2$S$_2$ via reactions involving H$_2$S + H, and quantify its formation cross section under the employed experimental conditions. Additionally, we directly assess the chemical desorption of H$_2$S by measuring the gas-phase desorption signals with the QMS, providing unambiguous desorption cross sections. Chemical desorption of H$_2$S$_2$ was not observed. The relative decrease of H$_2$S ices by chemical desorption changes from ~85% to ~74% between temperatures of 10 and 16 K, while the decrease as the result of H$_2$S$_2$ formation is enhanced from ~5% to ~26%, suggesting an increasingly relevant sulfur chemistry induced by HS radicals at warmer environments. The astronomical implications are further discussed.
#### A large topographic feature on the surface of the trans-Neptunian object  (307261) 2002 MS$_4$ measured from stellar occultations

 - **Abstract**
 This work aims at constraining the size, shape, and geometric albedo of the dwarf planet candidate 2002 MS4 through the analysis of nine stellar occultation events. Using multichord detection, we also studied the object's topography by analyzing the obtained limb and the residuals between observed chords and the best-fitted ellipse. We predicted and organized the observational campaigns of nine stellar occultations by 2002 MS4 between 2019 and 2022, resulting in two single-chord events, four double-chord detections, and three events with three to up to sixty-one positive chords. Using 13 selected chords from the 8 August 2020 event, we determined the global elliptical limb of 2002 MS4. The best-fitted ellipse, combined with the object's rotational information from the literature, constrains the object's size, shape, and albedo. Additionally, we developed a new method to characterize topography features on the object's limb. The global limb has a semi-major axis of 412 $\pm$ 10 km, a semi-minor axis of 385 $\pm$ 17 km, and the position angle of the minor axis is 121 $^\circ$ $\pm$ 16$^\circ$. From this instantaneous limb, we obtained 2002 MS4's geometric albedo and the projected area-equivalent diameter. Significant deviations from the fitted ellipse in the northernmost limb are detected from multiple sites highlighting three distinct topographic features: one 11 km depth depression followed by a 25$^{+4}_{-5}$ km height elevation next to a crater-like depression with an extension of 322 $\pm$ 39 km and 45.1 $\pm$ 1.5 km deep. Our results present an object that is $\approx$138 km smaller in diameter than derived from thermal data, possibly indicating the presence of a so-far unknown satellite. However, within the error bars, the geometric albedo in the V-band agrees with the results published in the literature, even with the radiometric-derived albedo.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the conjugate angle of radial action ($\theta_R$), the best representation of the orbital phase, to explore the "mid-plane, north branch, south branch" and "Monoceros area" disk structures that were previously revealed in the LAMOST K giants (Xu et al. 2020). The former three substructures, identified by their 3D kinematical distributions, have been shown to be projections of the phase space spiral (resulting from nonequilibrium phase mixing). In this work, we find that all of these substructures associated with the phase spiral show high aggregation in conjugate angle phase space, indicating that the clumping in conjugate angle space is a feature of ongoing, incomplete phase mixing. We do not find the $Z-V_Z$ phase spiral located in the "Monoceros area", but we do find a very highly concentrated substructure in the quadrant of conjugate angle space with the orbital phase from the apocenter to the guiding radius. The existence of the clump in conjugate angle space provides a complementary way to connect the "Monoceros area" with the direct response to a perturbation from a significant gravitationally interactive event. Using test particle simulations, we show that these features are analogous to disturbances caused by the impact of the last passage of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy.
#### Slow diffusion around pulsar $γ$-ray halos and its impact on cosmic  rays propagation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08099
 - **Abstract**
 The diffusion coefficients around the pulsar $\gamma$-ray halos are highly suppressed compared with the value in the interstellar medium. It is suggested in the literature that the $\gamma$-ray halos can be explained by a ballistic-diffusive (BD) propagation without slow diffusion. However our calculation shows that the BD propagation can not account for the $\gamma$-ray halo profile well. Furthermore the transfer efficiency of the pulsar spin down energy to the high energy electrons and positrons is even larger than 1 in the BD scenario. Therefore slow diffusion is necessary to account for the pulsar $\gamma$-ray halos. Taking the slow diffusion into account the contribution of positron flux originated from nearby pulsars to the AMS-02 data is reexamined. We may also expect a slow diffusion disk of the Milky Way as many such slow diffusion regions exist. The positron contribution to the AMS-02 data from dark matter annihilation in the new propagation model is also reexamined. We find that the dark matter scenario satisfies all the $\gamma$-ray limits in the new propagation model.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the linear polarimetric observations, we present a method to derive the membership probability of stars in cluster NGC 2345. The polarimetric observations of cluster NGC 2345 are performed using the instrument ARIES IMaging POLarimeter (AIMPOL) mounted as a backend of the 104-cm telescope of ARIES. Members of the cluster should exhibit comparable polarization since they are located nearly at the same distance. This concept is used to extract the membership probability of known member stars of cluster NGC 2345. The membership probability estimated using the polarimetric data for cluster NGC 2345 agrees with the membership probability derived from the proper motion method in the previous studies.
#### Galactic and Extragalactic Analysis of the Astrophysical Muon Neutrino  Flux with 12.3 years of IceCube Track Data

 - **Abstract**
 The Ice Cube Neutrino Observatory has been measuring an isotropic astrophysical neutrino flux in multiple detection channels for almost a decade. Galactic diffuse emission, which arises from the interactions between cosmic rays and the interstellar medium, is an expected signal in IceCube. The superposition of an extragalactic flux and a galactic flux results in directional structure and variations in the spectrum. In this work, we use 12.3 years of high-purity muon-neutrino induced muon track data to perform a dedicated search for this galactic emission, combined with a spectral measurement of the isotropic astrophysical neutrino flux. To distinguish a galactic component from the dominant atmospheric and isotropic astrophysical components, the precise directional information available for muon tracks is fully utilized in a three-dimensional forward folding likelihood fit. We test a state-of-the-art model prediction of galactic diffuse emission based on recent cosmic ray data (CRINGE). We fit this prediction as a template scaled by a factor $\Psi_{\mathrm{CRINGE}}$, and find $2.9\pm 1.1 \times \Psi_{\mathrm{CRINGE}}$ with a significance of $2.7\sigma$ in an energy range between 400 GeV and 60 TeV in the Northern Sky.

 - **Abstract**
 This work is the seventh study in a series dedicated to investigating degeneracies of simultaneous age, mass, extinction, and metallicity determinations of partially resolved or unresolved star clusters with Hubble Space Telescope broadband aperture photometry. In the sixth work (hereafter, Paper I), it was demonstrated that the adaptive aperture photometry, performed to avoid the majority of the projected foreground and background stars falling within the apertures, gives more consistent colour indices for star clusters. In this study, we aim to supplement the homogeneous multi-colour aperture photometry results published in Paper~I and provide a complete M31 Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey star cluster photometry catalogue for further analysis. Following Paper I, we used a two-aperture approach for photometry. The first aperture is the standard one used to measure total cluster fluxes. The second (smaller) aperture is introduced to avoid the bright foreground and background stars projecting onto the clusters. We selected the radii of smaller apertures to be larger than the half-light radii of the clusters. We present the second part of the star cluster aperture photometry catalogues for a sample of 1477 star clusters from the M31 PHAT survey not covered in Paper I. Compared to the M31 PHAT star cluster aperture photometry catalogue published by Johnson et al., adjustments were made to the cluster centre coordinates, aperture sizes, and sky background levels.
#### Fundamental scaling relationships revealed in the optical light curves  of tidal disruption events

 - **Abstract**
 We present fundamental scaling relationships between properties of the optical/UV light curves of tidal disruption events (TDEs) and the mass of the black hole that disrupted the star. We have uncovered these relations from the late-time emission of TDEs. Using a sample of 63 optically-selected TDEs, the latest catalog to date, we observed flattening of the early-time emission into a near-constant late-time plateau for at least two-thirds of our sources. Compared to other properties of the TDE lightcurves (e.g., peak luminosity or decay rate) the plateau luminosity shows the tightest correlation with the total mass of host galaxy ($p$-value of $2 \times 10^{-6}$, with a residual scatter of 0.3 dex). Physically this plateau stems from the presence of an accretion flow. We demonstrate theoretically and numerically that the amplitude of this plateau emission is strongly correlated with black hole mass. By simulating a large population of TDEs, we determine a plateau luminosity-black hole mass scaling relationship well described by $ \log_{10} \left(M_{\bullet}/M_{\odot} \right) = 1.50 \log_{10} \left( L_{\rm plat}/10^{43} {\rm erg \, s^{-1}} \right) + 9.0 $. The observed plateau luminosities of TDEs and black hole masses in our large sample are in excellent agreement with this simulation. Using the black hole mass predicted from the observed TDE plateau luminosity, we reproduce the well-known scaling relations between black hole mass and galaxy velocity dispersion. The large black hole masses of 10 of the TDEs in our sample allow us to provide constraints on their black hole spins, favouring rapidly rotating black holes. We add 49 (34) black hole masses to the galaxy mass (velocity dispersion) scaling relationships, updating and extending these correlations into the low black hole mass regime.
#### Uncertainty study for the Galactic calibration of radio antenna arrays  in astroparticle physics

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, arrays of radio antennas operating in the MHz regime have shown great potential as detectors in astroparticle physics. In particular, they fulfill an important role in the indirect detection of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. For a proper determination of the energy scale of the primary particles, accurate absolute calibration of radio detectors is crucial. Galactic calibration - i.e., using the Galaxy-dominated radio sky as a reference source - will potentially be the standard method for this task. However, uncertainties in the strength of the Galactic radio emission lead to uncertainties in the absolute calibration of the radio detectors and, thus, in the energy scale of the cosmic-ray measurements. To quantify these uncertainties, we present a study comparing seven sky models in the radio-frequency range of 30 to 408 MHz. By conversion to the locally visible sky, we estimate the uncertainties for the cases of the radio antenna arrays of GRAND, IceCube, LOFAR, OVRO-LWA, the Pierre Auger Observatory, RNO-G and SKA-low. Finally, we discuss the applicability of the Galactic calibration, for example, regarding the influence of the quiet Sun.
#### Neutrinos and Asteroseismology of Stars over the Helium Flash

 - **Abstract**
 The helium flash, occurring in stars of 0.6-2.0 M$_\odot$ at the end of the red giant branch, is not observable via optical means due to the energy of the process being used to lift the core out of degeneracy. Neutrinos, which are linked to the ignition of reactions triggered during the flash and serve as the only cooling process in the inert core, can help characterize changes in internal structure. In this work, we create 18 stellar models across three mass and six metallicity values, chosen in the context of the stellar abundance problem, to compare the evolutionary path up to and probe the helium flash by conducting a detailed study of neutrino emission throughout this crucial phase of stellar evolution. We demonstrate how thermal neutrino emissions could have an imprint on global asteroseismic parameters and use them as an additional tool to infer the impact of compositional changes. We find that a precision of 0.3 $\mu$Hz in the determination of $\Delta \nu$ is enough to distinguish between between the two most prominent solar composition models and confirm that asteroseismic observation can be enough to classify a star as undergoing the process of helium subflashes. We also predict nuclear neutrino emission fluxes and their evolution for all relevant sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Clouds seem unavoidable in cool and dense environments, and hence, are necessary to explain observations of exoplanet atmospheres, most recently of WASP 96b with JWST. Understanding the formation of cloud condensation nuclei in non-terrestrial environments is therefore crucial to develop accurate models to interpret present and future observations. Aims. The goal of the paper is to support observations with infrared spectra for (TiO2)N clusters in order to study cloud formation in exoplanet atmospheres. Methods. Vibrational frequencies are derived from quantum-chemical calculations for 123 (TiO2)-clusters and their isomers, and line-broadening mechanisms are evaluated. Cluster spectra are calculated for several atmospheric levels for two example exoplanet atmospheres (WASP 121b-like and WASP 96b-like) to identify possible spectral fingerprints for cloud formation. Results. Rotational motion of and transitions in the clusters cause significant line broadening, so that individual vibrational lines are broadened beyond the spectral resolution of the medium resolution mode of the JWST mid-infrared instrument MIRI at R = 3000. However, each individual cluster isomer exhibits a "fingerprint" IR spectrum. In particular, larger (TiO2)-clusters have distinctly different spectra from smaller clusters. Morning and evening terminator for the same planet can exhibit different total absorbances due to different cluster sizes being more abundant. Conclusions. The largest (TiO2)-clusters are not necessarily the most abundant (TiO2)-clusters in the high-altitude regions of ultra-hot Jupiters, and the different cluster isomers will contribute to the local absorbance. Planets with a considerable day-night asymmetry will be most suitable to search for (TiO2)-cluster isomers in order to improve cloud formation modelling.
#### White Dwarf Mass Growth in Cataclysmic Variables: Roles of Dwarf Novae

 - **Abstract**
 The disc instability mechanism (DIM) is widely accepted to account for the transient behaviour of dwarf novae (DNe), which experience short outbursts separated by long quiescence. The duty cycle (the ratio between the outburst duration and the recurrence time) determines the amount of accreted mass by the white dwarf (WDs) during outbursts, thus playing an important role in the long-term binary evolution. Employing the code of Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics, we systemically investigate the influence of the duty cycles on the evolution of DNe and the mass growth of accreting carbon-oxygen (CO) WDs. Our calculations show that, while the DIM can considerably influence the accretion process, efficient WD-mass growth requires a particular range of the duty cycle. For WDs with the initial masses of 0.6, 0.7 and 1.1 $M_\odot$, these duty cycles are 0.006$\,\leq$$d$$\,\leq$0.007, $d$\,=\,0.005 and $d$\,=\,0.003, and the accumulated mass of the WDs can reach 0.1, 0.13 and 0.21 $M_\odot$, respectively. In all of our simulations, no CO WDs can grow their masses to the explosion mass of Type Ia supernovae of about $1.38~M_\odot$. Because of a much short timescale of the outburst state, the final donor-star masses and orbital periods are insensitive to the duty cycles. Therefore, we propose that the DIM in DNe could alleviate the WD mass problem to some extent.
#### Fallback onto Kicked Neutron Stars and its Effect on Spin-Kick Alignment

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08312
 - **Abstract**
 Fallback in core-collapse supernova explosions is potentially of significant importance for the birth spins of neutron stars and black holes. It has recently been pointed out that the angular momentum imparted onto a compact remnant by fallback material is subtly intertwined with its kick because fallback onto a moving neutron star or black hole will preferentially come for a conical region around its direction of travel. We show that contrary to earlier expectations such one-sided fallback accretion onto a neutron star will tend to produce spin-kick misalignment. Since the baroclinic driving term in the vorticity equation is perpendicular to the nearly radial pressure gradient, convective eddies in the progenitor as well as Rayleigh-Taylor plumes growing during the explosion primarily carry angular momentum perpendicular to the radial direction. Fallback material from the accretion volume of a moving neutron star therefore carries substantial angular momentum perpendicular to the kick velocity. We estimate the seed angular momentum fluctuations from convective motions in core-collapse supernova progenitors and argue that accreted fallback material will almost invariably be accreted with the maximum permissible specific angular momentum for reaching the Alfv\'en radius. This imposes a limit of $\mathord{\sim}10^{-2}M_\odot$ of fallback accretion for fast-spinning young neutron stars with periods of $\mathord{\sim}20\,\mathrm{ms}$ and less for longer birth spin periods.

 - **Abstract**
 In the last few years, the NICER collaboration has provided mass and radius inferences, via pulse profile modeling, for two pulsars: PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620. Given the importance of these results for constraining the equation of state of dense nuclear matter, it is crucial to validate them and test their robustness. We therefore explore the reliability of these results and their sensitivity to analysis settings and random processes, including noise, focusing on the specific case of PSR J0030+0451. We use X-PSI, one of the two main analysis pipelines currently employed by the NICER collaboration for mass and radius inferences. With synthetic data that mimic the PSR J0030+0451 NICER data set, we evaluate the recovery performances of X-PSI under conditions never tested before, including complex modeling of the thermally emitting neutron star surface. For the test cases explored, our results suggest that X-PSI is capable of recovering the true mass and radius within reasonable credible intervals. This work also reveals the main vulnerabilities of the analysis: a significant dependence on noise and the presence of multi-modal structure in the posterior surface. Noise particularly impacts our sensitivity to the analysis settings and widths of the posterior distributions. The multi-modal structure in the posterior suggests that biases could be present if the analysis is unable to exhaustively explore the parameter space. Convergence testing, to ensure an adequate coverage of the parameter space and a suitable representation of the posterior distribution, is one possible solution to these challenges.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy rotation curve (RC) fitting is an important technique which allows the placement of constraints on different kinds of dark matter (DM) halo models. In the case of non-phenomenological DM profiles with no analytic expressions, the art of finding RC best-fits including the full baryonic $+$ DM free parameters can be difficult and time-consuming. In the present work, we use a gradient descent method used in the backpropagation process of training a neural network, to fit the so-called Grand Rotation Curve of the Milky Way (MW) ranging from $\sim$1 pc all the way to $\sim$$10^5$ pc. We model the mass distribution of our Galaxy including a bulge (inner $+$ main), a disk, and a fermionic dark matter (DM) halo known as the Ruffini-Arg\"uelles-Rueda (RAR) model. This is a semi-analytical model built from first-principle physics such as (quantum) statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, whose more general density profile has a dense core -- diluted halo morphology with no analytic expression. As shown recently and further verified here, the dark and compact fermion-core can work as an alternative to the central black hole in SgrA* when including data at milliparsec scales from the S-cluster stars. Thus, we show the ability of this state-of-the-art machine learning tool in providing the best-fit parameters to the overall MW RC in the $10^{-2}$--$10^5$ pc range, in a few hours of CPU time.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the simultaneous decay of global string loops into scalar particles (massless and massive modes) and gravitational waves (GWs). Using field theory simulations in flat space-time of %isolated loops with initial length $\sim 80-1700$ times their core width, we determine the power emitted by a loop into scalar particles, $P_{\varphi}$, and GWs, $P_{\rm GW}$, and characterize the loop-decay timescale as a function of its initial length, energy and angular momentum. We quantify infrared and ultraviolet lattice dependencies of our results. For all type of loops and initial conditions considered, GW emission is always suppressed compared to particles as $P_{\rm GW}/P_{\varphi} \approx \mathcal{O}(10)(v/m_\text{p})^2\ll 1$, where $v$ is the vacuum expectation value associated with string formation. Our results suggest that the GW background from a global string network, such as in dark matter axion scenarios, will be highly suppressed.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic archaeology represents a multidisciplinary approach aimed at unraveling the intricate history of the Milky Way galaxy through the study of its stellar populations. This abstract delves into the significance of galactic archaeology as a vital tool for understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. By examining the distribution, kinematics, chemical compositions, and ages of stars within the galaxy, researchers gain insights into the dynamic processes that have shaped its structure over billions of years. Stellar populations serve as invaluable relics of past epochs, preserving clues about the conditions prevalent during their formation. The utilization of spectroscopic and photometric data has enabled the classification and analysis of stars, allowing astronomers to discern distinct populations and unveil their origin stories. Through these studies, the emergence of the Milky Way's various components, such as the thin and thick disk, halo, and bulge, becomes discernible.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Upgrade will augment the existing IceCube Neutrino Observatory by deploying 700 additional optical sensor modules and calibration devices within its center at a depth of 1.5 to 2.5 km in the Antarctic ice. One goal of the Upgrade is to improve the positioning calibration of the optical sensors to increase the angular resolution for neutrino directional reconstruction. An acoustic calibration system will be deployed to explore the capability of achieving this using trilateration of propagation times of acoustic signals. Ten Acoustic Modules (AM) capable of sending and receiving acoustic signals with frequencies from 5 to 30 kHz will be installed within the detector volume. Additionally, compact acoustic sensors inside 15 optical sensor modules will complement the acoustic calibration system. With this system, we aim for an accuracy of a few tens of cm to localize the Acoustic Modules and sensors. Due to the longer attenuation length of sound compared to light within the ice, acoustic position calibration is especially interesting for the upcoming IceCube-Gen2 detector, which will have a string spacing of around 240 m. In this contribution we present an overview of the technical design of the Acoustic Module as well as results of performance tests with a first complete prototype.

 - **Abstract**
 The most conservative interpretation of the nHz stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) discovered by NANOGrav and other Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) Collaborations is astrophysical, namely that it originates from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. However, alternative cosmological models have been proposed, including cosmic strings, phase transitions, domain walls, primordial fluctuations and "audible" axions. We perform a multi-model analysis (MMA) to compare how well these different hypotheses fit the NANOGrav data, both in isolation and in combination with SMBH binaries, and address the questions: Which interpretations fit the data best, and which are disfavoured? We also discuss experimental signatures that can help discriminate between different sources of the PTA GW signal, including fluctuations in the signal strength between frequency bins, individual sources and how the PTA signal extends to higher frequencies.
