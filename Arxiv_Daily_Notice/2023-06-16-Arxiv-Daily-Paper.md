 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars die in catastrophic explosions, which seed the interstellar medium with heavy elements and produce neutron stars and black holes. Predictions of the explosion's character and the remnant mass depend on models of the star's evolutionary history. Models of massive star interiors can be empirically constrained by asteroseismic observations of gravity wave oscillations. Recent photometric observations reveal a ubiquitous red noise signal on massive main sequence stars; a hypothesized source of this noise is gravity waves driven by core convection. We present the first 3D simulations of massive star convection extending from the star's center to near its surface, with realistic stellar luminosities. Using these simulations, we make the first prediction of photometric variability due to convectively-driven gravity waves at the surfaces of massive stars, and find that gravity waves produce photometric variability of a lower amplitude and lower characteristic frequency than the observed red noise. We infer that the photometric signal of gravity waves excited by core convection is below the noise limit of current observations, so the red noise must be generated by an alternative process.

 - **Abstract**
 The next Milky Way supernova will be an epochal event in multi-messenger astronomy, critical to tests of supernovae, neutrinos, and new physics. Realizing this potential depends on having realistic simulations of core collapse. We investigate the neutrino predictions of nearly all modern models (1-, 2-, and 3-d) over the first $\simeq$1 s, making the first detailed comparisons of these models to each other and to the SN 1987A neutrino data. Even with different methods and inputs, the models generally agree with each other. However, even considering the low neutrino counts, the models generally disagree with data. What can cause this? We show that neither neutrino oscillations nor different progenitor masses appear to be a sufficient solution. We outline urgently needed work.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of a central baryonic potential can have a significant impact on the gravothermal evolution of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) haloes. We extend a semi-analytical fluid model to incorporate the influence of a static baryonic potential and calibrate it using controlled N-body simulations. We construct benchmark scenarios with varying baryon concentrations and different SIDM models, including constant and velocity-dependent self-interacting cross sections. The presence of the baryonic potential induces changes in SIDM halo properties, including central density, core size, and velocity dispersion, and it accelerates the halo's evolution in both expansion and collapse phases. Furthermore, we observe a quasi-universality in the gravothermal evolution of SIDM haloes with the baryonic potential, resembling a previously known feature in the absence of the baryons. By appropriately rescaling the physical quantities that characterize the SIDM haloes, the evolution of all our benchmark cases exhibits remarkable similarity. Our findings offer a framework for testing SIDM predictions using observations of galactic systems where baryons play a significant dynamical role.
#### Single-pulse analysis and average emission characteristics of PSR  J1820-0427 from observations made with the MWA and uGMRT

 - **Abstract**
 We have studied the pulse-to-pulse variability in PSR J1820--0427 and its frequency dependence using high-quality, wide-band observations made from the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT; 300-750 MHz) and the Murchison Widefield Array ($\sim$170-200 MHz). The low-frequency data reveal a previously unreported feature in the average profile (at 185 MHz) after accounting for the effects of temporal broadening arising from multi-path scattering due to the Interstellar Medium (ISM). We advance a new method for flux density calibration of beamformed data from the uGMRT and use it to measure the single pulse flux densities across the uGMRT band. Combined with previously published measurements, these flux densities are best fit with a power-law spectrum with a low-frequency turnover. We also use calibrated flux densities to explore the relationship between pulse-to-pulse variability and the spectral index of individual pulses. Our analysis reveals a large scatter in the single-pulse spectral indices and a general tendency for brighter pulses to show a steepening of the spectral index. We also examine the frequency-dependence of the pulse-fluence distribution and its relation to the Stochastic Growth Theory.

 - **Abstract**
 Young stellar populations provide a powerful record that traces millions of years of star formation history in the solar neighborhood. Using a revised form of the SPYGLASS young star identification methodology, we produce an expanded census of nearby young stars (Age $<50$ Myr). We then use the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm to produce a new SPYGLASS Catalog of Young Associations (SCYA), which reveals 116 young associations within 1 kpc. More than 25\% of these groups are largely new discoveries, as 20 are substantively different from any previous definition, and 10 have no equivalent in the literature. The new associations reveal a yet undiscovered demographic of small associations with little connection to larger structures. Some of the groups we identify are especially unique for their high transverse velocities, which can differ from the solar velocity by 30-50 km s$^{-1}$, and for their positions, which can reach up to 300 pc above the galactic plane. These features may suggest a unique origin, matching existing evidence of infalling gas parcels interacting with the disk ISM. Our clustering also suggests links between often-separated populations, hinting to direct structural connections between Orion Complex and Perseus OB2, and between the subregions of Vela. The $\sim$30 Myr old Cepheus-Hercules association is another emerging large-scale structure, with a size and population comparable to Sco-Cen. Cep-Her and other similarly-aged structures are also found clustered along extended structures perpendicular to known spiral arm structure, suggesting that arm-aligned star formation patterns have only recently become dominant in the solar neighborhood.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the radial and non-radial oscillations of Cross stars (CrSs), i.e., stars with a quark matter crust and a hadronic matter core in an inverted order compared to conventional hybrid stars. We draw comparisons of their oscillation modes with those of neutron stars, quark stars, and conventional hybrid stars. We find that the stellar stability analysis from the fundamental mode of radial oscillations, and the $g$, $f$ modes of non-radial oscillations are quite similar to those of conventional hybrid stars. However, due to the inverted stellar structure, the first non-radial $p$ mode of CrSs behaves in an inverted way and sits in a higher frequency domain compared to that of conventional hybrid stars. These results provide a direct way to discriminate CrSs from other types of compact stars via gravitational-wave probes. Specifically, compact stars emitting $g$-mode gravitational waves within the $0.5$--$1$ kHz range should be CrSs or conventional hybrid stars rather than neutron stars or pure quark stars, and a further GW detection of the first $p$ mode above 8 kHz or an identification of a decreasing trend of frequencies versus star masses associated with it will help identify the compact object to be a CrS rather than a conventional hybrid star.
#### On the intensity ratio variation of the Si IV 1394/1403 Å lines  during solar flares

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The Si IV lines at 1394 \r{A} and 1403 \r{A} form in the solar atmosphere at a temperature of $\sim10^{4.8}$ K. They are usually considered optically thin, but their opacity can be enhanced during solar flares. Traditionally, the intensity ratio of these lines are used as an indicator of the optical thickness. However, observations have shown a wavelength-dependent intensity ratio profile $r(\Delta\lambda)$ of the the 1394 \r{A} to 1403 \r{A} lines. Aims. We aim to study the variation of the intensity ratio profile in solar flares and the physical reasons behind it. Method. The Si IV lines and their intensity ratio profiles are calculated from the one-dimensional radiative hydrodynamics flare model with non-thermal electron heating. Result. During flares, $r(\Delta\lambda)$ is smaller than 2 at the line core but larger than 2 at the line wings. We attribute the deviation of the ratio from 2 to two effects: the resonance scattering effect and the opacity effect. Resonance scattering increases the population ratio of the upper levels of the two lines, and as a result, increases $r(\Delta\lambda)$, in all wavelengths. The opacity effect decreases $r(\Delta\lambda)$, especially at the line core where the opacity is larger. These two effects compete with each other and cause the U-shape of $r(\Delta\lambda)$.
#### Astrochemical models of interstellar ices: History matters

 - **Abstract**
 Ice is ubiquitous in the interstellar medium. We model the formation of the main constituents of interstellar ices, including H2O, CO2 , CO, and CH3 OH. We strive to understand what physical or chemical parameters influence the final composition of the ice and how they benchmark to what has already been observed, with the aim of applying these models to the preparation and analysis of JWST observations. We used the Nautilus gas-grain model, which computes the gas and ice composition as a function of time for a set of physical conditions, starting from an initial gas phase composition. All important processes (gas-phase reactions, gas-grain interactions, and grain surface processes) are included and solved with the rate equation approximation. We first ran an astrochemical code for fixed conditions of temperature and density mapped in the cold core L429-C to benchmark the chemistry. One key parameter was revealed to be the dust temperature. When the dust temperature is higher than 12 K, CO2 will form efficiently at the expense of H2O, while at temperatures below 12 K, it will not form. Whatever hypothesis we assumed for the chemistry (within realistic conditions), the static simulations failed to reproduce the observed trends of interstellar ices in our target core. In a second step, we simulated the chemical evolution of parcels of gas undergoing different physical and chemical situations throughout the molecular cloud evolution and starting a few 1e7 yr prior to the core formation (dynamical simulations). Our dynamical simulations satisfactorily reproduce the main trends already observed for interstellar ices. Moreover, we predict that the apparent constant ratio of CO2/H2O observed to date is probably not true for regions of low AV , and that the history of the evolution of clouds plays an essential role, even prior to their formation.

 - **Abstract**
 With the greater power to infer the state of stellar interiors provided by asteroseismology, it has become possible to study the survival of initially convective cores within stars during their main-sequence evolution. Standard theories of stellar evolution predict that convective cores in sub-solar mass stars have lifetimes below 1 Gyr. However, a recent asteroseismic study of the star Kepler-444 concluded that the initial convective core had survived for nearly 8 Gyr. The goal of this paper is to study the convective-core evolution of Kepler-444 and to investigate its proposed longevity. We modify the input physics of stellar models to induce longer convective-core lifetimes and vary the associated parameter across a dense grid of evolutionary tracks. The observations of metallicity, effective temperature, mean density, and asteroseismic frequency ratios are fitted to the models using the BASTA pipeline. We explore different choices of constraints, from which a long convective-core lifetime is only recovered for a few specific combinations: mainly from the inclusion of potentially unreliable frequencies and/or excluding the covariances between the frequency ratios; while for the classical parameters, the derived luminosity has the largest influence. For all choices of observables, our analysis reliably constrains the convective-core lifetime of Kepler-444 to be short, with a median around 0.6 Gyr and a $1\sigma$ upper bound around 3.5 Gyr.

 - **Abstract**
 The abundance of refractory elements in giant planets can provide key insights into their formation histories. Due to the Solar System giants' low temperatures, refractory elements condense below the cloud deck limiting sensing capabilities to only highly volatile elements. Recently, ultra-hot giant exoplanets have allowed for some refractory elements to be measured showing abundances broadly consistent with the solar nebula with titanium likely condensed out of the photosphere. Here we report precise abundance constraints of 14 major refractory elements on the ultra-hot giant planet WASP-76b that show distinct deviations from proto-solar, and a sharp onset in condensation temperature. In particular, we find nickel to be enriched, a possible sign of the accretion of a differentiated object's core during the planet's evolution. Elements with condensation temperatures below 1,550 K otherwise closely match those of the Sun before sharply transitioning to being strongly depleted above 1,550 K, well explained by nightside cold-trapping. We further unambiguously detect vanadium oxide on WASP-76b, a molecule long hypothesized to drive atmospheric thermal inversions, and also observe a global east-west asymmetry in its absorption signals. Overall, our findings indicate that giant planets have a mostly stellar-like refractory elemental content and suggest that temperature sequences of hot Jupiter spectra can show abrupt transitions wherein a mineral species is either present, or completely absent if a cold-trap exists below its condensation temperature.
#### ExoMDN: Rapid characterization of exoplanet interior structures with  Mixture Density Networks

 - **Abstract**
 Characterizing the interior structure of exoplanets is essential for understanding their diversity, formation, and evolution. As the interior of exoplanets is inaccessible to observations, an inverse problem must be solved, where numerical structure models need to conform to observable parameters such as mass and radius. This is a highly degenerate problem whose solution often relies on computationally-expensive and time-consuming inference methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo. We present ExoMDN, a machine-learning model for the interior characterization of exoplanets based on Mixture Density Networks (MDN). The model is trained on a large dataset of more than 5.6 million synthetic planets below 25 Earth masses consisting of an iron core, a silicate mantle, a water and high-pressure ice layer, and a H/He atmosphere. We employ log-ratio transformations to convert the interior structure data into a form that the MDN can easily handle. Given mass, radius, and equilibrium temperature, we show that ExoMDN can deliver a full posterior distribution of mass fractions and thicknesses of each planetary layer in under a second on a standard Intel i5 CPU. Observational uncertainties can be easily accounted for through repeated predictions from within the uncertainties. We use ExoMDN to characterize the interior of 22 confirmed exoplanets with mass and radius uncertainties below 10% and 5% respectively, including the well studied GJ 1214 b, GJ 486 b, and the TRAPPIST-1 planets. We discuss the inclusion of the fluid Love number $k_2$ as an additional (potential) observable, showing how it can significantly reduce the degeneracy of interior structures. Utilizing the fast predictions of ExoMDN, we show that measuring $k_2$ with an accuracy of 10% can constrain the thickness of core and mantle of an Earth analog to $\approx13\%$ of the true values.
#### Exploring Stellar Cluster and Feedback-driven Star Formation in Galactic  Mid-infrared Bubble [HKS2019] E70

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the Galactic mid-infrared (MIR) bubble [HKS2019] E70 (E70) by adopting a multi-wavelength approach to understand the physical environment and star formation scenario around it. We identified a small (radius ~1.7 pc) stellar clustering inside the E70 bubble and its distance is estimated as 3.26 +/- 0.45 kpc. This cluster is embedded in the molecular cloud and hosts massive stars as well as young stellar objects (YSOs), suggesting active star formation in the region. The spectral type of the brightest star 'M1' of the E70 cluster is estimated as O9V and a circular ring/shell of gas and dust is found around it. The diffuse radio emission inside this ring/shell, the excess pressure exerted by the massive star 'M1' at the YSOs core, and the distribution of photo-dissociation regions (PDRs), a Class I YSO, and two ultra-compact (UC) H II regions on the rim of this ring/shell, clearly suggest positive feedback of the massive star 'M1' in the region. We also found a low-density shell-like structure in 12 CO(J=1-0) molecular emission along the perimeter of the E70 bubble. The velocity structure of the 12 CO emission suggests that the feedback from the massive star appears to have expelled the molecular material and subsequent swept-up material is what appears as the E70 bubble.

 - **Abstract**
 Many molecules observed in the interstellar medium are thought to result from thermal desorption of ices. Parameters such as desorption energy and pre-exponential frequency factor are essential to describe the desorption of molecules. Experimental determinations of these parameters are missing for many molecules, including those found in the interstellar medium. The objective of this work is to expand the number of molecules for which desorption parameters are available, by collecting and re-analysing experimental temperature programmed desorption data that are present in the literature. Transition State Theory (TST) is used in combination with the Redhead equation to determine desorption parameters. Experimental data and molecular constants (e.g., mass, moment of inertia) are collected and given as input. Using the Redhead-TST method, the desorption parameters for 133 molecules have been determined. The Redhead-TST method is found to provide reliable results that agree well with desorption parameters determined with more rigorous experimental methods. The importance of using accurately determined pre-exponential frequency factors to simulate desorption profiles is emphasised. The large amount of data allows to look for trends, the most important is the relationship log$_{10}$($\nu$) = 2.65ln($m$) + 8.07, where $\nu$ is the pre-exponential frequency factor and $m$ the mass of the molecule. The data collected in this work allow to model the thermal desorption of molecules and help understand changes in chemical and elemental composition of interstellar environments.
#### Decoding the age-chemical structure of the Milky Way disk: An  application of Copulas and Elicitable Maps

 - **Abstract**
 In the Milky Way, the distribution of stars in the $[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]$ vs. $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]$ and $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]$ vs. age planes holds essential information about the history of star formation, accretion, and dynamical evolution of the Galactic disk. We investigate these planes by applying novel statistical methods called copulas and elicitable maps to the ages and abundances of red giants in the APOGEE survey. We find that the low- and high-$\alpha$ disk stars have a clean separation in copula space and use this to provide an automated separation of the $\alpha$ sequences using a purely statistical approach. This separation reveals that the high-$\alpha$ disk ends at the same [$\alpha$/Fe] and age at high $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]$ as the low-$[\mathrm{Fe/H}]$ start of the low-$\alpha$ disk, thus supporting a sequential formation scenario for the high- and low-$\alpha$ disks. We then combine copulas with elicitable maps to precisely obtain the correlation between stellar age $\tau$ and metallicity $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]$ conditional on Galactocentric radius $R$ and height $z$ in the range $0 < R < 20$ kpc and $|z| < 2$ kpc. The resulting trends in the age-metallicity correlation with radius, height, and [$\alpha$/Fe] demonstrate a $\approx 0$ correlation wherever kinematically-cold orbits dominate, while the naively-expected negative correlation is present where kinematically-hot orbits dominate. This is consistent with the effects of spiral-driven radial migration, which must be strong enough to completely flatten the age-metallicity structure of the low-$\alpha$ disk.
