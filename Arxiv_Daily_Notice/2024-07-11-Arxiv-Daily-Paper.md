#### Title:
          Do SETI Optimists Have a Fine-Tuning Problem?

 - **Abstract**
 In ecological systems, be it a garden or a galaxy, populations evolve from some initial value (say zero) up to a steady state equilibrium, when the mean number of births and deaths per unit time are equal. This equilibrium point is a function of the birth and death rates, as well as the carrying capacity of the ecological system itself. The growth curve is S-shaped, saturating at the carrying capacity for large birth-to-death rate ratios and tending to zero at the other end. We argue that our astronomical observations appear inconsistent with a cosmos saturated with ETIs, and thus SETI optimists are left presuming that the true population is somewhere along the transitional part of this S-curve. Since the birth and death rates are a-priori unbounded, we argue that this presents a fine-tuning problem. Further, we show that if the birth-to-death rate ratio is assumed to have a log-uniform prior distribution, then the probability distribution of the ecological filling fraction is bi-modal - peaking at zero and unity. Indeed, the resulting distribution is formally the classic Haldane prior, conceived to describe the prior expectation of a Bernoulli experiment, such as a technological intelligence developing (or not) on a given world. Our results formally connect the Drake Equation to the birth-death formalism, the treatment of ecological carrying capacity and their connection to the Haldane perspective.

 - **Abstract**
 The observation of neutron stars enables the otherwise impossible study of fundamental physical processes. Timing of binary radio pulsars is particularly powerful, as it enables precise characterization of their (three-dimensional) positions and orbits. PSR J0437$-$4715 is an important millisecond pulsar for timing array experiments and is also a primary target for the Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER). The main aim of the NICER mission is to constrain the neutron star equation of state by inferring the compactness ($M_p/R$) of the star. Direct measurements of the mass $M_p$ from pulsar timing therefore substantially improve constraints on the radius $R$, and the equation of state. Here we use observations spanning 26 years from Murriyang, the 64-m Parkes radio telescope, to improve the timing model for this pulsar. Among the new precise measurements are the pulsar mass $M_p=1.418\pm 0.044$ M$_{\odot}$, distance $D=156.96 \pm 0.11$ pc, and orbital inclination angle $i=137.506 \pm 0.016^\circ$, which can be used to inform the X-ray pulse profile models inferred from NICER observations. We demonstrate that these results are consistent between multiple data sets from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), each modelled with different noise assumptions. Using the longest available PPTA data set, we measure an apparent second derivative of the pulsar spin frequency and discuss how this can be explained either by kinematic effects due to the proper motion and radial velocity of the pulsar, or excess low-frequency noise such as a gravitational-wave background.

          Disrupted Wide Binaries as Dynamical Probes of Galactic Structure

 - **Abstract**
 Many of the stars in the Galaxy were formed in binary systems. The widest of these can eventually become disrupted due to a combination of kicks from passing stars and the Galactic tidal field. If the Galactic disk were purely axisymmetric, the stars from a disrupted binary system would slowly drift apart on nearly identical orbits. We study how the existence of non-axisymmetric structures, such as a rigidly rotating bar, can greatly alter this picture. In particular, we show how the orbital dynamics near the resonances sourced by these perturbations can create local fluctuations in the distribution of disrupted binary separations. We simulate the evolution of wide binary systems embedded in gravitational potentials with rotating galactic bars, and show how features and fluctuations in the distribution of disrupted binaries can be used to locate bar resonances and constrain the bar's pattern speed and amplitude.

          Hierarchical Three-Body Problem at High Eccentricities = Simple Pendulum

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 The gradual evolution of the restricted hierarchical three body problem is analyzed analytically, focusing on conditions of Kozai-Lidov Cycles that may lead to orbital flips from prograde to retrograde motion due to the octupole (third order) term which are associated with extremely high eccentricities. We revisit the approach described by Katz, Dong and Malhotra (\href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 181101 (2011)}) and show that for most initial conditions, to an excellent approximation, the analytic derivation can be greatly simplified and reduces to a simple pendulum model allowing an explicit flip criterion. The resulting flip criterion is much simpler than the previous one but the latter is still needed in a small fraction of phase space. We identify a logical error in the earlier derivation but clarify why it does not affect the final results.

          Exploring a primordial solution for early black holes detected with the JWST

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unearthed black holes as massive as $10^{6.2-8.1}M_\odot$ at redshifts of $z \sim 8.5-10.6$ with many systems showing unexpectedly high black hole to stellar mass ratios >=30%, posing a crucial challenge for theoretical models. Using analytic calculations, we explore the combination of {\it astrophysical} seeding mechanisms and Eddington accretion rates that can explain the observed objects. We then appeal to {\it cosmological} primordial black hole (PBH) seeds and show how these present an alternative path for "seeding" early structures and their baryonic contents. Assuming seeding (via astrophysical means) at a redshift of $z_{\rm seed}=25$ and continuous accretion, all of the black holes studied here can either be explained through super-Eddington accretion (at an Eddington fraction of $f_{\rm Edd}<= 2.1 $) onto low-mass ($100M_\odot$) seeds or Eddington-limited accretion onto high-mass ($10^5 M_\odot$) seeds. The upper limit, where we assume a primordial origin for all of these black holes, yields a continuous primordial black hole mass function (between $10^{-5.25}$ and $10^{3.75} M_\odot$) and a fractional PBH value $<= 10^{-12}$, in good agreement with observational constraints. Starting at the redshift of matter-radiation equality ($z \sim 3400$), we show how PBH-driven structure formation can reproduce the observed stellar and black hole masses for two of the highest redshift black holes (UHZ1 and GHZ9 at $z \sim 10.3$) with the same parameters governing star formation, black hole accretion and their feedbacks. Exploring a wide swathe of model parameter space for GHZ9, we find black hole-to-stellar mass ratios ranging between $0.1-1.86$ i.e. in some cases (of high supernova feedback), the black hole grows to be more massive than its host halo, presenting an attractive alternative to seeding these puzzling early systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of TOI 762 A b and TIC 46432937 b, two giant planets transiting M dwarf stars. Transits of both systems were first detected from observations by the NASA TESS mission, and the transiting objects are confirmed as planets through high-precision radial velocity (RV) observations carried out with VLT/ESPRESSO. TOI 762 A b is a warm sub-Saturn with a mass of 0.251 +- 0.042 M_J, a radius of 0.744 +- 0.017 R_J, and an orbital period of 3.4717 d. It transits a mid-M dwarf star with a mass of 0.442 +- 0.025 M_S and a radius of 0.4250 +- 0.0091 R_S. The star TOI 762 A has a resolved binary star companion TOI 762 B that is separated from TOI 762 A by 3.2" (~ 319 AU) and has an estimated mass of 0.227 +- 0.010 M_S. The planet TIC 46432937 b is a warm Super-Jupiter with a mass of 3.20 +- 0.11 M_J and radius of 1.188 +- 0.030 R_J. The planet's orbital period is P = 1.4404 d, and it undergoes grazing transits of its early M dwarf host star, which has a mass of 0.563 +- 0.029 M_S and a radius of 0.5299 +- 0.0091 R_S. TIC 46432937 b is one of the highest mass planets found to date transiting an M dwarf star. TIC 46432937 b is also a promising target for atmospheric observations, having the highest Transmission Spectroscopy Metric or Emission Spectroscopy Metric value of any known warm Super-Jupiter (mass greater than 3.0 M_J, equilibrium temperature below 1000 K).

          The Maximum Black Hole Mass at Solar Metallicity

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse current knowledge and uncertainties in detailed stellar evolution and wind modelling to evaluate the mass of the most massive stellar black hole (BH) at solar metallicity. Contrary to common expectations that it is the most massive stars that would produce the most massive BHs, we find that the maximum $M_{\rm BH}^{\rm Max} \simeq 30 \pm 10\,M_{\odot}$ is found in the canonical intermediate range between $M_{\rm ZAMS} \simeq 30$ and $50\,M_{\odot}$ instead. The prime reason for this seemingly counter-intuitive finding is that very massive stars (VMS) have increasingly high mass-loss rates, leading to substantial mass evaporation before they expire as stars, ending as lighter BHs than their canonical O-star counterparts.

 - **Abstract**
 Adaptive optics systems are usually prototyped in a convenient but slow language like MATLAB or Python, and then re-written from scratch using high-performance C/C++ to perform real-time control. This duplication of effort adds costs and slows the experimentation process. We present instead a technical demonstration of performing real time, sub-millisecond latency control with an adaptive optics system using the high-level Julia programming language. This open-source software demonstrates support for multiple cameras, pixel streaming, and network-transparency distributed computing. Furthermore, it is easy to interface it with other programming languages as desired.

 - **Abstract**
 Starlight suppression techniques for High-Contrast Imaging (HCI) are crucial to achieving the demanding contrast ratios and inner working angles required for detecting and characterizing exoplanets with a wide range of masses and separations. The advent of photonic technologies provides new opportunities to control the amplitude and phase characteristics of light, with the potential to enhance and control starlight suppression. Here, we present a focal plane optical-fiber-based nulling interferometer working with commercially available components for amplitude and phase modulation. The instrument implements single-mode fiber-coupled elements: a MEMS variable optical attenuator (VOA) matches the on-axis and off-axis starlight amplitude, while a piezoelectric-driven fiber stretcher modifies the optical path difference between the channels to achieve the $\pi$ phase shift condition for destructive interference. We show preliminary lab results using a narrowband light source working at 632 nm and discuss future opportunities for testing on-sky with the Astrophotonics Advancement Platform at Lick Observatory (APALO) at the Shane 3-m Telescope.

          A kinematical study of the launching region of the blueshifted HH 46/47 outflow with SINFONI K-band observations

 - **Abstract**
 Studying outflows is important as they may significantly contribute to angular momentum removal from the star/disk system, affecting disk evolution and planet formation. To investigate the different outflow components; the collimated jet, wide-angled molecular outflow, and outflow cavity, of the Class I HH 46/47 outflow system. We focus on their kinematics. We present Near Infrared (NIR) K-band integral field observations of the blue-shifted HH 46/47 outflow base obtained using VLT/SINFONI with an angular resolution of 0".81. Our analysis focuses on [Fe II], H2 1-0 S(1), and, Br-gamma emission. We employ a wavelength recalibration technique based on OH telluric lines to probe the kinematics of the wide-angled flow with an accuracy of 1 km/s - 3 km/s. A velocity gradient of 10 km/s transverse to the outflow direction is confirmed in the wide-angled H2 outflow cavity. The H2 cavity peaks at radial velocities of -15 km/s to -30 km/s, and the atomic jet at v = -210 km/s. The outflow exhibits a layered structure; the high-velocity [Fe II] and Br-gamma jet is surrounded by a wide-angled H2 outflow cavity, which is in turn nested within the continuum emission and CO molecular outflow. The continuum emission and H2 outflow cavity are asymmetric with respect to the jet axis. We propose that the origin of the asymmetries and the velocity gradient detected in the wide-angled H2 cavity, is due to a wide-angled outflow or successive jet bowshocks expanding into an inhomogeneous ambient medium, or the presence of a secondary outflow. We eliminate outflow rotation as an exclusive origin of this velocity gradient due to large specific angular momenta values, J(r)= 3000 - 4000 km/s au calculated from 1" to 2" along the outflow. The observations reveal the complexities inherent in outflow systems, and the risk of attributing transverse velocity gradients solely to rotation.

          Chemistry in the GG Tau A Disk: Constraints from H2D+, N2H+, and DCO+ High Angular Resolution ALMA Observations

 - **Abstract**
 Resolved molecular line observations are essential for gaining insight into the physical and chemical structure of protoplanetary disks, particularly in cold, dense regions where planets form and acquire compositions. However, tracing these regions is challenging because most molecules freeze onto grain surfaces and are not observable in the gas phase. We investigated cold molecular chemistry in the triple stellar T Tauri disk GG Tau A, which harbours a massive gas and dust ring and an outer disk, using ALMA Band 7 observations. We present high angular resolution maps of N2H+ and DCO+ emission, with upper limits reported for H2D+, 13CS, and SO2. The radial intensity profile of N2H+ shows most emission near the ring outer edge, while DCO+ exhibits double peaks, one near the ring inner edge and the other in the outer disk. With complementary observations of lower-lying transitions, we constrained the molecular surface densities and rotation temperatures. We compared the derived quantities with model predictions across different cosmic ray ionization (CRI) rates, carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios, and stellar UV fluxes. Cold molecular chemistry, affecting N2H+, DCO+, and H2D+ abundances, is most sensitive to CRI rates, while stellar UV flux and C/O ratios have minimal impact on these three ions. Our best model requires a low cosmic ray ionization rate of 1e-18 s-1. However, it fails to match the low temperatures derived from N2H+ and DCO+, 12 to 16 K, which are much lower than the CO freezing temperature.

          Viscous circumbinary protoplanetary discs -- I. Structure of the inner cavity

 - **Abstract**
 Many of the most intriguing features, including spirals and cavities, in the current disc observations are found in binary systems like GG Tau, HD 142527 or HD 100453. Such features are evidence of the dynamic interaction between binary stars and the viscous disc. Understanding these dynamic interactions and how they result in the structure and growth of asymmetric circumbinary discs is a difficult problem, for which there is no complete analytical solution, that predicts the shape of the observed disc accurately. We use numeric simulation to evolve circumbinary discs with varying disc viscosities and investigate the size and shape of the inner cavities in such protoplanetary discs. We have simulated over 140 locally isothermal 2D grid-based disc models for > 3e4 binary orbits each and mapped out the parameter space relevant for protoplanetary discs. With this, it becomes possible to create parametrised profiles for individual discs to compare to observation and find limits to their binary eccentricity or internal viscosity from the simulation data. In the long-term simulations larger cavity sizes than previously considered are possible within the parameter space (< 6 binary separations). As an example, we find that the eccentricity of the disc around HD 142527 suggests the impact of the binary dynamics on the disc. However, even considering the larger cavity sizes, the large size of the cavity in HD 142527 remains unexplained by the simulations considering the most recent orbital constraints.

          Characterisation of Supernovae Interacting with Dense Circumstellar Matter with a Flat Density Profile

 - **Abstract**
 Interaction between supernova (SN) ejecta and dense circumstellar medium (CSM) with a flat density structure ($\rho \propto r^{-s}, s < 1.5$) was recently proposed as a possible mechanism behind interacting SNe that exhibit exceptionally long rise times exceeding 100 days. In such a configuration, the interaction luminosity keeps rising until the reverse shock propagates into the inner layers of the SN ejecta. We investigate the light curves of SNe interacting with a flatly distributed CSM in detail, incorporating the effects of photon diffusion inside the CSM into the model. We show that three physical processes - the shock breakout, the propagation of the reverse shock into the inner ejecta, and the departure of the shock from the dense CSM - predominantly determine the qualitative behaviour of the light curves. Based on the presence and precedence of these processes, the light curves of SNe interacting with flatly distributed CSM can be classified into five distinct morphological classes. We also show that our model can qualitatively reproduce doubly peaked SNe whose peaks are a few tens of days apart, such as SN 2005bf and SN 2022xxf. Our results show that the density distribution of the CSM is an important property of CSM that contributes to the diversity in light curves of interacting SNe.

          Constraints on Relativistic Jets from the Fast X-ray Transient 210423 using Prompt Radio Follow-Up Observations

 - **Abstract**
 Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) are a new observational class of phenomena with no clear physical origin. This is at least partially a consequence of limited multi-wavelength follow up of this class of transients in real time. Here we present deep optical ($g-$ and $i-$ band) photometry with Keck, and prompt radio observations with the VLA of FXT 210423 obtained at ${\delta t \approx 14-36}$ days since the X-ray trigger. We use these multi-band observations, combined with publicly available data sets, to constrain the presence and physical properties of on-axis and off-axis relativistic jets such as those that can be launched by neutron-star mergers and tidal disruption events, which are among the proposed theoretical scenarios of FXTs. Considering a wide range of possible redshifts $z\le3.5$, circumstellar medium (CSM) density $n={10^{-6}-10^{-1}\,\rm{cm^{-3}}}$, isotropic-equivalent jet kinetic energy $E_{k,iso}={10^{48}-10^{55}\,\rm{erg}}$, we find that we can rule out wide jets with opening angle ${\theta_{j}=15^{\circ}}$ viewed within ${10^{\circ}}$ off-axis. For more collimated jets (${\theta_{j}=3^{\circ}}$) we can only rule out on-axis (${\theta_{j}=0^{\circ}}$) orientations. This study highlights the constraining power of prompt multi-wavelength observations of FXTs discovered in real time by current (e.g., Einstein Probe) and future facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Analyzing all 120 s and 20 s light curves obtained by the TESS satellite up to Sector 69 - the end of the fifth year of observations - for all known white dwarfs and white dwarf candidates up to G=17.5 mag, we report the discovery of 32 new pulsating DA white dwarf stars. For all objects, we obtained the period spectra and performed a seismological analysis using full evolutionary models to estimate the structural parameters, such as effective temperature, stellar mass, and hydrogen envelope mass. The median stellar mass for the pulsators from asteroseismology is 0.609 Msun, in agreement with the median value from photometric and spectroscopic determinations, 0.602 Msun, excluding the low and extremely-low mass objects. Finally, we found rotational-splitting multiplets for 9 stars, which led to rotation periods between 4 h and 1 d.

          The [Y/Mg] chemical clock in the Galactic Disk: The influence of metallicity and Galactic population in the solar neighbourhood

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar ages are an important parameter to study the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. In recent years, several studies have established the existence of a relationship between chemical clocks and stellar ages. The [Y/Mg] clock is a promising technique, but there are still several open questions, such as its validity for metal-poor stars and differences between the thin and thick disk populations. Our aim is to study the behaviour of the [Y/Mg] chemical clock with stellar ages and the effect of metallicity and population on this chemical clock for a sample of solar-type disk stars. We have derived the precise stellar atmospheric parameters as well as the elemental abundances of Mg and Y through line-by-line differential spectroscopic analysis for a sample of 48 metal-poor solar-type stars based on high-quality, high-resolution ESO/HARPS spectra. From the high-precision Gaia astrometric data, stellar masses and ages were estimated through isochrone-fitting. A joint analysis of our sample, together with a sample of 185 solar-twins and analogues from our previous works, is performed to calibrate the [Y/Mg] chemical clock in the Galactic disk for $-$0.71 $\leq$ [Fe/H] $<$ +0.34. Open clusters and stars with asteroseismic ages have been used to validate our relations. Two different populations could be clearly seen in the [Mg/Fe] - [Fe/H] plane - the thick and thin disks. We found a metallicity-dependent, strong anti-correlation between the [Y/Mg] ratio and stellar ages of our sample. For the first time in the literature, we report similar correlations for the thin and thick disk stars. The [Y/Mg] relation(s) found here for solar-type stars is compatible with the literature using solar-twins. Our relation provides higher accuracy and precision of 0.45 and 0.99 Gyr, respectively, comparable with the best accuracy achieved for the solar-twins till date.

          Coordinated JWST Imaging of Three Distance Indicators in a SN Host Galaxy and an Estimate of the TRGB Color Dependence

 - **Abstract**
 Boasting a 6.5m mirror in space, JWST can increase by several times the number of supernovae (SNe) to which a redshift-independent distance has been measured with a precision distance indicator (e.g., TRGB or Cepheids); the limited number of such SN calibrators currently dominates the uncertainty budget in distance ladder Hubble constant (H0) experiments. JWST/NIRCAM imaging of the Virgo Cluster galaxy NGC4536 is used here to preview JWST program GO-1995, which aims to measure H0 using three stellar distance indicators (Cepheids, TRGB, JAGB/carbon stars). Each population of distance indicator was here successfully detected -- with sufficiently large number statistics, well-measured fluxes, and characteristic distributions consistent with ingoing expectations -- so as to confirm that we can acquire distances from each method precise to about 0.05mag (statistical uncertainty only). We leverage overlapping HST imaging to identify TRGB stars, cross-match them with the JWST photometry, and present a preliminary constraint on the slope of the TRGB's F115W-(F115W}-F444W) relation equal to -0.99 +/- 0.16 mag/mag. This slope is consistent with prior slope measurements in the similar 2MASS J-band, as well as with predictions from the BASTI isochrone suite. We use the new TRGB slope estimate to flatten the two-dimensional TRGB feature and measure a (blinded) TRGB distance relative to a set of fiducial TRGB colors, intended to represent the absolute fiducial calibrations expected from geometric anchors such as NGC4258 and the Magellanic Clouds. In doing so, we empirically demonstrate that the TRGB can be used as a standardizable candle at the IR wavelengths accessible with JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), aimed at detecting gravitational waves (GWs) in the $1\sim 100$ nHz range, have recently made significant strides. Compelling evidence has emerged for a common spectrum signal spatially correlated among pulsars, following a Hellings-Downs (HD) pattern, which is crucial for detecting a gravitational-wave background (GWB). However, the HD curve is expected for discrete and non-interfering sources, which is unlikely to hold in realistic scenarios with potential interference among numerous GW sources, such as the supermassive black-hole binaries. Incorporating interference was previously expected to introduce an irreducible uncertainty (known as "cosmic variance") in discerning the HD correlation; however, our work reveals how this interference generates measurable frequency-dependent spatial correlations distinct from the HD curve. The spatial correlations for interfering sources (referred to as "ISC") still exhibit contributions in the quadrupole and higher orders, resembling the HD correlation and encoding the nature of GW radiations. We apply these novel correlations to search for a GWB in the NANOGrav 15-year data set. In an optimistic estimation, our findings show a Bayes factor of $33.7\pm 3.2$ comparing ISC to the HD correlation, and an improvement in optimal statistic signal-to-noise ratio from $4.9\pm 1.1$ for the HD correlation to $6.6\pm 1.7$ for the ISC, highlighting the significant enhancement in evidence for detecting a GWB through incorporating interference.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars in the Galactic disk are born on cold, nearly circular orbits with small vertical excursions. After their birth, their orbits evolve, driven by small- or large-scale perturbations in the Galactic disk's gravitational potential. Here, we study the vertical motions of young stars over their first few orbital periods, using a sample of OBA stars from \textit{Gaia} E/DR3, which includes radial velocities and ages $\tau$ from LAMOST. We constructed a parametric model for the time evolution of the stellar orbits' mean vertical actions $J_z$ as a function of Galactocentric radius, $R_{\mathrm{GC}}$. Accounting for data uncertainties, we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis in annuli of Galactocentric radius to constrain the model parameters. Our best-fit model shows a remarkably linear increase of vertical actions with age across all Galactocentric radii examined. Orbital \textit{heating} by random scattering could offer a straightforward interpretation for this trend. However, various other dynamical aspects of the Galactic disk, such as stars being born in a warped disk, might offer alternative explanations that could be tested in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the H$41\alpha$ recombination line to create templates of the millimeter free-free emission in the ALMA-IMF continuum maps, which allows to separate it from dust emission. This method complements spectral-index information and extrapolation from centimeter wavelength maps. We use the derived maps to estimate the properties of up to 34 HII regions across the ALMA-IMF protoclusters. The hydrogen ionizing-photon rate $Q_0$ and spectral types follow the evolutionary trend proposed by Motte et al. The youngest protoclusters lack detectable ionized gas, followed by protoclusters with increasing numbers of OB stars. The total $Q_0$ increases from $\sim 10^{45}$ s$^{-1}$ to $> 10^{49}$ s$^{-1}$. We used the adjacent He$41\alpha$ line to measure the relative number abundances of helium, finding values consistent with the Galactic interstellar medium, although a few outliers are discussed. A search for sites of maser amplification of the H$41\alpha$ line returned negative results. We looked for possible correlations between the electron densities ($n_e$), emission measures (EM), and $Q_0$ with HII region size $D$. The latter are the better correlated, with $Q_0 \propto D^{2.49\pm0.18}$. This favors interpretations where smaller ultracompact HII regions are not necessarily the less dynamically evolved versions of larger ones, but rather are ionized by less massive stars. Moderate correlations were found between dynamical width $\Delta V_\mathrm{dyn}$ with $D$ and $Q_0$. $\Delta V_\mathrm{dyn}$ increases from about one to two times the ionized-gas sound speed. Finally, an outlier HII region south of W43-MM2 is discussed. We suggest that this source could harbor an embedded stellar or disk wind.

 - **Abstract**
 A sufficiently precise measurement of black hole spin is required to carry out quantitative tests of the Kerr metric and to understand several phenomena related to astrophysical black holes. After 24 years, XTE J2012+381 again underwent an outburst in December 2022. In this work, we focused on the measurement of spin and mass of black hole candidate XTE J2012+381 using broadband spectral analysis of X-ray data from \emph{Swift/XRT} and \emph{NuSTAR}. By using the relxillCp model, the spin and inclination of the source were found to be $0.883_{-0.061}^{+0.033}$ and $46.2_{-2.0}^{+3.7}$ degrees, respectively for high disk density ($i.e.\;10^{20}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$). We further test our results for lamp post geometry using the relxilllpCp model. The spin and inclination of the source were found to be $0.892_{-0.044}^{+0.020}$ and $43.1_{-1.2}^{+1.4}$ degrees, respectively. Then "continuum-fitting" method was used for the soft state to estimate the mass of BH and found to be $7.95_{-3.25}^{+7.65}\;\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and $7.48_{-2.75}^{+5.80}\;\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ for the spin and inclination estimated from the relxillCp and relxilllpCp model respectively. We used a distance of 5.4 kpc as measured by Gaia using the parallax method. This study also addresses the issue of supersolar iron abundance in XTE J2012+381 by using \texttt{reflionx} based reflection model and found high disk density for the source.

 - **Abstract**
 A rare subclass of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), named after the prototype SN 2003fg, includes some of the brightest SNe Ia, often called "super Chandrasekhar-mass" SNe Ia. We calculate the $\gamma$-ray deposition histories and the $^{56}$Ni mass synthesized in the explosion, $M_\mathrm{Ni56}$, for eight 2003fg-like SNe. Our findings reveal that the $\gamma$-ray escape time, $t_0$, for these objects is $ t_0\approx45\text{-}60 \,$ days, significantly higher than that of normal SNe Ia. 2003fg-like SNe are distinct from normal SNe Ia in the $ t_0 $-$ M_\mathrm{Ni56} $ plane, with a noticeable gap between the two populations. The observed position of 2003fg-like SNe in this plane poses a significant challenge for theoretical explosion models. We demonstrate that the merger of two white dwarfs (WDs) and a single star exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit fail to reproduce the observed $ t_0 $-$ M_\mathrm{Ni56} $ distribution. However, preliminary calculations of head-on collisions of massive WDs show agreement with the observed $ t_0 $-$ M_\mathrm{Ni56} $ distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first detection in space of 1,4-pentadiyne. It has been found towards TMC-1 with the QUIJOTE line survey in the 31-50 GHz range. We observed a total of 17 transitions with J = 2 up to 13 and Ka = 0, 1 and 2. The observed transitions allowed us to derive a rotational temperature of 9.5 +- 0.5 K and a column density of (5.0 +- 0.5) x 10^12 cm-2. This molecule was the last non-cyclic isomer of the C5H4 family that could be detected via radio astronomy. A computational chemistry study was performed to determine the energies of the five most stable isomers. The isomer (c-C3H3CCH) has a considerably higher energy than the others, and it has not yet been detected. To better understand the chemical reactions involving these species, we compared the ethynyl and cyano derivatives. The observed abundances of these species are in good agreement with the branching ratios of the formation reactions studied with our chemical model of TMC-1.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays are energetic nuclei that permeate the entire Galactic disk. Their existence requires the presence of powerful particle accelerators. While Galactic supernova explosions may supply the required energy, there is growing evidence that they cannot explain all of the observed properties of cosmic rays, such as their maximum particle energy and isotopic composition. Among Galactic objects, winds from stellar clusters meet the energetic requirement and provide a suitable environment for particle acceleration. The recent detection of some of these objects in gamma rays confirms that they indeed harbor high-energy particles.However, as most supernovae explode inside stellar clusters, it is difficult to distinguish the contribution of winds to particle acceleration. Here we report the detection of young star clusters in the nearby Vela molecular ridge star forming region. The young age of the systems guarantees an unbiased estimate of the stellar CR luminosity free from any supernova or pulsar contamination and allows us to draw conclusions on the acceleration efficiency and the total power supplied by these objects. We demonstrate that much more than 1% of the wind mechanical power is converted into CRs and consequently conclude that a small but non-negligible fraction ~ 1-10% of the CR population is contributed by stellar clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep elemental composition is a challenging measurement to achieve in the giant planets of the solar system. Yet, knowledge of the deep composition offers important insights in the internal structure of these planets, their evolutionary history and their formation scenarios. A key element whose deep abundance is difficult to obtain is oxygen, because of its propensity for being in condensed phases such as rocks and ices. In the atmospheres of the giant planets, oxygen is largely stored in water molecules that condense below the observable levels. At atmospheric levels that can be investigated with remote sensing, water abundance can modify the observed meteorology, and meteorological phenomena can distribute water through the atmosphere in complex ways that are not well understood and that encompass deeper portions of the atmosphere. The deep oxygen abundance provides constraints on the connection between atmosphere and interior and on the processes by which other elements were trapped, making its determination an important element to understand giant planets. In this paper, we review the current constraints on the deep oxygen abundance of the giant planets, as derived from observations and thermochemical models.

 - **Abstract**
 We have searched for stellar activity cycles in late low mass M dwarfs (M0--M6) located in the TESS north and south continuous viewing zones using data from sectors 1--61 (Cycle 1 to part way through Cycle 5). We utilise TESS-SPOC data which initially had a cadence of 30 min but reducing to 10 min in Cycles 3. In addition, we require each star to be observed in at least 6 sectors in each North/South Cycle: 1,950 low mass stars meet these criteria. Strong evidence was seen in 245 stars for a very stable photometric variation which we assume to be a signature of the stars rotation period. We did a similar study for Solar-like stars and found that 194 out of 1432 stars had a very stable modulation. We then searched for evidence of a variation in the rotational amplitude. We found 26 low mass stars showed evidence of variability in their photometric amplitude and only one Solar-like star. Some show a monotonic trend over 3--4 yrs whilst other show shorter term variations. We determine the predicted cycle durations of these stars using the relationship found by Irving (2023} using an estimate of the stars Rossby number. Finally we find a marginally statistically significant correlation between the range in the rotational amplitude modulation and the rotation period.

 - **Abstract**
 A crucial aspect in addressing the challenge of measuring the core mass function, that is pivotal for comprehending the origin of the initial mass function, lies in constraining the temperatures of the cores. We aim to measure the luminosity, mass, column density and dust temperature of star-forming regions imaged by the ALMA-IMF large program. High angular resolution mapping is required to capture the properties of protostellar and pre-stellar cores and to effectively separate them from larger features, such as dusty filaments. We employed the point process mapping (PPMAP) technique, enabling us to perform spectral energy distribution fitting of far-infrared and submillimeter observations across the 15 ALMA-IMF fields, at an unmatched 2.5" angular resolution. By combining the modified blackbody model with near-infrared data, we derived bolometric luminosity maps. We estimated the errors impacting values of each pixel in the temperature, column density, and luminosity maps. Subsequently, we employed the extraction algorithm getsf on the luminosity maps in order to detect luminosity peaks and measure their associated masses. We obtained high-resolution constraints on the luminosity, dust temperature, and mass of protoclusters, that are in agreement with previously reported measurements made at a coarser angular resolution. We find that the luminosity-to-mass ratio correlates with the evolutionary stage of the studied regions, albeit with intra-region variability. We compiled a PPMAP source catalog of 313 luminosity peaks using getsf on the derived bolometric luminosity maps. The PPMAP source catalog provides constraints on the mass and luminosity of protostars and cores, although one source may encompass several objects. Finally, we compare the estimated luminosity-to-mass ratio of PPMAP sources with evolutionary tracks and discuss the limitations imposed by the 2.5" beam.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of TW Hya at 0.65 mm with 0.5 arcsecond angular resolution, together with high angular resolution archival observations at 0.87 mm, 1.3 mm, 2.1 mm and 3.1 mm. We constrain the outer disk emission with both image-plane retrieval, and visibility-plane modeling with non-parametric and parametric fitting tools. Our results confirm emission in the outer disk regions of TW Hya (60 au < R < 110 au) at 0.65 mm, 0.87 mm and 1.3 mm. With image-plane retrieval, we resolve the new continuum gap and ring, namely D79 and B86, at 0.87 mm and 1.3 mm. With visibility-plane modeling, we also detect this substructure at 0.65 mm, and it is consistent in location with the outer ring proposed by Ilee et al. 2022 at the 1-sigma level. Furthermore, it has a high spectral index of 3.7, which may indicate dust grain sizes << 1 mm. It may be a dust trap or a traffic jam, that has a flux density of 60 mJy and a mass (1.59 earth masses) that accounts for up to 2% of the dust disk at 0.65 mm. In conclusion, we confirm the existence of a faint ring in the outer regions of TW Hya at multiple millimeter wavelengths. With visibility-plane modeling, we are able to set constrains that are 3 times better than the resolution of our Band 8 observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Young brown dwarfs exhibit atmospheric characteristics similar to those of super-Jupiters, providing a unique opportunity to study planetary atmospheres. The ESO SupJup Survey, utilizing CRIRES$^+$ on the Very Large Telescope, aims to assess the role of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C as a formation tracer. We present observations of three young brown dwarfs: 2MASS J12003792-7845082, TWA 28, and 2MASS J08561384-1342242, with the goal of constraining their chemical compositions, thermal profiles, surface gravities, spin rotations, and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C. Atmospheric retrievals of CRIRES$^+$ K-band spectra were conducted using the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS coupled with the Bayesian inference algorithm MultiNest, resulting in a detailed characterization of the atmospheres of these objects. We report the volume mixing ratios of main molecular and atomic species, including the novel detection of hydrogen fluoride (HF) in a brown dwarf's atmosphere, and determine $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C values of $81^{+28}_{-19}$ and $79^{+20}_{-14}$ in the atmospheres of TWA 28 and J0856, respectively, with strong significance ($>3\sigma$). Tentative evidence ($\sim 2\sigma$) of $^{13}$C in J1200 was found, with $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = $114^{+69}_{-33}$, along with $^{18}$O detected at moderate significance in J0856 (3.3$\sigma$) and TWA 28 (2.1$\sigma$). The retrieved thermal profiles indicate hot atmospheres (2300-2600 K) with low surface gravities and slow spins, consistent with young objects. The consistent carbon isotope ratios among the three objects, showing no significant deviation from the local ISM, suggest a fragmentation-based formation mechanism similar to star formation. The tentative detection of $^{18}$O in two objects highlights the potential of high-resolution spectroscopy to probe additional isotope ratios, such as $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O, in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and super-Jupiters.

 - **Abstract**
 (2060) Chiron is a large centaur that has been reported active on multiple occasions including during aphelion passage. Studies of Chirons coma during active periods have resulted in the detection of C(triple)N and CO outgassing. Significant work remains to be undertaken to comprehend the activation mechanisms on Chiron and the parent molecules of the gas phases detected. This work reports the study of the ices on Chirons surface and coma and seeks spectral indicators of volatiles associated with the activity. Additionally, we discuss how these detections could be related to the activation mechanism for Chiron and, potentially, other centaurs. In July 2023, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observed Chiron when it was active near its aphelion. We present JWST/NIRSpec spectra from 0.97 to 5.27 microns with a resolving power of 1000, and compare them with laboratory data for identification of the spectral bands. We report the first detections on Chiron of absorption bands of several volatile ices, including CO2, CO, C2H6, C3H8, and C2H2. We also confirm the presence of water ice in its amorphous state. A key discovery arising from these data is the detection of fluorescence emissions of CH4, revealing the presence of a gas coma rich in this hyper-volatile molecule, which we also identify to be in non-local thermal equilibrium (nonLTE). CO2 gas emission is also detected in the fundamental stretching band at 4.27 microns. We argue that the presence of CH4 emission is the first proof of the desorption of CH4 due to a density phase transition of amorphous water ice at low temperature in agreement with the estimated temperature of Chiron during the JWST observations (61 K). Detection of photolytic and proton irradiation products of CH4 and CO2 on the surface, in the coma ice grains, or in the ring material is also detected via a forest of absorption features from 3.5 to 5.3 microns.

          Challenges in modeling the dark matter halo of NGC 1052-DF2: Cored versus cuspy halo models

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of NGC 1052-DF2 and subsequent modeling have shown that NGC 1052-DF2 is deficient in dark matter and is in conflict with the standard stellar-to-halo mass ratio. In this work, we aim to resolve the degeneracy between the dynamical models on the mass estimate of the NGC 1052-DF2.We constructed mass models of NGC 1052-DF2 using an anisotropic distribution function with a radially varying anisotropy parameter and studied the effect of the various model parameters on the dark matter estimates. We used the observed stellar photometry as an input parameter to construct the distribution function and employed a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to estimate the dark matter model parameters.We find that mass models with a cuspy dark matter halo have comparable $\chi^{2}$ to models with zero dark matter. Moreover, the cuspy dark matter halo fails to consistently account for the observed velocity dispersion in the inner and outer regions of the galaxy. Consequently, we rule out the possibility of a cuspy dark matter halo for describing the mass models of NGC 1052 - DF2. Our study shows that the cored dark matter halo model with a total mass of $\log(M_{DM}/M_{\odot})=10.5$ explains the observed kinematics but requires an extraordinarily large scale length (20kpc) and an outer cutoff radius (26kpc). While the cored mass model provides a comparatively better fit, our findings emphasize that the mass models are largely unconstrained by the available kinematic data. Our results suggest that NGC 1052 - DF2 may not only have an ultra-diffuse stellar distribution but that it can, within uncertainties in the available kinematic data, potentially host an ultra-diffuse dark matter distribution compatible with the standard stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) predicted by galaxy formation and evolution models

 - **Abstract**
 Dead time is a common instrumental effect of X-ray detectors which would alter the behavior of timing properties of astronomical signals, such as distorting the shape of power density spectra (PDS), affecting the root-mean-square of potential quasi-periodic oscillation signals, etc. We revisit the effects of the dead time of Medium Energy X-ray telescope (ME) onboard Insight-HXMT, based on the simulation of electronic read-out mechanism that causes the dead time, and the real data. We investigate dead time effects on the pulse profile as well as the Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) signals. The dead time coefficient suggests a linear correlation with the observed count rate in each phase bin of the pulse profile according to the simulation of periodic signal as well as the real data observed on Swift J0243.6+6124. The Fourier-amplitude-difference (FAD) method could well recover the intrinsic shape of the observed PDS in the case that the PDS is from two identical detectors. We apply this technique on ME, by splitting the 9 FPGA modules into 2 groups. The results indicate that the FAD technique suits the case when two groups of detectors are not largely different; and the recovered PDS of Sco X-1 observed by ME slightly enhances the significance of the previously known QPO signal, meanwhile the root-mean-square of QPO is significantly improved. We provide the FAD correction tool implemented in HXMTDAS for users in the future to better analyze QPO signals.

 - **Abstract**
 The extreme outer Galaxy (EOG), which we define as the region of the Milky Way with a galactocentric radius of more than 18 kpc, provides an excellent opportunity to study star formation in an environment significantly different from that in the solar neighborhood because of its lower metallicity and lower gas density. We carried out near- and mid-infrared (NIR and MIR) imaging observations toward two star-forming clusters located in the EOG using JWST NIRCam and MIRI with nine filters: F115W, F150W, F200W, F350W, F405N, F444W, F770W, F1280W, and F2100W. In this paper, we present an overview of the observations, data reduction, and initial results. The NIR sensitivity is approximately 10--80 times better than our previous observation with the Subaru 8.2 m telescope. Accordingly, the mass detection limit reaches to about 0.01--0.05 $M_\odot$, which is about 10 times better than the previous observations. At MIR wavelengths, the high sensitivity and resolution data enable us to resolve individual young stellar objects in such a distant region for the first time. The mass detection limit at MIR F770W filter reaches about 0.1--0.3 $M_\odot$. With these new observations, we have identified components of the clusters that previous surveys did not detect, including class 0 candidates, outflow/jet components, and distinctive nebular structures. These data will enable us to investigate the properties of star formation in the EOG at the same depth of detail as previous observations of star formation in the solar neighborhood.

 - **Abstract**
 To more precisely constrain the Equation of State (EOS) of supradense neutron-rich nuclear matter, future high-precision X-ray and gravitational wave observatories are proposed to measure the radii of neutron stars (NSs) with an accuracy better than about 0.1 km. However, it remains unclear what particular aspects (other than the stiffness generally spoken of in the literature) of the EOS and to what precision they will be better constrained. In this work, within a Bayesian framework using a meta-model EOS for NSs, we infer the posterior probability distribution functions (PDFs) of incompressibility $K_{0}$ and skewness $J_{0}$ of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) as well as the slope $L$, curvature $K_{\rm{sym}}$, and skewness $J_{\rm{sym}}$ characterizing the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$, respectively, from mean values of NS radii consistent with existing observations and an expected accuracy $\Delta R$ ranging from about 1.0 km to 0.1 km. We found that (1) the $\Delta R$ has little effect on inferring the stiffness of SNM at suprasaturation densities, (2) smaller $\Delta R$ reveals more accurately not only the PDFs but also pairwise correlations among parameters characterizing high-density $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$, (3) a double-peak feature of the PDF($K_{\rm{sym}}$) corresponding to the strong $K_{\rm{sym}}-J_{\rm{sym}}$ and $K_{\rm{sym}}-L$ anti-correlations is revealed when $\Delta R$ is less than about 0.2 km, (4) the high-precision radius measurement for canonical NSs is more useful than that for massive ones for constraining the EOS of nucleonic matter around (2-3) times the saturation density of SNM.

 - **Abstract**
 Nuclear theory and experiments, alongside astrophysical observations, constrain the equation of state (EOS) of supranuclear-dense matter. Conversely, knowledge of the EOS allows an improved interpretation of nuclear or astrophysical data. In this article, we use several established constraints on the EOS and the new NICER measurement of PSR J0437-4715 to comment on the nature of the primary companion in GW230529 and the companion of PSR J0514-4002E. We find that, with a probability of $\gtrsim 84\%$ and $\gtrsim 68\%$, respectively, both objects are black holes. These likelihoods increase to above $95\%$ when one uses GW170817's remnant as an upper limit on the TOV mass. We also demonstrate that the current knowledge of the EOS substantially disfavors high masses and radii for PSR J0030+0451, inferred recently when combining NICER with XMM-Newton background data and using particular hot-spot models. Finally, we also use our obtained EOS knowledge to comment on measurements of the nuclear symmetry energy, finding that the large value predicted by the PREX-II measurement displays some mild tension with other constraints on the EOS.

 - **Abstract**
 In this analysis we apply a model-independent framework to test the flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology using simulated SNIa data from the upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and combined with simulated Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) five-years Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data. We adopt an iterative smoothing technique to reconstruct the expansion history from SNIa data, which, when combined with BAO measurements, facilitates a comprehensive test of the Universe's curvature and the nature of dark energy. The analysis is conducted under three different mock true cosmologies: a flat $\Lambda$CDM universe, a universe with a notable curvature ($\Omega_{k,0} = 0.1$), and one with dynamically evolving dark energy. Each cosmology demonstrates different kinds and varying degrees of deviation from the standard model predictions. We forecast that our reconstruction technique can constrain cosmological parameters, such as the curvature ($\Omega_{k0}$) and $H_0 r_\mathrm{d}$, with a precision of approximately 0.52\% for $H_0 r_\mathrm{d}$ and between 0.032 to 0.037 for $\Omega_{k0}$, competitive with current cosmic microwave background constraints, without assuming any form of dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio astronomy studies the Universe by observing the radio emissions of celestial bodies. Different methods can be used to recover the sky brightness distribution (SBD), which describes the distribution of celestial sources from recorded data, with the output dependent on the method used. Image quality assessment (IQA) indexes can be used to compare the differences between restored SBDs produced by different image reconstruction techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of different techniques. However, reconstructed images (for the same SBD) can appear to be very similar, especially when observed by the human visual system (HVS). Hence current structural similarity methods, inspired by the HVS, are not effective. In the past, we have proposed two methods to assess point source images, where low amounts of concentrated information are present in larger regions of noise-like data. But for images that include extended source(s), the increase in complexity of the structure makes the IQA methods for point sources over-sensitive since the important objects cannot be described by isolated point sources. Therefore, in this article we propose augmented Low-Information Similarity Index (augLISI), an improved version of LISI, to assess images including extended source(s). Experiments have been carried out to illustrate how this new IQA method can help with the development and study of astronomical imaging techniques. Note that although we focus on radio astronomical images herein, these IQA methods are also applicable to other astronomical images, and imaging techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an in-depth, high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of the M dwarf K2-18 that hosts a sub-Neptune exoplanet in its habitable zone. We show our technique to accurately normalize the observed spectrum, which is crucial for a proper spectral fitting. We also introduce a new automatic, line-by-line model-fitting code, AutoSpecFit, that performs an iterative ${\chi}^{2}$ minimization process to measure individual elemental abundances of cool dwarfs. We apply this code to the star K2-18, and measure the abundance of 10 elements - C, O, Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, and Fe. We find these abundances moderately supersolar, except for Fe with a slightly subsolar abundance. The accuracy of the inferred abundances is limited by the systematic errors due to uncertain stellar parameters. We also derive the abundance ratios associated with several planet-building elements such as Al/Mg, Ca/Mg, Fe/Mg, and (a solar-like) C/O=0.568 $\pm$ 0.026, which can be used to constrain the chemical composition and the formation location of the exoplanet. On the other hand, the planet K2-18 b has attracted considerable interest, given the JWST measurements of its atmospheric composition. Early JWST studies reveal an unusual chemistry for the atmosphere of this planet, which is unlikely to be driven by formation in a disk of unusual composition. The comparison between the chemical abundances of K2-18 b from future JWST analyses and those of the host star can provide fundamental insights into the formation of this planetary system.

          The Cosmological Preference for Negative Neutrino Mass

 - **Abstract**
 The most precise determination of the sum of neutrino masses from cosmological data, derived from analysis of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), favors a value below the minimum inferred from neutrino flavor oscillation experiments. We explore which data is most responsible of this puzzling aspect of the current constraints on neutrino mass and whether it is related to other anomalies in cosmology. We demonstrate conclusively that the preference for negative neutrino masses is a consequence of larger than expected lensing of the CMB in both the two- and four-point lensing statistics. Furthermore, we show that this preference is robust to changes in likelihoods of the BAO and CMB optical depth analyses given the available data. We then show that this excess clustering is not easily explained by changes to the expansion history and is likely distinct from the preference for for dynamical dark energy in DESI BAO data. Finally, we discuss how future data may impact these results, including an analysis of Planck CMB with mock DESI 5-year data. We conclude that the negative neutrino mass preference is likely to persist even as more cosmological data is collected in the near future.
