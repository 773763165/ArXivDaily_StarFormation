 - **Abstract**
 Recent progress with CMOS detector development has opened new parameter space for high cadence time resolved imaging of transients and fast proper motion solar system objects. Using computer simulations for a ground-based 1.23 m telescope, this research note illustrates the gain of a new generation of fast readout low noise qCMOS sensors over CCDs and makes the case for high precision monitoring of asteroid orbits that can potentially shed light on the hypothetical existence of low mass primordial black holes, as well as for other applications requiring high speed imaging.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background by pulsar timing arrays suggests the presence of a supermassive black hole binary population. Although the observed spectrum generally aligns with predictions from orbital evolution driven by gravitational wave emission in circular orbits, there is a discernible preference for a turnover at the lowest observed frequencies. This turnover could indicate a significant hardening phase, transitioning from early environmental influences to later stages predominantly influenced by gravitational wave emission. In the vicinity of these binaries, the ejection of stars or dark matter particles through gravitational three-body slingshots efficiently extracts orbital energy, leading to a low-frequency turnover in the spectrum. By analyzing the NANOGrav 15-year data, we assess how the gravitational wave spectrum depends on the initial inner galactic profile prior to disruption by binary ejections, accounting for a range of initial binary eccentricities. Our findings suggest a parsec-scale galactic center density around $10^6\,M_\odot/\textrm{pc}^3$ across most of the parameter space, offering insights into the environmental effects on black hole evolution and combined matter density near galaxy centers.

 - **Abstract**
 Direct imaging observations are biased towards wide-separation, massive companions that have degenerate formation histories. Although the majority of exoplanets are expected to form via core accretion, most directly imaged exoplanets have not been convincingly demonstrated to follow this formation pathway. We obtained new interferometric observations of the directly imaged giant planet AF Lep b with the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument. We present three epochs of 50$\mu$as relative astrometry and the K-band spectrum of the planet for the first time at a resolution of R=500. Using only these measurements, spanning less than two months, and the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalogue of Accelerations, we are able to significantly constrain the planet's orbit; this bodes well for interferometric observations of planets discovered by Gaia DR4. Including all available measurements of the planet, we infer an effectively circular orbit ($e<0.02, 0.07, 0.13$ at $1, 2, 3 \sigma$) in spin-orbit alignment with the host, and a measure a dynamical mass of $M_\mathrm{p}=3.75\pm0.5\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$. Models of the spectrum of the planet show that it is metal rich ([M/H]$=0.75\pm0.25$), with a C/O ratio encompassing the solar value. This ensemble of results show that the planet is consistent with core accretion formation.

 - **Abstract**
 SwJ023017.0+283603 (SwJ0230) exhibited soft X-ray (0.3-1.0 keV) eruptions recurring roughly every 22 days. We present results from an extended monitoring campaign of SwJ0230 using Swift, NICER, and deep XMM-Newton observations. Our main findings are: 1) SwJ0230 did not display any eruptions during two 80-day periods (June-September 2023 and July-September 2024) of high-cadence monitoring with NICER and Swift, suggesting that the eruptions have ceased, implying an eruption lifetime of less than 536 days; 2) quiescent/non-eruption emission is detected with XMM-Newton, with a 0.3-2.0 keV luminosity of 4$\times$10$^{40}$ erg/s (bolometric luminosity of $<$0.1% Eddington assuming a black hole mass of 10$^{6-7}$ M$_{\odot}$), that is consistent with a thermal disk spectrum peaking at 0.11$^{+0.06}_{-0.03}$ keV; 3) SwJ0230 exhibited multiple, rapid eruptions (duration$<$5 hours, similar to quasi-periodic eruptions; QPEs), and there is tentative evidence that they recur, on average, on roughly the same timescale of 22 days. \target therefore exhibited (when active) both rapid, QPE-like outbursts and longer-duration outbursts, more akin to those from repeating partial Tidal Disruption Event (rpTDE) candidates. These findings are difficult to explain with existing models that invoke an orbiter interacting with a persistent disk and those involving disk instabilities. We propose a hybrid model wherein an object of smaller mass (e.g., a Jupiter-sized planet) being repeatedly partially stripped and subsequently punching through its own, fallback-induced disk, can explain many of the observed properties, including the long-duration flares (from accretion), the short-duration outbursts (from the planet-disk interaction), and the turn-off of the flares (when the planet is totally stripped of gas).

          Migration of bodies in the Proxima Centauri and Trappist 1 planetary systems

 - **Abstract**
 The motion of planetesimals was studied in the Proxima Centauri and TRAPPIST 1 exoplanetary systems. The size of the feeding zone of planet Proxima Centauri c is discussed. It was noted that after hundreds of Myrs, some planetesimals could still move in elliptical resonant orbits inside the feeding zone of this planet that had been mainly cleared from planetesimals. The probability of a collision of a planetesimal initially located in the feeding zone of planet c with inner planet b was obtained to be about 0.0002 and 0.001 at initial eccentricity of orbits of planetesimals equal to 0.02 or 0.15, respectively. A lot of icy material and volatiles could be delivered from the icy zone near the orbit of planet c to inner planets b and d. The inclinations of orbits of 80% of the planetesimals that moved between 500 or 1200 AU from the star did not exceed 10o. It was obtained that several planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system accumulated planetesimals initially located at the same distance. Outer layers of neighbouring TRAPPIST-1 planets can include similar material.

          A method based on Generative Adversarial Networks for disentangling physical and chemical properties of stars in astronomical spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Data compression techniques focused on information preservation have become essential in the modern era of big data. In this work, an encoder-decoder architecture has been designed, where adversarial training, a modification of the traditional autoencoder, is used in the context of astrophysical spectral analysis. The goal of this proposal is to obtain an intermediate representation of the astronomical stellar spectra, in which the contribution to the flux of a star due to the most influential physical properties (its surface temperature and gravity) disappears and the variance reflects only the effect of the chemical composition over the spectrum. A scheme of deep learning is used with the aim of unraveling in the latent space the desired parameters of the rest of the information contained in the data. This work proposes a version of adversarial training that makes use of a discriminator per parameter to be disentangled, thus avoiding the exponential combination that occurs in the use of a single discriminator, as a result of the discretization of the values to be untangled. To test the effectiveness of the method, synthetic astronomical data are used from the APOGEE and Gaia surveys. In conjunction with the work presented, we also provide a disentangling framework (GANDALF) available to the community, which allows the replication, visualization, and extension of the method to domains of any nature.

 - **Abstract**
 This study analyzes the motion of bodies ejected from the Earth or the Moon. We studied the ejection of bodies from several points on the Earth's surface, as well as from the most far point of the Moon from the Sun. Different velocities and angles of ejection of bodies were considered. The dynamical lifetimes of bodies reached a few hundred million years. Over the entire considered time interval, the values of the probability of a collision of a body ejected from the Earth with the Earth were approximately 0.3, 0.2, and 0.15-0.2 at an ejection velocity vej equaled to 11.5, 12, and 14 km/s, respectively. At vej<11.3 km/s, most of the ejected bodies fell back onto the Earth. The total number of bodies delivered to the Earth and Venus probably did not differ much. The probabilities of collisions of bodies with Mercury and Mars usually did not exceed 0.1 and 0.02, respectively. At vej>11.5 km/s, the probability of a collision of a body ejected from the Earth with the Moon was about 15-35 times less than that with the Earth, and it was about 0.01. The probability of a collision with the Earth for a body ejected from the Moon moving in its present orbit was about 0.3-0.32, 0.2-0.22, and 0.1-0.14 at vej=2.5 km/s, vej=5 km/s, and at 12<vej<16.4 km/s, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider a modified gravity model with a running gravitational constant coupled to a varying dark energy fluid and test its imprint on the growth of structure in the universe. Using Redshift Space Distortion (RSD) measurement results, we show a tension at the $3 \sigma$ level between the best fit $\Lambda$CDM and the corresponding parameters obtained from the Planck data. Unlike many modified gravity-based solutions that overlook scale dependence and model-specific background evolution, we study this problem in the broadest possible context by incorporating both factors into our investigation. We performed a full perturbation analysis to demonstrate a scale dependence in the growth equation. Fixing the scale to $k = 0.1 h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and introducing a phenomenological functional form for the varying Newton coupling $G$ with only one free parameter, we conduct a likelihood analysis of the RSD selected data. The analysis reveals that the model can bring the tension level within $1 \sigma$ while maintaining the deviation of $G$ from Newton's gravitational constant at the fifth order.

 - **Abstract**
 Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) are neutron-star systems that alternate between a rotation-powered radio millisecond pulsar state and an accretion-disk-dominated low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB)-like state on multi-year timescales. During the LMXB-like state, the X-ray emission from tMSPs switches between "low" and "high" X-ray brightness modes on a timescale of seconds to minutes (or longer), while the radio emission shows variability on timescales of roughly minutes. Coordinated VLA and Chandra observations of the nearby tMSP PSR J1023+0038 uncovered a clear anti-correlation between radio and X-ray luminosities such that the radio emission consistently peaks during the X-ray low modes. In addition, there are sometimes also radio/X-ray flares that show no obvious correlation. In this paper, we present simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of a promising tMSP candidate system, 3FGL J1544.6-1125, which shows optical, gamma-ray, and X-ray phenomena similar to PSR J1023+0038, but which is challenging to study because of its greater distance. Using simultaneous VLA and Chandra observations we find that the radio and X-ray emission are consistent with being anti-correlated in a manner similar to PSR J1023+0038. We discuss how our results help in understanding the origin of bright radio emission from tMSPs. The greater sensitivity of upcoming telescopes like the Square Kilometre Array will be crucial for studying the correlated radio/X-ray phenomena of tMSP systems.

 - **Abstract**
 From CMB polarization data alone we reconstruct the CMB lensing power spectrum, comparable in overall constraining power to previous temperature-based reconstructions, and an unlensed E-mode power spectrum. The observations, taken in 2019 and 2020 with the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the SPT-3G camera, cover 1500 deg$^2$ at 95, 150, and 220 GHz with arcminute resolution and roughly 4.9$\mu$K-arcmin coadded noise in polarization. The power spectrum estimates, together with systematic parameter estimates and a joint covariance matrix, follow from a Bayesian analysis using the Marginal Unbiased Score Expansion (MUSE) method. The E-mode spectrum at $\ell>2000$ and lensing spectrum at $L>350$ are the most precise to date. Assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model, and using only these SPT data and priors on $\tau$ and absolute calibration from Planck, we find $H_0=66.81\pm0.81$ km/s/Mpc, comparable in precision to the Planck determination and in 5.4$\sigma$ tension with the most precise $H_0$ inference derived via the distance ladder. We also find $S_8=0.850\pm0.017$, providing further independent evidence of a slight tension with low-redshift structure probes. The $\Lambda$CDM model provides a good simultaneous fit to the combined Planck, ACT, and SPT data, and thus passes a powerful test. Combining these CMB datasets with BAO observations, we find that the effective number of neutrino species, spatial curvature, and primordial helium fraction are consistent with standard model values, and that the 95% confidence upper limit on the neutrino mass sum is 0.075 eV. The SPT data are consistent with the somewhat weak preference for excess lensing power seen in Planck and ACT data relative to predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also detect at greater than 3$\sigma$ the influence of non-linear evolution in the CMB lensing power spectrum and discuss it in the context of the $S_8$ tension.(abridged)

          SCExAO/CHARIS Spectroscopic Characterization of Cloudy L/T Transition Companion Brown Dwarf HIP 93398 B

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs with measured dynamical masses and spectra from direct imaging are benchmarks that anchor substellar atmosphere cooling and evolution models. We present Subaru SCExAO/CHARIS infrared spectroscopy of HIP 93398 B, a brown dwarf companion recently discovered by Li et al. 2023 as part of an informed survey using the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations. This object was previously classified as a T6 dwarf based on its luminosity, with its independently-derived age and dynamical mass in tension with existing models of brown dwarf evolution. Spectral typing via empirical standard spectra, temperatures derived by fitting substellar atmosphere models, and J-H, J-K and H-L' colors all suggest that this object has a substantially higher temperature and luminosity, consistent with classification as a late-L dwarf near the L/T transition (T = 1200$^{+140}_{-119}$ K) with moderate to thick clouds possibly present in its atmosphere. When compared with the latest generation of evolution models that account for clouds with our revised luminosity and temperature for the object, the tension between the model-independent mass/age and model predictions is resolved.

 We estimate the one-loop perturbation kernels for a minimal modified gravity model in which dark energy is coupled to dark mater via a constant coupling. We derive the time-dependent kernels via analytical and numerical solutions and provide accurate fitting functions. These kernels can be directly employed to test for modified gravity in forthcoming large-scale surveys.

          Moving Groups in the Solar Neighborhood with Gaia, APOGEE, GALAH, and LAMOST: Dynamical Effects Gather Gas and the Ensuing Star Formation Plays an Important Role in Shaping the Stellar Velocity Distributions

 - **Abstract**
 With Gaia, APOGEE, GALAH, and LAMOST data, we investigate the positional, kinematic, chemical, and age properties of nine moving groups in the solar neighborhood. We find that each moving group has a distinct distribution in the velocity space in terms of its metallicity, $\alpha$ abundance, and age. Comparison of the moving groups with their underlying background stars suggests that they have experienced the enhanced, prolonged star formation. We infer that any dynamical effects that gathered stars as a moving group in the velocity space also worked for gas. We propose for the first time that the ensuing newborn stars from such gas inherited the kinematic feature from the gas, shaping the current stellar velocity distributions of the groups. Our findings improve the understanding of the origins and evolutionary histories of moving groups in the solar neighborhood.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) JWST continues to deliver incredibly detailed infrared (IR) images of star forming regions in the Milky Way and beyond. IR emission from star-forming regions is very spectrally rich due to emission from gas-phase atoms, ions, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Physically interpreting IR images of these regions relies on assumptions about the underlying spectral energy distribution in the imaging bandpasses. We aim to provide empirical prescriptions linking line, PAH, and continuum intensities from JWST images, to facilitate the interpretation of JWST images in a wide variety of contexts. We use JWST PDRs4All Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) imaging and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) integral field unit (IFU) and MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) spectroscopic observations of the Orion Bar photodissociation region (PDR), to directly compare and cross-calibrate imaging and IFU data at ~100 AU resolution over a region where the radiation field and ISM environment evolves from the hot ionized gas to the cold molecular gas. We measure the relative contributions of line, PAH, and continuum emission to the NIRCam and MIRI filters as functions of local physical conditions. We provide empirical prescriptions based on NIRCam and MIRI images to derive intensities of emission lines and PAH features. Within the range of the environments probed in this study, these prescriptions accurately predict Pa-alpha, Br-alpha, PAH 3.3 um and 11.2 um intensities, while those for FeII 1.644 um, H_2 1--0 S(1) 2.12 um and 1--0 S(9) 4.96 um, and PAH 7.7 um show more complicated environmental dependencies. Linear combinations of JWST NIRCam and MIRI images provide effective tracers of ionized gas, H_2, and PAH emission in PDRs. We expect these recipes to be useful for both the Galactic and extragalactic communities.

 Context. Cosmic dust is ubiquitous in astrophysical environments, where it significantly influences the chemistry and the spectra. Dust grains are likely to grow through the accretion of atoms and molecules from the gas-phase onto them. Despite their importance, only a few studies compute sticking coefficients for relevant temperatures and species, and their direct impact on grain growth. Overall, the formation of dust and its growth are processes not well understood. Aims. To calculate sticking coefficients, binding energies, and grain growth rates over a wide range of temperatures, for various gas species interacting with carbonaceous dust grains. Methods. We perform molecular dynamics simulations with a reactive force field algorithm to compute accurate sticking coefficients and obtain binding energies. The results are included in an astrophysical model of nucleation regions to study dust growth. Results. We present, for the first time, sticking coefficients of H, H2, C, O, and CO on amorphous carbon structures for temperatures ranging from 50 K to 2250 K. In addition, we estimate the binding energies of H, C, and O in carbonaceous dust to calculate the thermal desorption rates. Combining accretion and desorption allows us to determine an effective accretion rate and sublimation temperature for carbonaceous dust. Conclusions. We find that sticking coefficients can differ substantially from what is commonly used in astrophysical models and this gives new insight on carbonaceous dust grain growth via accretion in dust-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from the first application of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS; GPS is one example of a collection of satellites in GNSS) for radio beam calibration using a commercial GNSS receiver with the Deep Dish Development Array (D3A) at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO). Several GNSS satellites pass through the main and side lobes of the beam each day, enabling efficient mapping of the 2D beam structure. Due to the high SNR and abundance of GNSS satellites, we find evidence that GNSS can probe several side lobes of the beam through repeatable measurements of the beam over several days. Over three days of measurements, we find a measured difference reaching a minimum of 0.56 db-Hz in the main lobe of the primary beam. These results show promise for the use of GNSS in beam mapping for the Canadian Hydrogen Observatory and Radio-transient Detector (CHORD) and other future "large-N" radio interferometers. They also motivate future development of the technique within radio astronomy.

It directly impacts the number of $e$-folds and, consequently, the observable parameters of inflation, such as the spectral index of scalar perturbations. By establishing a relationship between the gravitational reheating temperature and the spectral index, we can derive constraints on inflationary models. Specifically, the range of viable reheating temperatures imposes bounds on the spectral index, which can then be compared with observational data, such as those from the Planck satellite, to test the consistency of various models with cosmological observations. Additionally, in the context of dark matter production, we demonstrate that gravitational reheating provides a viable mechanism when there is a relationship between the mass of the dark matter particles and the mass of the particles responsible for reheating. This connection offers a pathway to link dark matter genesis with inflationary and reheating parameters, allowing for a unified perspective on early universe dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 While binary merger events have been an active area of study in both simulations and observational work, the formation channels by which a high-mass star extends from Roche lobe overflow (RLO) in a decaying orbit of a black-hole (BH) companion to a binary black-hole (BBH) system merits further investigation. Variable length-scales must be employed to accurately represent the dynamical fluid transfer and morphological development of the primary star as it conforms to a diminishing Roche lobe under the runaway influence of the proximal BH. We have simulated and evolved binary mass flow under these conditions to better identify the key transitional processes from RLO to BBHs. We demonstrate a new methodology to model RLO systems to unprecedented resolution simultaneously across the envelope, donor wind, tidal stream, and accretion disk regimes without reliance upon previously universal symmetry, mass flux, and angular momentum flux assumptions. We have applied this method to the semidetached high-mass X-ray binary M33 X-7 in order to provide a direct comparison to recent observations of an RLO candidate system at two overflow states of overfilling factors f = 1.01 and f = 1.1. We found extreme overflow (f = 1.1) to be entirely conservative in both mass and angular momentum transport, forming a conical L1 tidal stream of density and deflected angle comparable to existing predictions. This case lies within the unstable mass transfer (MT) regime as recently proposed of M33 X-7. The f = 1.01 case differed in stream geometry, accretion disk size, and efficiency, demonstrating nonconservative stable MT through a ballistic uniform-width stream. The nonconservative and stable nature of the f = 1.01 case MT also suggests that existing assumptions of semidetached binaries undergoing RLO may mischaracterize their role and distribution as progenitors of BBHs and common envelopes.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs form the key, yet poorly understood, link between stellar and planetary astrophysics. These objects offer unique tests of Galactic structure, but observational limitations have inhibited the large-scale analysis of these objects to date. Major upcoming sky surveys will reveal unprecedented numbers of brown dwarfs, among even greater numbers of stellar objects, enabling the statistical study of brown dwarfs. To extract the comparatively rare brown dwarfs from these massive datasets, we must understand how they will look in upcoming surveys. In this work, we construct a synthetic population of brown dwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood to explore their evolutionary properties using Gaia-derived star formation histories alongside observational mass, metallicity, and age relationships. We apply the cloudless Sonora Bobcat, hybrid SM08, and gravity-dependent hybrid Sonora Diamondback evolutionary models to the sample. We present the simulated luminosity function and its evolution with distance from the Galactic Plane. Our simulation shows that brown dwarf population statistics are a function of height above/below the Galactic Plane and sample different age distributions. Interpreting the local sample requires combining evolutionary models, the initial mass function, the star formation history, and kinematic heating. Our models are a guide to how well height-dependent samples can test these scenarios. Sub-populations of brown dwarfs farther from the Plane are older and occupy a different region of brown dwarf parameter space than younger sub-populations closer to the Galactic Plane. Therefore, fully exploring population statistics both near and far from the Plane is critical to prepare for upcoming surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic curvature $\Omega_{K}$ is an important parameter related to the inflationary cosmology and the ultimate fate of the universe. In this work, we adopt the non-CMB observations to constrain $\Omega_{K}$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model and its extensions. The DESI baryon acoustic oscillation, DES type Ia supernova, cosmic chronometer, and strong gravitational lensing time delay data are considered. We find that the data combination favors an open universe in the $\Lambda$CDM model, specifically $\Omega_{K}=0.108\pm0.056$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level, which is in $2.6\sigma$ tension with the Planck CMB result supporting our universe being slightly closed. In the $\Lambda$CDM extensions, the data combination is consistent with a spatially flat universe. However, the central value of $\Omega_{K}$ is positive and has a significant deviation from zero. We adopt the Akaike information criterion to compare different cosmological models. The result shows that non-flat models fit the observational data better that the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, which adds evidence to the argument that flat $\Lambda$CDM is not the ultimate model of cosmology.

 Studying the periodic flux-variation behavior of blazars is vital for probing supermassive black hole binaries and the kinematics of relativistic jets. In this work, we report the detection of the multi-band possible periodic variations of the blazar PKS J2134-0153, including the infrared ($1.6(\pm0.4)\times 10^3$ days) and optical ($1.8(\pm1)\times 10^3$ days). The periods in the infrared and optical bands are statistically consistent with the period in the radio band ($P_{\mathrm{Radio}}$$ = 1760\pm33$ days, obtained from our previous work). Moreover, flux variations in different bands are correlated with evident inter-band time delays, and the time lags of infrared and optical emission with respect to radio emission are $(3.3\pm2.3)\times10^{2}$ days and $(3.0\pm2.3)\times10^{2}$ days, respectively. The cross-correlations indicate a common origin of radio, infrared, and optical emission. The relative positions between emission regions of infrared and optical emission to radio emission are estimated according to the time lags, i.e., $0.37\pm0.26$ pc and $0.33\pm0.26$ pc. The relative distances seem to be quantitatively consistent with the theoretical prediction.

 We present the Early Data Release of the Multi-Cycle JWST-NEXUS Treasury program (2024-2028), which includes NIRCam imaging and WFSS observations from the first (partial) NEXUS-Wide epoch covering the central 100 ${\rm arcmin^2}$ of the NEXUS field, located near the North Ecliptic Pole and within the Euclid Ultra-Deep Field. We release reduced NIRCam mosaics (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F356W, F444W), photometric source catalogs, as well as preliminary WFSS spectra (in F322W2 and F444W) for the subset of bright sources (F356W$<$21 mag or F444W$<$21 mag). These observations fully cover the NEXUS-Deep area, and anchor the long-term baseline of the program. These data will be used for initial target selection for the NIRSpec/MSA spectroscopy starting from June 2025. The NIRCam imaging reaches depths of 27.4--28.2 (AB) mags in F090W--F444W. Upcoming NEXUS-Wide epochs will expand the area to the full $\sim 400\,{\rm arcmin^2}$, and improve the NIRCam exposure depths in the Wide tier by a factor of three. In addition, this central region will be repeatedly covered by the NEXUS-Deep observations (NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec/MSA PRISM spectroscopy) over 18 epochs with a $\sim 2$-month cadence. We demonstrate the data quality of the first NEXUS observations, and showcase some example science cases enabled by these data.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs), where stars are captured or tidally disrupted by supermassive black holes, are potential sources of high-energy neutrinos. We report the discovery of a potential neutrino flare that is spatially and temporally associated with X-ray emission from TDE ATLAS17jrp. The best-fit spectrum of the neutrino flare follows a power-law with an index of $\rm{\gamma=2.7\pm0.4}$ and a flux normalization of $\rm{\Phi_0 =1.7^{+6.3}_{-1.5}\times 10^{-18}\;GeV^{-1} cm^{-2} s^{-1}}$ at 100 TeV based on an analysis of 10-year track data from IceCube, and the flare duration is 61 days. We calculate that the probability of this association occurring by chance is $0.17\%$. Therefore, ATLAS17jrp is the second TDE (not including candidates) associated with high-energy neutrinos, following TDE AT2019dsg associated with an IceCube neutrino alert. This association can be attributed to the interaction of X-ray photons produced by the hot corona with high-energy particles accelerated by disk winds or outflows, resulting in the production of neutrinos.

 - **Abstract**
 Recovering impact parameter variations in multi-planet systems is an effective approach for detecting non-transiting planets and refining planetary mass estimates. Traditionally, two methodologies have been employed: the Individual Fit, which fits each transit independently to analyze impact parameter changes, and the Dynamical Fit, which simulates planetary dynamics to match transit light curves. We introduce a new fitting method, Simultaneous Impact Parameter Variation Analysis (SIPVA), which outperforms the Individual Fit and is computationally more efficient than the Dynamical Fit. SIPVA directly integrates a linear time-dependent model for impact parameters into the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithm by fitting all transits simultaneously. We evaluate SIPVA and the Individual Fit on artificial systems with varying LLRs and find that SIPVA consistently outperforms the Individual Fit in recovery rates and accuracy. When applied to selected Kepler planetary candidates exhibiting significant transit duration variations (TDVs), SIPVA identifies significant impact parameter trends in 10 out of 16 planets. In contrast, the Individual Fit does so in only 4. We also employ probabilistic modeling to calculate the theoretical distribution of planets with significant impact parameter variations across all observed Kepler systems and compare the distribution of recovered candidates by the Individual Fit and Dynamical Fit from previous work with our theoretical distribution. Our findings offer an alternative framework for analyzing planetary transits, relying solely on Bayesian inference without requiring prior assumptions about the planetary system's dynamical architecture.

 In this second paper on the DECam deep drilling field (DDF) program we release 2,020 optical gri-band light curves for transients and variables in the extragalactic COSMOS and ELAIS fields based on time series observations with a 3-day cadence from semester 2021A through 2023A. In order to demonstrate the wide variety of time domain events detected by the program and encourage others to use the data set, we characterize the sample by presenting a brief analysis of the light curve parameters such as time span, amplitude, and peak brightness. We also present preliminary light curve categorizations, and identify potential stellar variables, active galactic nuclei, tidal disruption events, supernovae (such as Type Ia, Type IIP, superluminous, and gravitationally lensed supernovae), and fast transients. Where relevant, the number of identified transients is compared to the predictions of the original proposal. We also discuss the challenges of analyzing DDF data in the context of the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory and its Legacy Survey of Space and Time, which will include DDFs. Images from the DECam DDF program are available without proprietary period and the light curves presented in this work are publicly available for analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Cepheid masses are particularly necessary to help solving the mass discrepancy, while independent distance determinations provide crucial test of the period-luminosity relation and Gaia parallaxes. We used CHARA/MIRC to measure the astrometric positions of the high-contrast companion orbiting the Cepheid SU Cygni. We also present new radial velocity measurements from the HST. The combination of interferometric astrometry with optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy provides the full orbital elements of the system, in addition to component masses and the distance to the Cepheid system. We measured the mass of the Cepheid, $M_A = 4.859\pm0.058M_\odot$, and its two companions, $M_{Ba} = 3.595 \pm 0.033 M_\odot$ and $M_{Bb} = 1.546 \pm 0.009 M_\odot$. This is the most accurate existing measurement of the mass of a Galactic Cepheid (1.2%). Comparing with stellar evolution models, we show that the mass predicted is higher than the measured mass of the Cepheid, similar to conclusions of our previous work. We also measured the distance to the system to be $926.3 \pm 5.0$pc, i.e. an unprecedented parallax precision of $6\mu$as (0.5%), being the most precise and accurate distance for a Cepheid. Such precision is similar to what is expected by Gaia for the last data release (DR5 in $\sim$ 2030) for single stars fainter than G = 13, but is not guaranteed for stars as bright as SU Cyg. We demonstrated that evolutionary models remain inadequate in accurately reproducing the measured mass, often predicting higher masses for the expected metallicity, even when factors such as rotation or convective core overshooting are taken into account. Our precise distance measurement allowed us to compare prediction period-luminosity relations. We found a disagreement of 0.2-0.5 mag with relations calibrated from photometry, while relations calibrated from direct distance measurement are in better agreement.

          Pulsations in binary stars -- a short review

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismology has become an indispensable method for measuring stellar ages and radii, while binary systems remain the most prevalent tool for determining stellar masses. The synergy of the two, namely pulsating stars in binary systems, offer even more than the sum of their parts. The sometimes-overwhelming number of pulsation models to be examined for asteroseismic modelling can be tightly constrained when dynamical masses for both components are available. Binaries offer twice the opportunity to measure an asteroseismic age, which is then applicable to both components of a system, often providing ages for stars that are otherwise very difficult to determine. Some stellar physics, such as the strength of internal mixing or of core overshoot, is so difficult to infer that only in binary systems do sufficient constraints exist to advance our asteroseismic models. The pulsations themselves can also be used to infer dynamical masses through pulsation timing, while eclipsing binaries provide opportunities to test asteroseismic scaling relations. In these proceedings of an invited talk I selectively review the synergies afforded by pulsations in binaries, consisting of a variety of main-sequence primary spectral types, to inferences made from the oscillations of red giants, even when their companions are undetectable. I also describe how the field is changing as we become more data rich through each generation of large photometric survey.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrometric observations with Gaia are expected to play a valuable role in future exoplanet surveys. With current data from Gaia's third data release (DR3), we are sensitive to periods from less than 1 year to more than 4 years but, unlike radial velocity are not as restricted by the orbital inclination of a potential planet. The presence and potential properties of a companion affect the primary's renormalised unit weight error (RUWE) making this a valuable quantity in the search for exoplanets. Using this value and the fitted astrometric tracks from Gaia, we use Bayesian inference to constrain the mass and orbital parameters of companions in known systems. Combining this with radial velocity measurements, we show it is possible to independently measure mass and inclination and suggest HD 66141 b is a possible brown dwarf with maximum mass 23.9$^{+7.2}_{-6.4}$ M$_{\mathrm{J}}$. We show how this method may be applied to directly imaged planets in the future, using $\beta$-Pictoris c as an example but note that the host star is bright and active, making it difficult to draw clear conclusions. We show how the next Gaia data release, which will include epoch astrometry, will allow us to accurately constrain orbital parameters from astrometric data alone, revolutionising future searches for exoplanets. Combining predicted observational limits on planet mass with theoretical distributions, we estimate the probability that a star with a given RUWE will host a detectable planet, which will be highly valuable in planning future surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We reanalyze 15 yr data recorded by the Fermi Large Area Telescope in a region around supernova remnant (SNR) $\gamma$-Cygni from 100 MeV to 1 TeV, and find that the spectra of two extended sources associated with the southeast radio SNR arc and the TeV VERITAS source can be described well by single power-laws with photon indices of $2.149\pm0.005$ and $2.01\pm0.06$, respectively. Combining with high resolution gas observation results, we model the emission in the hadronic scenario, where the $\gamma$-ray emission could be interpreted as escaped CRs illuminating a surrounding Molecular Cloud (MC) plus an ongoing shock-cloud interaction component. In this scenario, the difference between these two GeV spectral indices is due to the different ratios of the MC mass between the escaped component and the trapped component in the two regions. We further analyze, in a potential pulsar halo region, the relationship between energy density $\varepsilon_{\rm{e}}$, spin-down power $\dot{E}$, and the $\gamma$-ray luminosity $L_{\gamma}$ of PSR J2021+4026. Our results indicate that the existence of a pulsar halo is unlikely. On the other hand, considering the uncertainty on the SNR distance, the derived energy density $\varepsilon_{\rm{e}}$ might be overestimated, thus the scenario of a SNR and a pulsar halo overlapping in the direction of the line of sight (LOS) cannot be ruled out.

 Close-binary central stars of planetary nebulae offer a unique tool with which to study the critical and yet poorly understood common-envelope phase of binary stellar evolution. Furthermore, as the nebula itself is thought to comprise the ionised remnant of the ejected common envelope, such planetary nebulae can be used to directly probe the mass, morphology and dynamics of the ejecta. In this review, I summarise our current understanding of the importance of binarity in the formation of planetary nebulae as well as what they may be able to tell us about the common-envelope phase - including the possible relationships with other post-common-envelope phenomena like stellar mergers, novae and type Ia supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 The present Martian climate is characterized by a cold and dry environment with a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxides (CO2). In such conditions, the planetary climate and habitability are determined by the distribution of CO2 between exchangeable reservoirs, that is the atmosphere, ice caps, and regolith. This produces unique responses of the Martian CO2-driven climate system to variations of astronomical forcings. Specifically, it has been shown that the phenomenon called an atmospheric collapse occurs when the axial obliquity is low, affecting the Martian climatic evolution. However, the behavior of the Martian climate system and the accompanying changes in climate and habitability of such planets remain ambiguous. Here we employed a latitudinally-resolved Martian energy balance model and assessed the possible climate on Mars for wider ranges of orbital parameters, solar irradiance, and total exchangeable CO2 mass. We show that the atmospheric collapse occurs when the obliquity is below ~10 degrees when other parameters are kept at the present Mars condition. We also show that the climate solutions on Mars depend on orbital parameters, solar luminosity, and the total exchangeable CO2 mass. We found that the atmospheric collapse would have occurred repeatedly in the history of Mars following the variation of the axial obliquity, while the long-term evolution of atmospheric pCO2 is also affected by the changes in the total exchangeable CO2 mass in Martian history. Even considering the broad ranges of these parameters, the habitable conditions in the Martian CO2-driven dry climate system would be limited to high-latitude summers.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical Be stars, the "e" standing for the presence of spectroscopic line emission, are main sequence stars of spectral type B that are able to form a gaseous disk in Keplerian motion from star-ejected matter. The main driver of this capability is the rapid surface rotation, which might be acquired via binary interaction or through internal stellar evolution, but additional mechanisms, such as nonradial pulsation, usually enable a star to become a Be star well below the actual critical rotation threshold. The angular momentum loss through the disk then keeps the star below the critical rotation value for the rest of its main sequence life span. It is one of the oldest standing research fields of astronomy, since the first discovery of a Be star in 1866. The article, therefore, not only presents the properties of Be stars, but as well the history of the field. The current main research topics, discussed in greater detail, are: 1) the variability of the central object and the nature of Be stars as nonradially pulsating stars, 2) the physics of the viscosity governed circumstellar disk and its variability, which can serve as proxy for the more common, but typically harder to observe viscuous accretion disks, and 3) the role of binarity both in the formation of Be stars as rapid rotators, and as well their impact on the observed properties of these stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Mass loss through a stellar wind is an important physical process that steers the evolution of massive stars and controls the properties of their end-of-life products, such as the supernova type and the mass of compact remnants. For an accurate mass loss determination, the inhomogeneities in the wind, known as clumping, needs to be taking into account. We aim to improve empirical estimates of mass loss and wind clumping for hot main-sequence massive stars, study the dependence of both properties on the metallicity, and compare the theoretical predictions to our findings. We analyzed the optical and UV spectra of 13 O-type stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud galaxy, which has a metallicity of $\sim 0.2\,Z_\odot$. We quantified the stellar atmosphere, outflow, and wind-clumping properties. To probe the role of metallicity, we compared our findings to studies of Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud samples that were analyzed with similar methods. We find significant variations in the wind-clumping properties of the target stars, with clumping starting at flow velocities $0.01 - 0.23$ of the terminal wind velocity and reaching clumping factors $f_{\rm cl} = 2 - 30$. In the luminosity ($\log L / L_{\odot} = 5.0 - 6.0$) and metallicity ($Z/Z_{\odot} = 0.2 - 1$) range we considered, we find that the scaling of the mass loss $\dot{M}$ with metallicity $Z$ varies with luminosity. At $\log L/L_{\odot} = 5.75$, we find $\dot{M} \propto Z^m$ with $m = 1.02 \pm 0.30$, in agreement with pioneering work in the field. For lower luminosities, however, we obtain a significantly steeper scaling of $m > 2$. The monotonically decreasing $m(L)$ behavior adds a complexity to the functional description of the mass-loss rate of hot massive stars. Although the trend is present in the predictions, it is much weaker than we found here.

          ASTERIA -- Thermal Inertia Evaluation of asteroid Didymos

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroid Didymos, recently targeted by the NASA DART mission, is also planned to be visited by the ESA Hera mission. The main goal of the DART mission was to impact Dimorphos, the small satellite of Didymos, which was accomplished in September 2022. This collision altered the Didymos-Dimorphos system, generating a notable quantity of ejecta that turned Dimorphos into an active asteroid, with some ejecta potentially settling on the surfaces of both components. This prompts the investigation into the extent of post-impact surface alterations on these bodies compared to their original states. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pre-impact thermal inertia of Didymos independently. We employed ASTERIA, an alternative to conventional thermophysical modeling, to estimate the surface thermal inertia of Didymos. The approach is based on a model-to-measurement comparison of the Yarkovsky effect-induced drift on the orbital semi-major axis. These results, alongside existing literature, enable an evaluation of the impact-induced alterations in Didymos's thermal inertia. Our nominal estimate with a constant thermal inertia model stands at $\Gamma = 211_{-55}^{+81}$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$, while assuming it varies with the heliocentric distance with an exponent of $-0.75$ thermal inertia of Didymos is found to be $258_{-63}^{+94}$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$. Subsequent verification confirmed that this result is robust against variations in unknown physical parameters. The thermal inertia estimates for Didymos align statistically with values reported in the literature, derived from both pre- and post-impact data. The forthcoming Hera mission will provide an opportunity to corroborate these findings further. Additionally, our results support the hypothesis that the thermal inertia of near-Earth asteroids is generally lower than previously expected.

 - **Abstract**
 The discrepancy between models and data on the muon content in air showers generated by ultra-high energy cosmic rays still needs to be solved. The CONEX simulation framework provides a flexible tool to assess the impact of different interaction properties and address the muon puzzle. In this work, we present the multidimensional extension of CONEX and show its performance compared to CORSIKA by discussing muon-related air-shower features for three experiments: KASCADE, IceTop, and the Pierre Auger Observatory. We also implement an effective version of the core-corona model to demonstrate the impact of the core effect, as observed at the LHC, on the muon content in air showers produced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays. At a primary energy of $E_0 = 10^{19}$ eV, we obtain an increase of $15\%$ to $20\%$ in the muon content.

 - **Abstract**
 High-mass young stellar objects (HMYSOs) can exhibit episodic bursts of accretion, accompanied by intense outflows and luminosity variations. Thermal Instability (TI) due to Hydrogen ionisation is among the most promising mechanisms of episodic accretion in low mass ($M_*\lesssim 1M_{\odot}$) protostars. Its role in HMYSOs has not yet been elucidated. Here, we investigate the properties of TI outbursts in young, massive ($M_*\gtrsim 5M_{\odot}$) stars, and compare them to those observed so far. Our simulations show that modelled TI bursts can replicate the durations and peak accretion rates of long (a few years to decades) outbursts observed in HMYSOs with similar mass characteristics. However, they struggle with short-duration (less than a year) bursts with short (a few weeks or months) rise times, suggesting the need for alternative mechanisms. Moreover, while our models match the durations of longer bursts, they fail to reproduce the multiple outbursts seen in some HMYSOs, regardless of model parameters. We also emphasise the significance of not just evaluating model accretion rates and durations, but also performing photometric analysis to thoroughly evaluate the consistency between model predictions and observational data. Our findings suggest that some other plausible mechanisms, such as gravitational instabilities and disc fragmentation can be responsible for generating the observed outburst phenomena in HMYSOs and underscore the need for further investigation into alternative mechanisms driving short outbursts. However, the physics of TI is crucial in sculpting the inner disc physics in the early bright epoch of massive star formation, and comprehensive parameter space exploration and the use of 2D modeling are essential for obtaining a more detailed understanding of the underlying physical processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar occultations provide a powerful tool to explore objects of the outer solar system. The Gaia mission now provides milli-arcsec accuracy on the predictions of these events and makes possible observations that were previously unthinkable. Occultations return kilometric accuracies on the three-dimensional shape of bodies irrespective of their geocentric distances, with the potential of detecting topographic features along the limb. From the shape, accurate values of albedo can be derived, and if the mass is known, the bulk density is pinned down, thus constraining the internal structure and equilibrium state of the object. Occultations are also extremely sensitive to tenuous atmospheres, down to the nanobar level. They allowed the monitoring of Pluto's and Triton's atmospheres in the last three decades, constraining their seasonal evolution. They may unveil in the near future atmospheres around other remote bodies of the solar system. Since 2013, occultations have led to the surprising discovery of ring systems around the Centaur object Chariklo, the dwarf planet Haumea and the large trans-Neptunian object Quaoar, while revealing dense material around the Centaur Chiron. This suggests that rings are probably much more common features than previously thought. Meanwhile, they have raised new dynamical questions concerning the confining effect of resonances forced by irregular objects on ring particles. Serendipitous occultations by km-sized trans-Neptunian or Oort objects has the potential to provide the size distribution of a population that suffered few collisions until now, thus constraining the history of primordial planetesimals in the 1-100 km range.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron star - black hole (NSBH) mergers that undergo tidal disruption may launch jets that could power a gamma-ray burst. We use a population of simulated NSBH systems to measure jet parameters from the gravitational waves emitted by these systems. The conditions during the tidal disruption and merger phase required to power a gamma-ray burst are uncertain. It is likely that the system must achieve some minimum remnant baryonic mass after the merger before a jet can be launched to power a gamma-ray burst. Assuming a fiducial neutron star equation of state, we show how Bayesian hierarchical inference can be used to infer the minimum remnant mass required to launch a gamma-ray burst jet as well as the maximum gamma-ray burst viewing angle to detect a gamma-ray burst. We find that with 200 NSBH observations, we can measure the minimum disk mass to within 0.01 solar masses at 90% credibility. We simultaneously infer the maximum gamma-ray burst viewing angle to within 13 degrees at 90% credibility. We conclude that upcoming upgrades to the LIGO observatories may provide important new insights into the physics of NSBH jets.

          A model-independent reconstruction of the matter power spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new model-independent reconstruction method for the matter power spectrum based on its time dependence and a combination of observations from different redshifts. The method builds on a perturbative expansion in terms of the linear growth function, with each coefficient in the expansion being a free function of scale, to be reconstructed from the data. When using the linear growth function of a specific cosmological model, e.g. $\Lambda$CDM, the reconstruction can serve as a consistency check for non-linear modeling in that given model, as well as a new method for detecting departures from the assumed model in the data. As an application, we show how using DES Y3 3x2pt and Planck PR4 CMB lensing data, assuming a $\Lambda$CDM linear growth and first order expansion, the reconstructed matter power spectrum $P_{\rm m}(k)$ is compatible with that computed from $\Lambda$CDM and halo model. In particular, we show that the method reconstructs the non-linear part of $P_{\rm m}(k)$ for $k\gtrsim 1\ \rm{Mpc}^{-1}$ without the need of assuming a non-linear model.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of extended $\gamma$-ray emission around middle-aged pulsars is interpreted as inverse-Compton scattering of ambient photons by electron-positron pairs escaping the pulsar wind nebula, which are confined near the system by unclear mechanisms. This emerging population of $\gamma$-ray sources was first discovered at TeV energies and remains underexplored in the GeV range. To address this, we conducted a systematic search for extended sources along the Galactic plane using 14 years of Fermi-LAT data above 10 GeV, aiming to identify a number of pulsar halo candidates and extend our view to lower energies. The search covered the inner Galactic plane ($\lvert l\rvert\leq$ 100$^{\circ}$, $\lvert b\rvert\leq$ 1$^{\circ}$) and the positions of known TeV sources and bright pulsars, yielding broader astrophysical interest. We found 40 such sources, forming the Second Fermi Galactic Extended Sources Catalog (2FGES), most with 68% containment radii smaller than 1.0$^{\circ}$ and relatively hard spectra with photon indices below 2.5. We assessed detection robustness using field-specific alternative interstellar emission models and by inspecting significance maps. Noting 13 sources previously known as extended in the 4FGL-DR3 catalog and five dubious sources from complex regions, we report 22 newly detected extended sources above 10 GeV. Of these, 13 coincide with H.E.S.S., HAWC, or LHAASO sources; six coincide with bright pulsars (including four also coincident with TeV sources); six are associated with 4FGL point sources only; and one has no association in the scanned catalogs. Notably, six to eight sources may be related to pulsars as classical pulsar wind nebulae or pulsar halos.
