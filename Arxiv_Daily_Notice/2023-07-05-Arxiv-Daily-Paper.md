 - **Abstract**
 The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) will induce a dynamical friction (DF) wake on infall to the Milky Way (MW). The MW's stellar halo will respond to the gravity of the LMC and the dark matter (DM) wake, forming a stellar counterpart to the DM wake. This provides a novel opportunity to constrain the properties of the DM particle. We present a suite of high-resolution, windtunnel-style simulations of the LMC's DF wake that compare the structure, kinematics, and stellar tracer response of the DM wake in cold DM (CDM), with and without self-gravity, vs. fuzzy DM (FDM) with $m_a = 10^{-23}$ eV. We conclude that the self-gravity of the DM wake cannot be ignored. Its inclusion raises the wake's density by $\sim 10\%$, and holds the wake together over larger distances ($\sim$ 50 kpc) than if self-gravity is ignored. The DM wake's mass is comparable to the LMC's infall mass, meaning the DM wake is a significant perturber to the dynamics of MW halo tracers. An FDM wake is more granular in structure and is $\sim 20\%$ dynamically colder than a CDM wake, but with comparable density. The granularity of an FDM wake increases the stars' kinematic response at the percent level compared to CDM, providing a possible avenue of distinguishing a CDM vs. FDM wake. This underscores the need for kinematic measurements of stars in the stellar halo at distances of 70-100 kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars (~8-25Msun) stripped of their hydrogen-rich envelopes via binary interaction are thought to be the main progenitors for merging neutron stars and stripped-envelope supernovae. We recently presented the discovery of the first set of such stripped stars in a companion paper. Here, we fit the spectra of ten stars with new atmosphere models in order to constrain their stellar properties precisely. We find that the stellar properties align well with the theoretical expectations from binary evolution models for helium-core burning envelope-stripped stars. The fits confirm that the stars have high effective temperatures (Teff~50-100kK), high surface gravities (log g ~5), and hydrogen-poor/helium-rich surfaces (X(H, surf)~0-0.4) while showing for the first time a range of bolometric luminosities (10^3-10^5 Lsun), small radii (~0.5-1Rsun), and low Eddington factors (Gamma_e~0.006-0.4). Using these properties, we derive intermediate current masses (~1-8Msun), which suggest that their progenitors were massive stars (~5-25Msun) and that a subset will reach core-collapse, leaving behind neutron stars or black holes. Using the model fits, we also estimate the emission rates of ionizing photons for these stars, which agree well with previous model expectations. Further, by computing models for a range of mass-loss rates, we find that the stellar winds are weaker than predicted by any existing scheme (Mdot(wind)<~ 1e-9 Msun/yr). The properties of this first sample of intermediate mass helium stars suggest they both contain progenitors of type Ib and IIb supernovae, and provide important benchmarks for binary evolution and population synthesis models.

 - **Abstract**
 ASASSN-22ak is a transient discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae and by Gaia in 2022 January. Although this object had been in deep quiescence at least for seven years before this outburst, it has been showing relatively regular long (35-40 d) outbursts with intervals of 132-188 d after the 2022 January outburst. This "waking up" phenomenon appears similar to the very unusual (hydrogen-rich) WZ Sge star V3101 Cyg. Time-resolved photometry during the 2023 outburst detected low-amplitude (0.05 mag) superhumps with a period of 0.042876(3) d. ASASSN-22ak appears to be very similar to CRTS J112253.3-111037, which is known to have a very low mass ratio and is considered to be an object evolving close to AM CVn stars as inferred from the low hydrogen and high helium content. ASASSN-22ak is likely yet another object having an evolved core and strongly depleted hydrogen in the secondary. The case of ASASSN-22ak strengthens the idea that a considerable fraction of AM CVn stars are formed from evolved cataclysmic variables. Both ASASSN-22ak and V3101 Cyg before the initial outbursts were probably in dormant states with low quiescent viscosity or low mass-transfer rates. The current "high" states of ASASSN-22ak and V3101 Cyg may have been induced by radiation during the initial outburst or these objects are simply returning to ordinary states, either in terms of quiescent viscosity or mass-transfer rates. We also provide updated superhump period and estimated mass ratio for CRTS J112253.3-111037.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of dust in the diffuse interstellar medium can be best investigated by means of reddening curves where only a single interstellar cloud lies between the observer and the background source. Published reddening curves often suffer from various systematic uncertainties. We merge a sample of 895 reddening curves of stars for which both FORS2 polarisation spectra and UVES high-resolution spectra are available. The resulting 111 sightlines toward OB-type stars have 175 reddening curves. For these stars, we derive their spectral type from the UVES high-resolution spectroscopy. To obtain high-quality reddening curves we exclude stars with composite spectra in the IUE/FUSE data due to multiple stellar systems. Likewise, we omit stars that have uncertain spectral type designations or stars with photometric variability. We neglect stars that show inconsistent parallaxes when comparing DR2 and DR3 from GAIA. Finally, we identify stars that show differences in the space and ground-based derived reddening curves between $0.28\,\mu$m and the $U$-band or in $R_V$. In total, we find 53 stars with one or more reddening curves passing the rejection criteria. This provides the highest quality Milky Way reddening curve sample available today. Averaging the curves from our high-quality sample, we find $R_V = 3.1 \pm 0.4$, confirming previous estimates. A future paper in this series will use the current sample of precise reddening curves and combine them with polarisation data to study the properties of Dark Dust.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasars show a remarkable degree of atomic emission line-broadening, an observational feature which, in conjunction with a radial distance estimate for this emission from the nucleus is often used to infer the mass of the central supermassive black hole. The radius estimate depends on the structure and kinematics of this so-called Broad-Line Region (BLR), which is often modeled as a set of discrete emitting clouds. Here, we test an alternative kinematic disk-wind model of optically thick line emission originating from a geometrically thin accretion disk under Keplerian rotation around a supermassive black hole. We use this model to calculate broad emission line profiles and interferometric phases to compare to GRAVITY data and previously published cloud modelling results. While we show that such a model can provide a statistically satisfactory fit to GRAVITY data for quasar 3C 273, we disfavor it as it requires 3C 273 be observed at high inclination, which observations of the radio jet orientation do not support.
#### Electromagnetic characterization of the LISA verification binary ZTF  J0526$+$5934

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of new and archival data to the 20.506-minute LISA verification binary J052610.42$+$593445.32 (J0526$+$5934). Our joint spectroscopic and photometric analysis finds that the binary contains an unseen $M_1=0.87\pm0.11~{\rm M_\odot}$ CO-core white dwarf primary with an $M_2=0.38\pm0.07~{\rm M_\odot}$ post-core-burning subdwarf, or low-mass white dwarf, companion. Given the short orbital period and relatively large total binary mass, we find that LISA will detect this binary with signal-to-noise ratio $2.7\pm0.6$ after 3 months of observations. We used archival photometry from ZTF DR16 and ATLAS, together with our new high-speed McDonald light curve, to place constraints on the observed orbital decay of J0526$+$5934 and find $\dot{P}_{\rm obs}=-(1.2\pm0.2)\times10^{-11}$, in agreement to within $1\sigma$ of the expected decay rate based on our photometric and spectroscopic analysis. J0526$+$5934 will merge within $1.9\pm0.3~{\rm Myr}$ and likely result in a ${\rm D}^6$ scenario Type Ia supernova or form a He-rich star which will evolve into a massive single white dwarf.
#### Binary Interaction Can Yield a Diversity of Circumstellar Media around  Type II Supernova Progenitors

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of supernovae (SNe) have indicated that a fraction of massive stars possess dense circumstellar medium (CSM) at the moment of their core collapses. They suggest the presence of additional activities of the SN progenitor driving the enhancement of the mass-loss rate, and some physical processes attributing to single star's activities have been considered. In this study, we carry out binary evolutionary simulations of massive stars with the aim of investigating the CSM structure. We show that the mass-transfer rate in a binary can increase at the beginning of the Roche lobe overflow, and this enhancement would be associated with the structure of the CSM before the explosion. We also illustrate that depending on the orbital period of the binary, the density structure of the CSM can have a diverse distribution including shell-like and cliff-like structures. These characteristic structures appear within the lengthscale of $\sim 10^{17}\,{\rm cm}$ and could be traced by long-term observations of SNe, if the slow velocity of the CSM is assumed ($\sim 10\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$). Our results highlight the importance of binary interaction in the aspect of reproducing the diversity of the CSM configuration.
#### The ROAD to discovery: machine learning-driven anomaly detection in  radio astronomy spectrograms

 - **Abstract**
 As radio telescopes increase in sensitivity and flexibility, so do their complexity and data-rates. For this reason automated system health management approaches are becoming increasingly critical to ensure nominal telescope operations. We propose a new machine learning anomaly detection framework for classifying both commonly occurring anomalies in radio telescopes as well as detecting unknown rare anomalies that the system has potentially not yet seen. To evaluate our method, we present a dataset consisting of 7050 autocorrelation-based spectrograms from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) telescope and assign 10 different labels relating to the system-wide anomalies from the perspective of telescope operators. This includes electronic failures, miscalibration, solar storms, network and compute hardware errors among many more. We demonstrate how a novel Self Supervised Learning (SSL) paradigm, that utilises both context prediction and reconstruction losses, is effective in learning normal behaviour of the LOFAR telescope. We present the Radio Observatory Anomaly Detector (ROAD), a framework that combines both SSL-based anomaly detection and a supervised classification, thereby enabling both classification of both commonly occurring anomalies and detection of unseen anomalies. We demonstrate that our system is real-time in the context of the LOFAR data processing pipeline, requiring <1ms to process a single spectrogram. Furthermore, ROAD obtains an anomaly detection F-2 score of 0.92 while maintaining a false positive rate of ~2\%, as well as a mean per-class classification F-2 score 0.89, outperforming other related works.
