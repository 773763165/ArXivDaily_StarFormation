          Complete Hamiltonian Framework of Relativistic Hierarchical Triple Systems: Capabilities and Limitations of Secular Perturbation Theory

 - **Abstract**
 Relativistic secular perturbation theory has ignited significant interest in uncovering intricate cross-term effects, especially the interplay between 1PN and quadrupole terms. While most existing studies rely on the Lagrangian planetary perturbation method for computing cross terms, a comprehensive Hamiltonian framework for the field has been missing. In this work, we introduce a framework based on von Zeipel transformation, utilizing two sequential canonical transformations to systematically compute cross terms to arbitrary orders. Our results reveal secular cross terms up to quadrupole-squared order, showcasing remarkable consistency with both the Lagrangian method [1] and the effective-field-theory approach [2]. We present leading-order periodic cross terms arising from the interactions between 1PN and quadrupole, and present estimates of higher-order cross terms. It is demonstrated that this method not only accurately predicts the long-term evolution of hierarchical systems but also captures fast oscillations observed in N-body simulations. We identify and validate resonances caused by quadrupole-squared effects, highlighting both consistencies and discrepancies when compared to N-body simulations. These discrepancies underscore the importance of mean-motion resonances, a factor overlooked in current secular perturbation frameworks. Finally, we provide a comprehensive review of the subtleties and limitations inherent to secular perturbation theory, paving the way for future research and advancements in this field.

 - **Abstract**
 Spider pulsars are binary systems composed of a millisecond pulsar and a low-mass companion. Their X-ray emission, varying with orbital phase, originates from synchrotron radiation produced by high-energy electrons accelerated at the intrabinary shock. For fast-spinning pulsars in compact binary systems, the intrabinary shock emission occurs in the fast cooling regime. Using global two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate the effect of synchrotron losses on the shock structure and the resulting emission, assuming that the pulsar wind is stronger than the companion wind (so, the shock wraps around the companion), as expected in black widows. We find that the shock opening angle gets narrower for greater losses; the lightcurve shows a more prominent double-peaked signature (with two peaks just before and after the pulsar eclipse) for stronger cooling; below the cooling frequency, the synchrotron spectrum displays a hard power-law range, consistent with X-ray observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The large apertures of the upcoming generation of Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes will enable unprecedented angular resolutions that scale as $\propto$ $\lambda$/D and higher sensitivities that scale as $D^4$ for point sources corrected by adaptive optics. However, all will have pupil segmentation caused by mechanical struts holding up the secondary mirror [European Extremely Large Telescope and Thirty Meter Telescope] or intrinsically, by design, as in the Giant Magellan Telescope. These gaps will be separated by more than a typical atmospheric coherence length (Fried Parameter). The pupil fragmentation at scales larger than the typical atmospheric coherence length, combined with wavefront sensors with weak or ambiguous sensitivity to differential piston, can introduce differential piston areas of the wavefront known as "petal modes". Commonly used wavefront sensors, such as a pyramid WFS, also struggle with phase wrapping caused by >$\lambda$/2 differential piston WFE. We have developed the holographic dispersed fringe sensor, a single pupil-plane optic that employs holography to interfere the dispersed light from each segment onto different spatial locations in the focal plane to sense and correct differential piston between the segments. This allows for a very high and linear dynamic piston sensing range of approximately $\pm$10 $\mu$m. We have begun the initial attempts at phasing a segmented pupil utilizing the HDFS on the High Contrast Adaptive optics phasing Testbed and the Extreme Magellan Adaptive Optics instrument (MagAO-X) at the University of Arizona. Additionally, we have demonstrated use of the HDFS as a differential piston sensor on-sky for the first time. We were able to phase each segment to within $\pm\lambda$/11.3 residual piston WFE ($\lambda$ = 800 nm) of a reference segment and achieved ~50 nm RMS residual piston WFE across the aperture in poor seeing conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Local methods of direct determination of the Hubble constant and $\sigma_8$ seem to conflict with the predictions made from the cosmic microwave background and $\Lambda$CDM. We propose a proof-of-concept model that models portions of the dark sector as several coupled axion-like fields, resulting in both early and late time departures from $\Lambda$CDM. We determine that the model successfully eliminates both the Hubble and $\sigma_8$ tensions, while remaining consistent with both the DESI survey and the BAO sound horizon.

 - **Abstract**
 Structure identification in cosmological simulations plays an important role in analysing simulation outputs. The definition of these structures directly impacts the inferred properties derived from these simulations. This paper proposes a more straightforward definition and model of structure by focusing on density peaks rather than halos and clumps. It introduces a new watershed algorithm that uses phase-space analysis to identify structures, especially in complex environments where traditional methods may struggle due to spatially overlapping structures. Additionally, a merger tree code is introduced to track density peaks across timesteps, making use of the boosted potential for identifying the most bound particles for each peak.

 - **Abstract**
 Our interpretation of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheric spectra will always be limited by the accuracy of the data we use as input in our forward and retrieval models. Ultraviolet molecular absorption cross sections are one category of these essential model inputs; however, they are often poorly characterized at the longest wavelengths relevant to photo-dissociation. Photolysis reactions dominate the chemical kinetics of temperate terrestrial planet atmospheres. One molecule of particular importance is CO$_2$, which is likely present in all terrestrial planet atmospheres. The photolysis of CO$_2$ can introduce CO and O, as well as shield tropospheric water vapor from undergoing photolysis. This is important because H$_2$O photolysis produces OH, which serves as a major reactive sink to many atmospheric trace gases. Here, we construct CO$_2$ cross-section prescriptions at 195K and 300K extrapolated beyond 200 nm from measured cross sections. We compare results from the implementation of these new cross sections to the most commonly used CO$_2$ prescriptions for temperate, terrestrial planets with Archean-like atmospheres. We generally find that the observational consequences of CO$_2$ dissociation beyond 200 nm is minimal so long as our least conservative (highest opacity) prescription can be ruled out. Moreover, implementing our recommended extended CO$_2$ cross sections does not substantially alter previous results showing the consequential photochemical impact of extended H$_2$O cross sections.

 - **Abstract**
 The beta Pictoris system, with its two directly imaged planets beta Pic b and beta Pic c and its well characterised debris disk, is a prime target for detailed characterisation of young planetary systems. Here, we present high-resolution and high-contrast LM band spectroscopy with CRIRES+ of the system, primarily for the purpose of atmospheric characterisation of beta Pic b. We developed methods for determining slit geometry and wavelength calibration based on telluric absorption and emission lines, as well as methods for PSF modelling and subtraction, and artificial planet injection, in order to extract and characterise planet spectra at a high S/N and spectral fidelity. Through cross-correlation with model spectra, we detected H2O absorption for planet b in each of the 13 individual observations spanning four different spectral settings. This provides a clear confirmation of previously detected water absorption, and allowed us to derive an exquisite precision on the rotational velocity of beta Pic b, v_rot = 20.36 +/- 0.31 km/s, which is consistent within error bars with previous determinations. We also observed a tentative H2O cross-correlation peak at the expected position and velocity of planet c; the feature is however not at a statistically significant level. Despite a higher sensitivity to SiO than earlier studies, we do not confirm a tentative SiO feature previously reported for planet b. When combining data from different epochs and different observing modes for the strong H2O feature of planet b, we find that the S/N grows considerably faster when sets of different spectral settings are combined, compared to when multiple data sets of the same spectral setting are combined. This implies that maximising spectral coverage is often more important than maximising integration depth when investigating exoplanetary atmospheres using cross-correlation techniques.

          Kinetic and photochemical disequilibrium in the potentially carbon-rich atmosphere of the warm-Jupiter WASP-69b

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution transmission spectroscopy of the warm gas-giant WASP-69b has revealed the presence of H2O, CO, CH4, NH3, and C2H2 in its atmosphere. This study investigates the impact of vertical diffusion and photochemistry on its atmospheric composition, with a focus on the detected species plus HCN and CO2, to constrain the atmospheric C/O ratio. We utilize non-equilibrium gas-phase simulations to conduct a parameter study for vertical diffusion strength, local gas temperature, and C/O ratio. Our results indicate that a carbon-rich atmosphere enhances CH4 and C2H2 concentrations, while NH3 undergoes chemical conversion into HCN in carbon-rich, high-temperature environments. Consequently, HCN is abundantly produced in such atmospheres, though its strong spectral features remain undetected in WASP-69b. Photochemical production of HCN and C2H2 is highly sensitive to vertical diffusion strength, with weaker diffusion resulting in higher concentrations. Cross-correlation of synthetic spectra with observed data shows that models with C/O=2 best match observations, but models with C/O=0.55 and 0.9 lead to statistically equivalent fits, leaving the C/O ratio unconstrained. We highlight the importance of accurately modeling NH3 quenching at pressures greater than 100 bars. Models for WASP-69b capped at 100 bars bias cross-correlation fits towards carbon-rich values. We suggest that if the atmosphere of WASP-69b is indeed carbon-rich with a solar metallicity, future observations should reveal the presence of HCN.

 - **Abstract**
 The past decade has seen a rise in the use of Machine Learning methods in the study of young stellar evolution. This trend has led to a growing need for a comprehensive database of young stellar objects (YSO) that goes beyond survey-specific biases and that can be employed for training, validation, and refining the physical interpretation of machine learning outcomes. We reviewed the literature focused on the Orion Star Formation complex (OSFC) to compile a thorough catalogue of previously identified YSO candidates in the region including the curation of observables relevant to probe their youth. Starting from the NASA/ADS database, we assembled YSO candidates from more than 200 peer-reviewed publications. We collated data products relevant to the study of YSOs into a dedicated catalogue, which was complemented with data from large photometric and spectroscopic surveys and in the Strasbourg astronomical Data Center. We also added significant value to the catalogue by homogeneously deriving YSO infrared classification labels and through a comprehensive curation of labels concerning sources' multiplicity. Finally, we used a panchromatic approach to derive the probabilities that the sources in our catalogue were contaminant extragalactic sources or giant stars. We present the NEMESIS catalogue of YSOs for the OSFC, which includes data collated for 27879 sources covering the whole mass spectrum and the various stages of pre-Main Sequence evolution from protostars to diskless young stars. The catalogue includes a collection of panchromatic photometric data processed into spectral energy distributions, stellar parameters, infrared classes, equivalent widths of emission lines related to YSOs accretion and star-disk interaction, and absorption lines such as lithium and lines related to source's gravity, X-ray emission observables, photometric variability observables, and multiplicity labels.

 - **Abstract**
 The measurement of cosmological distances using baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) is crucial for studying the universe's expansion. The Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) galaxy redshift survey, with its vast volume and sky coverage, provides an opportunity to address key challenges in cosmology. However, redshift uncertainties in galaxy surveys can degrade both angular and radial distance estimates. In this study, we forecast the precision of BAO distance measurements using mock CSST galaxy samples, applying a two-point correlation function (2PCF) wedge approach to mitigate redshift errors. We simulate redshift uncertainties of $\sigma_0 = 0.003$ and $\sigma_0 = 0.006$, representative of expected CSST errors, and examine their effects on the BAO peak and distance scaling factors, $\alpha_\perp$ and $\alpha_\parallel$, across redshift bins within $0.0 < z \leqslant 1.0$. The wedge 2PCF method proves more effective in detecting the BAO peak compared to the monopole 2PCF, particularly for $\sigma_0 = 0.006$. Constraints on the BAO peaks show that $\alpha_\perp$ is well constrained around 1.0, regardless of $\sigma_0$, with precision between 1% and 3% across redshift bins. In contrast, $\alpha_\parallel$ measurements are more sensitive to increases in $\sigma_0$. For $\sigma_0 = 0.003$, the results remain close to the fiducial value, with uncertainties ranging between 4% and 9%; for $\sigma_0 = 0.006$, significant deviations from the fiducial value are observed. We also study the ability to measure parameters $(\Omega_m, H_0r_\mathrm{d})$ using distance measurements, proving robust constraints as a cosmological probe under CSST-like redshift uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the follow-up spectroscopic confirmation of two lensed quasars, six dual quasars, and eleven projected quasars that were previously identified as lensed-quasar candidates in \cite{He2023}. The spectroscopic data were obtained from two different sources: the P200/DBSP in California and publicly available datasets, including SDSS and DESI-EDR. The two lensed quasars (both pairs) have the following properties: $\theta_E$ = 1.208'', $z_s$ = 3.105; $\theta_E$ = 0.749, $z_s$ = 2.395. The six dual quasars have redshifts ranging from 0.58 to 3.28 and projected separations ranging from 15.44 to 22.54 kpc, with a mean separation of 17.95 kpc. The eleven projected quasars have projected separations ranging from 10.96 to 39.07 kpc, with a mean separation of 22.64 kpc. Additionally, there are three likely lensed quasars that cannot be definitively confirmed, contributed by two reasons. Firstly, their image separations (0.83'', 0.98'', and 0.93'') are small compared to the seeing conditions during our observations (around 1.2''). Secondly, no high SNR lensing galaxy can be detected in the Legacy Survey Imaging. Better spectroscopy and (or) imaging are needed to confirm their lensing nature.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) might originate from supermassive primordial black holes (PBHs). However, the hypothesis that these PBHs formed through the enhancement of the primordial curvature perturbations has consistently faced significant challenges due to the stringent constraints imposed by $\mu$-distortion in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this work, we investigate the impact of non-Gaussianity on $\mu$-distortion constraint in the context of broad power spectra. Our results show that, under the assumption of non-Gaussian curvature perturbations, a broad power spectrum may lead to weaker $\mu$-distortion constraints compared to the Gaussian cases. Our findings highlight the potential of the broad power spectrum to alleviate the $\mu$-distortion constraints on supermassive PBHs under large non-Gaussianity.

 As part of the LAMOST medium-resolution spectroscopic survey, the LAMOST-MRS-O is a non-time domain survey that aims to perform medium-resolution spectral observations for member stars in the open cluster area. This survey plans to obtain the spectroscopic parameters such as radial velocity and metal abundances of member stars and provide data support for further study on the chemical and dynamical characteristics and evolution of open clusters in combination with Gaia data. We have completed the observations on ten open cluster fields and obtained 235184 medium-resolution spectra of 133792 stars. Based on the data analyzed of LAMOST DR11V1.1, for some clusters of particular concern, it is found that the sampling ratio of members stars with Gmag < 15 mag can reach 70%, which indicates that the LAMOST-MRS-O has reached our initial design goal.

          Gamma-ray flares from the jet of the blazar CTA 102 in 2016-2018

 - **Abstract**
 CTA 102 is a $\gamma$-ray bright blazar that exhibited multiple flares in observations by the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope during the period of 2016-2018. We present results from the analysis of multi-wavelength light curves aiming at revealing the nature of $\gamma$-ray flares from the relativistic jet in the blazar. We analyse radio, optical, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray data obtained in a period from 2012 September 29 to 2018 October 8. We identify six flares in the $\gamma$-ray light curve, showing a harder-when-brighter-trend in the $\gamma$-ray spectra. We perform a cross-correlation analysis of the multi-wavelength light curves. We find nearly zero time lags between the $\gamma$-ray and optical and X-ray light curves, implying a common spatial origin for the emission in these bands. We find significant correlations between the $\gamma$-ray and radio light curves as well as negative/positive time lags with the $\gamma$-ray emission lagging/leading the radio during different flaring periods. The time lags between $\gamma$-ray and radio emission propose the presence of multiple $\gamma$-ray emission sites in the source. As seen in 43 GHz images from the Very Long Baseline Array, two moving disturbances (or shocks) were newly ejected from the radio core. The $\gamma$-ray flares from 2016 to 2017 are temporally coincident with the interaction between a traveling shock and a quasi-stationary one at $\sim$0.1 mas from the core. The other shock is found to emerge from the core nearly simultaneous with the $\gamma$-ray flare in 2018. Our results suggest that the $\gamma$-ray flares originated from shock-shock interactions.

          Impact of particle production during inflation on the detection of CMB B-mode polarization

 - **Abstract**
 This work focuses on particle production described by a nonminimally coupled model during inflation. In this model, three parameters determine the characteristic frequency and strength of the induced gravitational waves (GWs). Considering the impact of particle production on inflation, we identify the parameter values that generate the strongest GWs without violating the slow-roll mechanism at the CMB scale. However, even with such extreme parameters, the power spectrum of induced GWs is only about three thousandths of that of primordial GWs. This contribution remains insignificant when identifying the primary source of a detected CMB B-mode polarization. However, to precisely confirm the energy scale of inflation and extract information about quantum gravity, distinguishing between the CMB B-mode polarization from different sources is crucial. We compare the total power spectrum with that of primordial GWs, revealing a characteristic peak in the total spectrum. This peak can be used to test the model and differentiate it from other inflationary sources.

          The polarisation behaviour of OJ 287 viewed through radio, millimetre and optical observations between 2015 and 2017

 - **Abstract**
 OJ 287 is a bright blazar with century-long observations, and one of the strongest candidates to host a supermassive black hole binary. Its polarisation behaviour between 2015 and 2017 (MJD 57300-58000) contains several interesting events that we re-contextualise in this study. We collected optical photometric and polarimetric data from several telescopes and obtained high-cadence light curves from this period. In the radio band, we collected mm-wavelength polarisation data from the AMAPOLA program. We combined these with existing multifrequency polarimetric radio results and the results of very-long-baseline-interferometry imaging with the Global mm-VLBI Array at 86 GHz. In December 2015, an optical flare was seen according to the general relativistic binary black hole model. We suggest that the overall activity near the accretion disk and the jet base during this time may be connected to the onset of a new moving component K seen in the jet in March 2017. With the additional optical data, we find a fast polarisation angle rotation of 210 degrees coinciding with the December 2015 flare, hinting at a possible link between these events. Based on the 86-GHz images, we calculated a new speed of 0.12 mas/yr for K, which places it inside the core at the time of the 2015 flare. This speed also supports the scenario where the passage of K through the quasi-stationary feature S1 could have been the trigger for the very-high-energy gamma-ray flare of OJ 287 seen in February 2017. With the mm-polarisation data, we established that these bands follow the cm-band data but show a difference during the time of K passing through S1. This indicates that the mm-bands trace the substructures of the jet still unresolved in the cm-bands.

 - **Abstract**
 Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) detect gamma rays by measuring the Cherenkov light emitted by secondary particles in the air shower when the gamma rays hit the atmosphere. At low energies, the limited amount of Cherenkov light produced typically implies that the event is registered by one IACT only. Such events are called monoscopic events, and their analysis is particularly difficult. Challenges include the reconstruction of the event's arrival direction, energy, and the rejection of background events. Here, we present a set of improvements, including a machine-learning algorithm to determine the correct orientation of the image, an intensity-dependent selection cut that ensures optimal performance, and a collection of new image parameters. To quantify these improvements, we use the central telescope of the H.E.S.S. IACT array. Knowing the correct image orientation, which corresponds to the arrival direction of the photon in the camera frame, is especially important for the angular reconstruction, which could be improved in resolution by 57% at 100 GeV. The event selection cut, which now depends on the total measured intensity of the events, leads to a reduction of the low-energy threshold for source analyses by ~50%. The new image parameters characterize the intensity and time distribution within the recorded images and complement the traditionally used Hillas parameters in the machine learning algorithms. We evaluate their importance to the algorithms in a systematic approach and carefully evaluate associated systematic uncertainties. We find that including subsets of the new variables in machine-learning algorithms improves the reconstruction and background rejection, resulting in a sensitivity improved by 41% at the low-energy threshold.

 - **Abstract**
 Cerberus will be a new scientific instrument for the alt-az, 1m-class OARPAF telescope in Northern Italy. Currently, the telescope operates with a CCD camera used for imaging and photometry. One of the objectives of the project is to improve this observing mode with a tip-tilt lens for image stabilization up to 10Hz. Moreover, a long-slit spectroscopy at R 5900 and an optical fiber échelle spectroscopy at R 9300 observing modes will be included. These addtional two "heads" of Cerberus will be exclusively selected by moving flat 45 degree mirrors by means of a linear stage placed in a new custom interface flange. The flange will replace the existing one, recovering the included field flattener lens, to ensure optical correction of the imaging channel. We present the already procured COTS hardware, the opto-mechanical design of the interface flange, the results of the Zemax ray tracing and the design of the web-based instrument control software.

 We conduct a comprehensive study into the impact of pixelization on cosmic shear, uncovering several sources of bias in standard pseudo-$C_\ell$ estimators based on discrete catalogues. We derive models that can bring residual biases to the percent level on small scales. We elucidate the impact of aliasing and the varying shape of HEALPix pixels on power spectra and show how the HEALPix pixel window function approximation is made in the discrete spin-2 setting. We propose several improvements to the standard estimator and its modelling, based on the principle that source positions and weights are to be considered fixed. We show how empty pixels can be accounted for either by modifying the mixing matrices or applying correction factors that we derive. We introduce an approximate interlacing scheme for the HEALPix grid and show that it can mitigate the effects of aliasing. We introduce bespoke pixel window functions adapted to the survey footprint and show that, for band-limited spectra, biases from using an isotropic window function can be effectively reduced to zero. This work partly intends to serve as a useful reference for pixel-related effects in angular power spectra, which are of relevance for ongoing and forthcoming lensing and clustering surveys.

 The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has revealed the horizon-scale radiation of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), our galaxy's central supermassive black hole, offering a new platform to test gravitational theories. The next step involves studying accretion flows and spacetime structures near black holes using EHT time variability data and GRMHD simulations. We study accretion dynamics in spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes deviating from general relativity, using 2D GRMHD simulations with Rezzolla-Zhidenko spacetime. This study systematically investigates how light curve variability amplitudes from non-Kerr GRMHD simulations depend on Schwarzschild spacetime deviations, based on the constraints from weak gravitational fields and Sgr A*'s shadow size. We find that the dynamics of accretion flows systematically depend on the deviation. In spacetimes with a deeper gravitational potential, fluid and Alfvén velocities consistently decrease relative to the Schwarzschild metric, indicating weaker dynamical behavior. We also examine the influence of spacetime deviations on radiation properties by computing luminosity fluctuations at 230 GHz using general relativistic radiative transfer simulations, in line with EHT observations. The amplitude of these fluctuations exhibits a systematic dependence on the deviation parameters, decreasing for deeper gravitational potentials compared to the Schwarzschild metric. These features are validated using one of the theoretically predicted metrics, the Hayward metric, a model that describes nonsingular black holes. This characteristic is expected to have similar effects in future comprehensive simulations that include more realistic accretion disk models and electron cooling in the future, potentially aiding in distinguishing black hole solutions that explain the variability of Sgr A*.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extraordinary astrophysical phenomena characterized by short radio pulses that last only a few milliseconds, yet their power can surpass that of 500 million suns. To date, most detected FRBs originate from beyond our galaxy. However, if an FRB were to originate within the Milky Way, it could be detected using small antennas. In this paper, we propose a compact and ad-hoc antenna array designed for the efficient detection and localization of FRBs within the Milky Way. The antenna operates within the 1200-1800 MHz range and consists of three sub-arrays placed in an L-shape for source localization, occupying a total volume of 80x25x6 cm^3. Each sub-array consists of 4 miniaturized, dual-polarized, half-space radiation antenna elements, forming a one-dimensional array that allows shaping the radiation pattern to match the form of the Milky Way without exhibiting grating lobes. A prototype was constructed and characterized to validate the design. The measured results exhibit good agreement with the simulations. In addition to having a custom elongated radiation pattern, the array has attractive merits, such as low reflections at the input ports, high radiation efficiency, and a distribution that inhibits the existence of phase ambiguities, thus facilitating source localization.

 - **Abstract**
 SDSS J1115+0544 is a unique low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) galaxy with energetic ultraviolet (UV), optical and mid-infrared outbursts occurring in its nucleus. We present the results from an analysis of multi-wavelength photometric and radio follow-up observations covering a period of ~9 years since its discovery. We find that following a luminosity plateau of ~500 days, the UV/optical emission has decayed back to the pre-outburst level, suggesting that the nuclear outburst might be caused by a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE). In this case, SDSS J1115+0544 could be an unusually slow-evolved optical TDE with longest rise and decline time-scales ever found. Three years later than the optical peak, a delayed radio brightening was found with a 5.5 GHz luminosity as high as ~1.9x10^39 erg/s. Using a standard equipartition analysis, we find the outflow powering the radio emission was launched at t~1260 days with a velocity of beta<~0.1 and kinetic energy of E_K~>10^50 erg. The delayed radio brightening coupled with the disappearing plateau in the UV/optical light curves is consistent with the scenario involving delayed ejection of an outflow from a state transition in the disk. SDSS J1115+0544 is the first TDE displaying both a short-lived UV/optical plateau emission and a late-time radio brightening. Future radio observations of these TDEs in the post-plateau decay phase will help to establish the connection between outflow launching and changes in accretion rate.

 - **Abstract**
 The mismatch between the mass function of the Milky Way's embedded clusters (ECs) and that of open clusters (OCs) raises the question of whether each OC originates from a single EC. In this work, we explore a scenario in which OCs form as a result of post-gas expulsion coalescence of ECs within the same parental molecular cloud. We model this process using N-body simulations of ECs undergoing expansion due to gas expulsion. Our initial conditions are based on the observed spatial, kinematic, and mass distributions of ECs in three representative massive star-forming regions (MSFRs). Initially, ECs are isolated. After further expansion, interactions between ECs begin, mutually influencing their evolution. We examine this process as a function of gas expulsion timescales, spatial separations between ECs, and their relative velocities. Our results demonstrate that, within a reasonable range of these parameters, the coalescence of ECs is robust and largely insensitive to initial conditions. The mass of ECs plays a critical role in the coalescence process. More massive ECs form stable gravitational cores, which greatly facilitate coalescence and help the resulting cluster resist expansion and Galactic tidal forces. Additionally, the number of ECs also enhances coalescence. The current mass distribution of clumps in the Milky Way suggests that directly forming massive ECs is challenging. However, the coalescence of multiple low-mass ECs can account for the observed parameter space of OCs in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of correlations between high Li abundances and strong chromospheric He I 10830 Å absorption line strengths in Kepler field giant stars. Our sample includes 84 giants with detectable solar-like oscillations in their lightcurves, and their Li abundances come from the literature or were measured here using LAMOST medium-resolution spectra. Evolutionary phases are determined through asteroseismic analysis, with mixed-mode period spacing (\Delta P) used to infer the time evolution of RC giants. Near-infrared observations of the He I \lambda 10830 line were obtained with the high-resolution Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) spectrograph on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET). We find high Li abundances and strong He I lines exclusively among red clump (RC) giants, with their absence in red giant branch stars suggesting a shared origin linked to the He-flash. Additionally, a steady decline in He I strength with decreasing Li abundance among RC giants indicates a correlation between these properties. Older, Li-normal RC giants are He-weak, while most younger super-Li-rich giants are He-strong, suggesting temporal evolution of both phenomena. We hypothesize that the core He-flash and subsequent sub-flashes may enhance Li abundances in RC giant photospheres and trigger heightened chromospheric activity, leading to stronger He I \lambda 10830 Å lines in younger RCs. Over time, post-He-flash, chromospheric activity diminishes, resulting in weaker He I lines in older, Li-normal RCs.

 - **Abstract**
 Following the discovery of dimethyl sulfide (CH$_3$SCH$_3$, DMS) signatures in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, we report the first detection of this organosulfur species in the interstellar medium, during the exploration of an ultradeep molecular line survey performed toward the Galactic Center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027 with the Yebes 40$\,$m and IRAM 30$\,$m telescopes. We derive a molecular column density of $N$ = (2.6 $\pm$ 0.3)$\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, yielding a fractional abundance relative to H$_2$ of $\sim$1.9$\times$10$^{-10}$. This implies that DMS is a factor of $\sim$1.6 times less abundant than its structural isomer CH$_3$CH$_2$SH and $\sim$30 times less abundant than its O-analogue dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$) toward this cloud, in excellent agreement with previous results on various O/S pairs. Furthermore, we find a remarkable resemblance between the relative abundance of DMS/CH$_3$OH in G+0.693-0.027 ($\sim$1.7$\times$10$^{-3}$) and in the comet ($\sim$1.3$\times$10$^{-3}$), further strengthening the connection between the chemical inventory of the interstellar medium and that of the minor bodies of the Solar System. Although the chemistry of DMS beyond Earth is yet to be fully disclosed, this discovery provides conclusive observational evidence on its efficient abiotic production in the interstellar medium, casting doubts about using DMS as a reliable biomarker in exoplanet science.

          The case for a low dark matter density in dynamical dark energy model from local probes

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we investigate, through a Bayesian study, the ability of a local low matter density $\Omega_{\rm M}$, in discrepancy with the value usually inferred from the CMB angular power spectrum, to accommodate observations from local probes without being in tension with the local values of the Hubble constant $H_0$ or the matter fluctuation $\sigma_8$ parameters. For that, we combine multiple local probes, with the criteria that they either can constrain the matter density parameter independently from the CMB constraints, or can help in doing so after making their relevant observations more model independent by relaxing their relevant calibration parameters. We assume however, either a dynamical dark energy model, or the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, when computing the corresponding theoretical observables. We also add, in almost all of our Monte Carlo runs, the latest Baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from the DESI year one release to our core group. We found that, within $\Lambda$CDM model, for different combinations of our probes, we can accommodate a low matter density along with the $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ values usually obtained from local probes, providing we promote the sound drag $r_s$ component in BAO calculations to a free parameter, and that even if we combine with the Pantheon+ Supernova sample. Assuming $w_0w_a$CDM, we also found that relaxing $r_s$ allow us to accommodate $\Omega_{\rm M}$, $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ within their local values, with still however a preference for $w_0w_a$ values far from $\Lambda$CDM. However, when including Pantheon+ Supernova sample, we found that the latter preference for high matter density pushes $\sigma_8$ to much smaller values, mitigating by then a low matter density solution to the two common tensions. We conclude that a low matter density value, helps in preserving the concordance within $\Lambda$CDM model. (abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we estimate the explosion and progenitor properties of six Type II supernovae (SNe) at 0.675 <= z <= 3.61 discovered by the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) transient survey by modeling their light curves. This high-redshift Type II SN sample allows us to compare low-redshift Type II SNe to their high-redshift counterparts. Two Type II SNe are found to have high explosion energies of 3e51 erg, while the other four Type II SNe are estimated to have typical explosion energies found in the local Universe [(0.5-2)e51 erg]. The fraction of Type II SNe with high explosion energies might be higher at high redshifts because of, e.g., lower metallicity, but it is still difficult to draw a firm conclusion because of the small sample size and potential observational biases. We found it difficult to constrain the progenitor masses for Type II SNe in our sample because of the sparse light-curve data. We found two Type II SN light curves can be better reproduced by introducing confined, dense circumstellar matter. Thus, the confined, dense circumstellar matter frequently observed in nearby Type II SNe is likely to exist in Type II SNe at high redshifts as well. Two Type II SNe are estimated to have high host galaxy extinctions, showing the ability of JWST to discover dust-obscured SNe at high redshifts. More high-redshift Type II SNe are required to investigate the differences in the properties of Type II SNe near and far, but here we show the first glimpse into the high-redshift population of Type II SNe.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, approximately 150 low-mass white dwarfs (WDs), typically with masses below 0.4 solar masses, have been discovered. Observational evidence indicates that most of these low-mass WDs are found in binary systems, supporting binary evolution scenarios as the primary formation pathway. A few extremely low-mass (ELM) WDs in this population have also been found to be pulsationally variable. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis aimed at identifying new variable low-mass WDs. From our candidate selection, we observed 16 objects identified within the ZZ Ceti instability strip. These objects were observed over multiple nights using high-speed photometry from the SOAR/Goodman and SMARTS-1m telescopes. Our analysis led to the discovery of three new pulsating WDs: one pulsating ELM, one low-mass WD, and one ZZ Ceti star. Additionally, we identified three objects in binary systems: two with ellipsoidal variations in their light curves, one of which is likely a pre-ELM star, and a third showing a reflection effect.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Typical uncertainties of ages determined for single star giants from isochrone fitting using single-epoch spectroscopy and photometry without any additional constraints are 30-50 %. Binary systems, particularly double-lined spectroscopic (SB2) binaries, provide an opportunity to study the intricacies of internal stellar physics and better determine stellar parameters, particularly the stellar age. Aims. By using the constraints from binarity and asteroseismology, we aim to obtain precise age and stellar parameters for the red giant-subgiant binary system KIC 9163796, a system with a mass ratio of 1.015 but distinctly different positions in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD). Methods. We compute a multidimensional model grid of individual stellar models. From different combinations of figures of merit, we use the constraints drawn from binarity, spectroscopy, and asteroseismology to determine the stellar mass, chemical composition, and age of KIC 9163796. Results. Our combined-modeling approach leads to an age estimation of the binary system KIC 9163796 of 2.44$^{+0.25}_{-0.20}$ Gyr, which corresponds to a relative error in the age of 9 %. Furthermore, we found both components exhibiting equal initial helium abundance of 0.27 to 0.30, significantly higher than the primordial helium abundance, and an initial heavy metal abundance below the spectroscopic value. The masses of our models are in agreement with masses derived from the asteroseismic scaling relations. Conclusions. By exploiting the unique, distinct positions of KIC 9163796, we successfully demonstrated that combining asteroseismic and binary constraints leads to a significant improvement of precision in age estimation, that have a relative error below 10% for a giant star.
