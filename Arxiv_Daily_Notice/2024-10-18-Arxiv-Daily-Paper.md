#### Title:
          Jupiter Evolutionary Models Incorporating Stably Stratified Regions

 - **Abstract**
 We address the issue of which broad set of initial conditions for the planet Jupiter best matches the current presence of a ``fuzzy core" of heavy elements, while at the same time comporting with measured parameters such as its effective temperature, atmospheric helium abundance, radius, and atmospheric metallicity. Our focus is on the class of fuzzy cores that can survive convective mixing to the present day and on the unique challenges of an inhomogeneous Jupiter with stably-stratified regions now demanded by the \textit{Juno} gravity data. Hence, using the new code \texttt{APPLE}, we attempt to put a non-adiabatic Jupiter into an evolutionary context. This requires not only a mass density model, the major relevant byproduct of the \textit{Juno} data, but a thermal model that is subject to interior heat transport, a realistic atmospheric flux boundary, a helium rain algorithm, and the latest equation of state. The result is a good fit to most major thermal, compositional, and structural constraints that still preserve a fuzzy core and that should inform future more detailed models of the current Jupiter in the context of its evolution from birth.

 - **Abstract**
 A transiting planet invites us to measure its size, mass, orbital parameters, atmospheric composition, and other characteristics. But the invitation can only be accepted if the host star is bright enough for precise measurements of its flux and spectrum. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is dedicated to finding such favorable systems. Operating from a 13.7-day elliptical orbit around the Earth, TESS uses four 10.5 cm telescopes to capture optical images of a 24 x 96 degree field of view. By shifting the field of view every 27 days, TESS can survey most of the sky every few years. In its first six years, TESS has identified approximately 7,000 planet candidates, with several hundred confirmed as planets. Mass measurements of these planets allow astronomers to differentiate between rocky "super-Earths" and gas-rich or volatile-rich "mini-Neptunes," while observations with the James Webb Space Telescope are revealing the secrets of their atmospheres. TESS has discovered planets orbiting a wide range of stars, including young stars, low-mass stars, binary stars, and even a white dwarf star. Beyond planet detection, TESS probes the optical variability of stars and a diverse array of other astronomical objects, including asteroids, comets, supernovae, and active galactic nuclei.

          Prevention is better than cure? Feedback from high specific energy winds in cosmological simulations with Arkenstone

 - **Abstract**
 We deploy the new Arkenstone galactic wind model in cosmological simulations for the first time, allowing us to robustly resolve the evolution and impact of high specific energy winds. In a (25$\,h^{-1}\,$Mpc)$^3$ box we perform a set of numerical experiments that systematically vary the mass and energy loadings of such winds, finding that their energy content is the key parameter controlling the stellar to dark matter mass ratio. Increasing the mass loading, at fixed energy, actually results in mildly enhanced star formation, counter to prevailing wisdom but in agreement with recent analytic models. Of the simple parametrisations that we test, we find that an energy loading that scales inversely with halo mass best matches a wide range of observations, and can do so with mass loadings drastically lower than those in most previous cosmological simulations. In this scenario, much less material is ejected from the interstellar medium. Instead, winds both heat gas in the circumgalactic medium, slowing infall onto the galaxy, and also drive shocks beyond the virial radius, preventing accretion onto the halo in the first place. We have not yet tied the mass and energy loadings to high-resolution simulations (a key goal of the Learning the Universe collaboration); however, we can already report that a much lower fraction of the available supernova energy is needed in preventative galaxy regulation than required by ejective wind feedback models such as IllustrisTNG.

          Probe of spatial geometry from scalar induced gravitational waves

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a novel probe of spatial geometry of the Universe through the observation of gravitational waves (GWs) induced by first order curvature perturbations. The existence of spatial curvature leaves imprints on the gravitational wave spectrum and formation of primordial black holes. Given the peaked scalar spectrum, the induced spectrum deviates from the flat space power spectrum and the deviation is dependent on the spatial curvature K and reheating temperature $T_{rh}$. For prolonged reheating and negative spatial curvature the spectrum is amplified enough and exhibits an additional peak solely due to K indicating a possible detection by future gravitational wave experiments including LISA and DECIGO. We also observe that the presence of negative spatial curvature improves the constraints on PBH formation, increasing the mass of black holes which are viable dark matter candidates.

          The masses of open star clusters and their tidal tails and the stellar initial mass function

 - **Abstract**
 Unresolved binaries have a strong influence on the observed parameters of stellar clusters (SCs). We quantify this influence and compute the resulting mass underestimates and stellar mass function (MF). N-body simulations of realistic SCs were used to investigate the evolution of the binary population in a SC and its tidal tails. Together with an empirically gauged stellar mass-luminosity relation, the results were then used to determine how the presence of binaries changes the photometric mass and MF of the SC and its tails as deduced from observations. Tail 1 (T1), which is the tidal tail caused by gas expulsion, contains a larger fraction of binaries than both the SC and tail 2 (T2), which forms after gas expulsion. Additionally, T1 has a larger velocity dispersion. Using the luminosity of an unresolved binary, an observer would underestimate its mass. This bias sensitively depends on the companion masses due to the structure of the stellar mass-luminosity relation. Combining the effect of all binaries in the simulation, the total photometric mass of the SC is underestimated by 15%. Dark objects (black holes/neutron stars) increase the difference between the real and observed mass of the SC further. For both the SC and the tails, the observed power-law index of the MF between a stellar mass of 0.3 and 0.7 $M_\odot$ is smaller by up to 0.2 than the real one, the real initial mass function (IMF) being steeper by this amount. This difference is larger for stars with a larger velocity dispersion or binary fraction. Since the stars formed in SCs are the progenitors of the Galactic field stars, this work suggests that the binary fractions of different populations of stars in the Galactic disc will differ as a function of the velocity dispersion. The direction of this correlation is currently unclear and a complete population synthesis will be needed to investigate this effect.

          Failed supernova explosions increase the duration of star formation in globular clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The duration of star formation (SF) in globular clusters (GCs) is an essential aspect for understanding their formation. Contrary to previous presumptions that all stars above 8 M explode as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), recent evidence suggests a more complex scenario. Aims. We analyse iron spread observations from 55 GCs to estimate the number of CCSNe explosions before SF termination, thereby determining the SF duration. This work for the first time takes the possibility of failed CCSNe into account, when estimating the SF duration. Methods. Two scenarios are considered: one where all stars explode as CCSNe and another where only stars below 20 M lead to CCSNe, as most CCSN models predict that no failed CCSNe happen below 20 M . Results. This establishes a lower ($\approx$ 3.5 Myr) and an upper ($\approx$ 10.5 Myr) limit for the duration of SF. Extending the findings of our previous paper, this study indicates a significant difference in SF duration based on CCSN outcomes, with failed CCSNe extending SF by up to a factor of three. Additionally, a new code is introduced to compute the SF duration for a given CCSN model. Conclusions. The extended SF has important implications on GC formation, including enhanced pollution from stellar winds and increased binary star encounters. These results underscore the need for a refined understanding of CCSNe in estimating SF durations and the formation of multiple stellar populations in GCs.

 - **Abstract**
 This introductory guide aims to provide insight to new researchers in the field of cosmic microwave background (CMB) map analysis on best practices for several common procedures. I will discuss common map-modifying procedures such as masking, downgrading resolution, the effect of the beam and the pixel window function, and adding white noise. I will explore how these modifications affect the final power spectrum measured from a map. This guide aims to describe the best way to perform each of these procedures, when the different steps and measures should be carried out, and the effects of incorrectly performing or applying any of them.

          Energy equipartition in multiple-population globular clusters

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of Monte Carlo simulations aimed at exploring the evolution towards energy equipartition of first- (1G) and second-generation (2G) stars in multiple-population globular clusters and how this evolution is affected by the initial differences between the spatial distributions of the two populations. Our results show that these initial differences have fundamental implications for the evolution towards energy equipartition of the two populations. We find that 2G stars, which are assumed to be initially more centrally concentrated than 1G stars, are generally characterized by a more rapid evolution towards energy equipartition. The evolution towards energy equipartition depends on the velocity dispersion component and is more rapid for the tangential velocity dispersion. The extent of the present-day differences between the degree of energy equipartition of 2G and 1G stars depends on the cluster's dynamical age and may be more significant in the tangential velocity dispersion and at intermediate distances from the cluster's center around the half-mass radius.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomical solutions provide calculated orbital and rotational parameters of solar system bodies based on the dynamics and physics of the solar system. Application of astronomical solutions in the Earth sciences has revolutionized our understanding in at least two areas of active research. (i) The Astronomical (or Milankovic) forcing of climate on time scales > ~10 kyr and (ii) the dating of geologic archives. The latter has permitted the development of the astronomical time scale, widely used today to reconstruct highly accurate geological dates and chronologies. The tasks of computing vs. applying astronomical solutions are usually performed by investigators from different backgrounds, which has led to confusion and recent inaccurate results on the side of the applications. Here we review astronomical solutions and Milankovic forcing in the Earth sciences, primarily aiming at clarifying the astronomical basis, applicability, and limitations of the solutions. We provide a summary of current up-to-date and outdated astronomical solutions and their valid time span. We discuss the fundamental limits imposed by dynamical solar system chaos on astronomical calculations and geological/astrochronological applications. We illustrate basic features of chaotic behavior using a simple mechanical system, i.e., the driven pendulum. Regarding so-called astronomical "metronomes", we point out that the current evidence does not support the notion of generally stable and prominent metronomes for universal use in astrochronology and cyclostratigraphy. We also describe amplitude and frequency modulation of astronomical forcing signals and the relation to their expression in cyclostratigraphic sequences. Furthermore, the various quantities and terminology associated with Earth's axial precession are discussed in detail. Finally, we provide some suggestions regarding practical considerations.

          Galaxy Mass Modelling from Multi-Wavelength JWST Strong Lens Analysis: Dark Matter Substructure, Angular Mass Complexity, or Both?

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze two galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses, SPT0418-47 and SPT2147-50, using JWST NIRCam imaging across multiple filters. To account for angular complexity in the lens mass distribution, we introduce multipole perturbations with orders $m=1, 3, 4$. Our results show strong evidence for angular mass complexity in SPT2147, with multipole strengths of 0.3-1.7 $\%$ for $m=3, 4$ and 2.4-9.5 $\%$ for $m=1$, while SPT0418 shows no such preference. We also test lens models that include a dark matter substructure, finding a strong preference for a substructure in SPT2147-50 with a Bayes factor (log-evidence change) of $\sim 60$ when multipoles are not included. Including multipoles reduces the Bayes factor to $\sim 11$, still corresponding to a $5\sigma$ detection of a subhalo with an NFW mass of $\log_{10}(M_{200}/M_{\odot}) = 10.87\substack{+0.53\\ -0.71}$. While SPT2147-50 may represent the fourth detection of a dark matter substructure in a strong lens, further analysis is needed to confirm that the signal is not due to systematics associated with the lens mass model.

 - **Abstract**
 A new Cherenkov telescope of the SPHERE type is under development. Its main goal is to promote the solution of the problem of the primary cosmic ray mass composition at ultra high energies (1--100 PeV) using a newly developed technique of the primary mass assignment to EAS event on event-by-event basis. The telescope will carry out measurements of both the Cherenkov light reflected from the snow surface as well as the direct one. Sensitivity of the direct Cherenkov images' shapes to the primary mass is demonstrated.

 - **Abstract**
 At frequencies below 1\,Hz, fluctuations in atmospheric emission in the Chajnantor region in northern Chile are the primary source of interference for bolometric millimeter-wave observations. This paper focuses on the statistics of these fluctuations using measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) water vapor radiometer. After introducing a method for separating atmospheric effects from other systematic effects, we present a direct measurement of the temporal outer scale of turbulence of $\tau_0\approx50$s corresponding to a spatial scale of $L_0\approx500$m. At smaller scales, the fluctuations are well described by the Kolmogorov 2/3 power law until, at yet smaller scales, the effects of beam smearing become important. As a part of this study, we present measurements of the atmosphere by the APEX radiometer over 20 years, focused on fluctuations in precipitable water vapor (PWV). We find that the 30-minute mean of the total PWV is not in general a robust estimator of the level of fluctuations. We show that the microwave frequency spectrum of these fluctuations is in good agreement with predictions by the \texttt{am} code for bands above 90~GHz. We then show that the variance of fluctuations in ACT's mm-wave bands correlates with the variance of fluctuations in PWV measured by APEX, even though the observatories are 6\,km apart and observe different lines of sight. We find that ACT's atmosphere-determined optical efficiencies are consistent with previous planet-based results.

          Chemical abundances of 20 barium stars from the OHP spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the high resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra, we derived the chemical abundances of 20 elements for 20 barium (Ba-) stars. For the first time, the detailed abundances of four sample stars, namely HD 92482, HD 150430, HD 151101 and HD 177304 have been analyzed. Additionally, Ba element abundance has been measured using high resolution spectra for the first time in six of the other 16 sample stars. Based on the [s/Fe] ratios, the Ba-unknown star HD 115927 can be classified as a strong Ba-star, while the Ba-likely star HD 160538 can be categorized into a mild Ba-star. Consequently, our sample comprises three strong and 17 mild Ba-stars. The light odd-Z metal elements and Fe-peak elements exhibit near-solar abundances. The [{\alpha}/Fe] ratios demonstrate decreasing trends with increasing metallicity. Moreover, the abundances of n-capture elements show significant enhancements in different degrees. Using a threshold of the signed distances to the solar r-process abundance pattern ds = 0.6, we find that all of our sample stars are normal Ba-stars, indicating that the enhancements of s-process elements should be attributed to material transfer from their companions. We compare the observed n-capture patterns of sample stars with the FRUITY models, and estimate the mass of the Thermally-Pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch stars that previously contaminated the Ba-stars. The models with low masses can successfully explain the observations. From a kinematic point of view, we note that most of our sample stars are linked with the thin disk, while HD 130255 may be associated with the thick disk.

          A statistical study on the peak and fluence spectra of Solar Energetic Particles observed over 4 solar cycles

 - **Abstract**
 Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are an important space radiation source, especially for the space weather environment in the inner heliosphere. The energy spectrum of SEP events is crucial both for evaluating their radiation effects and for understanding their acceleration process at the source region and their propagation mechanism. In this work, we investigate the properties of the SEP peak flux spectra and the fluence spectra and their potential formation mechanisms using statistical methods. We aim to advance our understanding of both SEPs' acceleration and propagation mechanisms. Employing the dataset of European Space Agency's Solar Energetic Particle Environment Modelling (SEPEM) program, we have obtained and fitted the peak-flux and fluence proton spectra of more than a hundred SEP events from 1974 to 2018. We analyzed the relationship among the solar activity, X-ray peak intensity of solar flares and the SEP spectral parameters. Based on the assumption that the initial spectrum of accelerated SEPs generally has a power-law distribution and also the diffusion coefficient has a power-law dependence on particle energy, we can assess both the source and propagation properties using the observed SEP event peak flux and fluence energy spectra. We confirm that SEPs' spectral properties are influenced by the solar source and the interplanetary conditions and their transportation process can be influenced by different phases of solar cycle. This study provides an observational perspective on the double power-law spectral characteristics of the SEP energy spectra, showing their correlation with the adiabatic cooling and diffusion processes during the particle propagation from the Sun to the observer. This contributes to a deeper understanding of the acceleration and propagation of SEP events, in particular the possible origins of the double-power law.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from a high-resolution interstellar turbulence simulation and show that it closely reproduces recent $Planck$ measurements. Our model captures the scaling of $EE$ and $BB$ spectra, and the $EE/BB$ ratio in the inertial range. The PDF of the dust polarization fraction is also consistent with observations. The $TE$ cross-correlation is in broad agreement with observations. This simulation provides new insights into the physical origins of the observed $E/B$ asymmetry and positive $TE$ signal, facilitating the development of advanced Galactic dust emission models for current and future CMB experiments.

          The cloud cover and meteorological parameters at the Lenghu site on the Tibetan Plateau

 - **Abstract**
 The cloud cover and meteorological parameters serve as fundamental criteria for the qualification of an astronomical observatory working in optical and infrared wavelengths. In this paper, we present a systematic assessment of key meteorological parameters at the Lenghu site. The datasets adopted in this study includes the meteorological parameters collected at the local weather stations at the site and in the Lenghu Town, the sky brightness at the local zenith acquired by the Sky Quality Meters and night sky all-sky images from a digital camera, the ERA5 reanalysis database and global climate monitoring data. From 2019 to 2023, the fractional observable time of photometric condition is 69.70%, 74.97%, 70.26%, 74.27% and 65.12%, respectively. The fractional observing time is inversely correlated with surface air temperature, relative humidity, precipitable water vapor, and dew temperature, demonstrating that the observing conditions are influenced by these meteorological parameters. Large-scale air-sea interactions affect the climate at Lenghu site, which in fact delivers a clue to understand the irregularity of 2023. Specifically, precipitable water vapor at Lenghu site is correlated to both the westerly wind index and the summer North Atlantic Oscillation index, the yearly average temperature of Lenghu site is observed to increase significantly during the occurrence of a strong El Niño event and the relative humidity anomaly at Lenghu site is correlated to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index. The decrease of fractional observing time in 2023 was due to the ongoing strong El Niño event and relevant global climate change. We underscore the substantial role of global climate change in regulating astronomical observing conditions and the necessity for long-term continuous monitoring of the astronomical meteorological parameters at Lenghu site.

          Wavelet analysis of low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in MAXI J1803$-$298 observed with Insight-HXMT and NICER

 - **Abstract**
 With data observed by the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (\textit{Insight}-HXMT) and the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (\textit {NICER}), we study low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) of the black hole candidate MAXI J1803$-$298 during the 2021 outburst. Based on hardness intensity diagram and difference of the QPOs properties, Type-C and Type-B QPOs are found in the low-hard state and soft intermediate state, respectively. After searching for and classifying QPOs in Fourier domains, we extract the QPO component and study it with wavelet analysis. The QPO and no-QPO time intervals are separated by the confidence level, so that the S-factor, which is defined as the ratio of the QPO time interval to the total length of good time interval, is calculated. We found S-factors decrease with QPOs frequency for Type-C QPOs but stay stable around zero for Type-B QPOs. The relation of S-factor of Type-C QPOs and photon energy, the correlation of S-factor and counts are also studied. Different correlation of S-factor and counts for different energy bands indicates different origins of QPOs in high energy and low energy bands, which may be due to a dual-corona scenario.

          A Neutron Capture Explanation for the 10 MeV Emission Line Seen in GRB 221009A

 - **Abstract**
 The brightest ever gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A displays a significant emission line component around 10 MeV. As the GRB central engine is neutron-rich, we propose that the emission line could be originally due to the 2.223 MeV gamma-rays following neutron capture with protons. The measured line profile can be adequately fitted with a neutron capture model that involves thermal broadening and a bulk Doppler shift. The spectral modeling reveals a Doppler factor varying from 5.1 to 2.1 for the neutron-rich component, along with a temperature increase from 300 keV to about 900 keV, during the time interval of 280--360 s since the trigger, with about $10^{-2}$ $M_\odot$ deuteriums produced in the process. We argue that neutron capture can take place in the outer shell of a structure jet. Disk winds could be another possible site.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gamma-Ray Integrated Detectors (GRID) are a space science mission that employs compact gamma-ray detectors mounted on NanoSats in low Earth orbit (LEO) to monitor the transient gamma-ray sky. Owing to the unpredictability of the time and location of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), obtaining the photon responses of gamma-ray detectors at various incident angles is important for the scientific analysis of GRB data captured by GRID detectors. For this purpose, a dedicated Monte Carlo simulation framework has been developed for GRID detectors. By simulating each GRID detector and the NanoSat carrying it, the spectral energy response, detection efficiency, and other angular responses of each detector for photons with different incident angles and energies can be obtained within this framework. The accuracy of these simulations has been corroborated through on-ground calibration, and the derived angular responses have been successfully applied to the data analysis of recorded GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 The increased brightness temperature of young rocky protoplanets during their magma ocean epoch makes them potentially amenable to atmospheric characterization to distances from the solar system far greater than thermally equilibrated terrestrial exoplanets, offering observational opportunities for unique insights into the origin of secondary atmospheres and the near surface conditions of prebiotic environments. The Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) mission will employ a space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometer to directly measure the thermal emission of terrestrial exoplanets. Here, we seek to assess the capabilities of various instrumental design choices of the LIFE mission concept for the detection of cooling protoplanets with transient high-temperature magma ocean atmospheres, in young stellar associations in particular. Using the LIFE mission instrument simulator (LIFEsim) we assess how specific instrumental parameters and design choices, such as wavelength coverage, aperture diameter, and photon throughput, facilitate or disadvantage the detection of protoplanets. We focus on the observational sensitivities of distance to the observed planetary system, protoplanet brightness temperature using a blackbody assumption, and orbital distance of the potential protoplanets around both G- and M-dwarf stars. Our simulations suggest that LIFE will be able to detect (S/N $\geq$ 7) hot protoplanets in young stellar associations up to distances of $\approx$100 pc from the solar system for reasonable integration times (up to $\sim$hours). Detection of an Earth-sized protoplanet orbiting a solar-sized host star at 1 AU requires less than 30 minutes of integration time. M-dwarfs generally need shorter integration times. The contribution from wavelength regions $<$6 $\mu$m is important for decreasing the detection threshold and discriminating emission temperatures.

          Exploring the supernova remnant contribution to the first LHAASO source catalog via passively illuminated interstellar clouds

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants (SNRs) are considered as the most promising source class to account for the bulk of the Galactic cosmic-ray flux. Yet amongst the population of ultra-high energy (UHE) sources that has recently emerged, due to high-altitude particle detector experiments such as LHAASO and HAWC, remarkably few are associated with known SNRs. These observations might well indicate that the highest energy particles would escape the remnant early during the shock evolution as a result of its reduced confinement capabilities. This flux of escaping particles may then encounter dense targets (gas and dust) for hadronic interactions in the form of both atomic and molecular material such as interstellar clouds, thereby generating a UHE gamma-ray flux. We explore such a scenario here, considering known SNRs in a physically driven model for particle escape, and as coupled to molecular clouds in the Galaxy. Our analysis allows the investigation of SNR-illuminated clouds in coincidence with sources detected in the first LHAASO catalogue. Indeed, the illuminated interstellar clouds may contribute to the total gamma-ray flux from several unidentified sources, as we discuss here. Yet we nevertheless find that further detailed studies will be necessary to verify or refute this scenario of passive UHE gamma-ray sources in future.

 - **Abstract**
 The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA), part of the Pierre Auger Observatory, is a facility designed to detect radio emissions from extensive air showers at high energies. Consisting of 153 autonomous radio-detector stations spread over 17 km$^2$, it detects radio waves in the frequency range of 30 to 80 MHz. Accurate characterization of the detector response is essential for correct data interpretation, previously achieved through laboratory measurements of the analog chain and measurements of the antenna's directional response. In this study, we perform an absolute calibration using the continuously monitored sidereal modulation of the diffuse Galactic radio emission. Calibration is done by comparing the average spectra recorded by the stations with seven different models of the full radio sky propagated through the system response, including antennas, filters, and amplifiers. The Galactic calibration is in good agreement with the original laboratory calibration. In addition, we analyze the time-dependence of the calibration constants over a period of seven years. No aging effects are observed in AERA stations over a timescale of a decade, which shows that radio detectors could help monitor possible aging effects of other detector systems during long-term operations and highlight their importance in determining an absolute cosmic-ray energy scale.

 - **Abstract**
 lightcurver is a photometric pipeline for time series astronomical imaging data, designed for the semi-automatic extraction of precise light curves from small, blended targets. Such targets include, but are not limited to, lensed quasars, supernovae, or Cepheids in crowded fields. lightcurver leverages STARRED (Michalewicz et al., 2023; Millon et al., 2024) to generate state-of-the-art empirical point spread function (PSF) models for each image. It then determines the relative zeropoints between epochs by combining the PSF-photometry fluxes of several stars in the field of view. Subsequently, STARRED is used again to simultaneously model the calibrated pixels of the region of interest across all epochs. This process yields light curves of the point sources and a high-resolution image model of the region of interest, cumulating the signal from all epochs. lightcurver aims to be maintainable, fast, and incremental in its processing approach. As such, it can enable the daily photometric analysis of a large number of blended targets in the context of the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

          Is the $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological parameterization evidence for dark energy dynamics partially caused by the excess smoothing of Planck CMB anisotropy data?

 - **Abstract**
 We study the performance of the spatially-flat dynamical dark energy (DE) $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, with redshift-dependent DE fluid equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$, with and without a varying CMB lensing consistency parameter $A_L$, against Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (P18 and lensing) and a combination of non-CMB data composed of baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements that do not include DESI BAO data, Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNIa) observations, Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] measurements, and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) data points. From our most restrictive data set, P18+lensing+non-CMB, for the $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ parameterization, we obtain $w_0=-0.879\pm 0.060$, $w_a=-0.39^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$, the asymptotic limit $w(z\to\infty) = w_0+w_a=-1.27^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$, and $A_L=1.078^{+0.036}_{-0.040}$ (all $1\sigma$ errors). This joint analysis of CMB and non-CMB data favors DE dynamics over a cosmological constant at $\sim 1\sigma$ and $A_L>1$ at $\sim 2\sigma$, i.e. more smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data than is predicted by the best-fit model. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$ the evidence in favor of DE dynamics is larger, $\sim 2\sigma$, suggesting that at least part of the evidence for DE dynamics comes from the excess smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$, there is a difference of $2.8\sigma$ between P18 and non-CMB cosmological parameter constraints and $2.7\sigma$ between P18+lensing and non-CMB constraints. When $A_L$ is allowed to vary these tensions reduced to $1.9\sigma$ and $2.1\sigma$ respectively. Our P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation positively favors the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization without and with a varying $A_L$ parameter over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ is also positively favored over $w_0w_a$CDM.

 - **Abstract**
 We utilize serendipitous observations from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in addition to targeted follow-up observations from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) and Liverpool Telescope to analyze the first observed instance of cometary activity by the newly-discovered Jupiter-family comet C/2023 RN3 (ATLAS), whose orbital dynamics place it close to residing on a Centaur-like orbit. Across our 7-month baseline, we observe an epoch of cometary activity commencing in August 2023 with an increase in brightness of >5.4 mag. The lightcurve of 2023 RN3 indicates the presence of continuous cometary activity across our observations, suggesting the onset of a new period of sustained activity. We find no evidence of any outbursts on top of the observed brightening, nor do we find any significant color evolution across our observations. 2023 RN3 is visibly extended in LCO and Liverpool Telescope observations, indicating the presence of a spatially-extended coma. Numerical integration of 2023 RN3's orbit reveals the comet to have recently undergone a slight increase in semimajor axis due to a planetary encounter with Jupiter, however whether this orbital change could trigger 2023 RN3's cometary activity is unclear. Our estimate for the maximum dust production metric of Afrho ~400 cm is consistent with previous measurements for the Jupiter-family comet and Centaur populations.

 - **Abstract**
 We compute and apply the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the binary millisecond pulsar population, and discuss aspects of the known phenomenology of these systems in this context. We find that the MST effectively separates different classes of spider pulsars, eclipsing radio pulsars in tight binary systems either with a companion with a mass in the range of approximately 0.1-0.8 solar masses (redbacks) or with a companion of less than or approximately 0.06 solar masses (black widows), into distinct branches. The MST also separates black widows located in globular clusters from those found in the field and groups other pulsar classes of interest, including transitional millisecond pulsars. Using the MST and a defined ranking for similarity, we identify possible candidates likely to belong to these pulsar classes. In particular, based on this approach, we propose the black widows' classification of J1300+1240, J1630+3550, J1317-0157, J1221-0633, J1627+3219, J1737-0314A, and J1701-3006F, discuss that of J1908+2105, and analyze J1723-2837, J1431-4715, and J1902-5105 as possible transitional systems. We introduce an algorithm that quickly locates where new pulsars fall within the MST and use this to examine the positions of the transitional millisecond pulsar IGR J18245-2452 (PSR J1824-2452I), the transitional millisecond pulsar candidate 3FGL J1544.6-1125, and the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. Assessing the positions of these sources in the MST assuming a range for their unknown variables (e.g., the spin period derivative of PSR J1824-2452I) we can effectively narrow down the parameter space necessary for searching and determining key pulsar parameters through targeted observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We simulate the distribution of very rare, large excursions in the primordial density field produced in models of inflation in the very early universe which include a strong enhancement of the power spectrum. The stochastic $\delta \mathcal{N}$ formalism is used to identify the probability distribution for the primordial curvature perturbation with the first-passage-time distribution, $P(\delta \mathcal{N})$, and we compare our stochastic results with those obtained in the classical $\delta \mathcal{N}$ approach. We extend the PyFPT numerical code to simulate the full 2D phase space, and apply importance sampling which allows very rare fluctuations to be simulated in $\mathcal{O}(10)$ minutes on a single CPU, where previous direct simulations required supercomputers. We demonstrate that the stochastic noise due to quantum fluctuations after a sudden transition to ultra-slow roll can be accurately modelled using an analytical Bessel-function ansatz to identify the homogeneous growing mode. The stochastic noise found in this way is a function of the field value only. This enables us to coarse grain the inflation field at the Hubble scale and include non-linear, stochastic evolution on all super-Hubble length scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a compendium of HI 21-cm line observations of circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of 290 evolved stars, mostly (~84%) on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), made with the 100m-class, single-dish Nancay Radio Telescope. The observational and data reduction procedures were optimised for separating genuine CSE HI emission from surrounding Galactic line features. For most targets (254) the results have not been previously published. Clear detections were made of 34 objects, for 33 of which the total HI flux and the size of the CSE could be determined. Possible detections were made of 21 objects, and upper limits could be determined for 95 undetected targets, while for 140 objects confusion from Galactic HI emission along the line-of-sight precluded meaningful upper limits. The collective results of this survey can provide guidance on detectability of circumstellar HI gas for future mapping and imaging studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We report that the gas components in the N59 bubble suffered from sequential multiple cloud-cloud collision (CCC) processes. The molecular gas in the N59 bubble can be decomposed into four velocity components, namely Cloud A [95, 108] km s$^{-1}$, Cloud B [86, 95] km s$^{-1}$, Cloud C [79, 86] km s$^{-1}$ and Cloud D [65, 79] km s$^{-1}$. Four CCC processes occurred among these four velocity components, i.e., Cloud A vs. Cloud B, Cloud A vs. Cloud C, Cloud C vs. Cloud D, and Cloud A vs. Cloud D. Using Spitzer MIR and UKIDSS NIR photometric point source catalogs, we identified 514 YSO candidates clustered in 13 YSO groups, and most of them (~60$\%$) were located at the colliding interfaces, indicating that they were mainly triggered by these four CCC processes. We also found that these four collisions occurred in a time sequential order: the earliest and most violent collision occurred between Cloud A and Cloud D about 2 Myr ago, then Cloud B collided with Cloud A about 1 Myr ago, and finally, Cloud C collided with Clouds A and D simultaneously about 0.4 Myr ago.

          On the crystallization onset in white dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 Thermal evolution of the central region of a $0.9 \, M_\odot$ C/O white dwarf at the initial stage of the ion mixture crystallization is studied by numerically solving the heat equation on a fine spatial and temporal grid and by including a detailed treatment of the latent heat release. Formation of two spherical shells is observed. The outer one surrounds a region where crystallization has begun. The inner one bounds a fully solidified core which has exhausted its latent heat. The region between the shells is partially liquid and partially solid. It gradually emits the latent heat of crystallization and also it releases light elements (carbon) in the process of element redistribution, accompanying the mixture solidification. Assuming that all released light elements cross the outer shell, we have estimated their flux induced by the mixture crystallization. The resulting flux is not divergent and is much smaller than an estimate derived from the growth rate of the fully crystallized core.

          BayeSN and SALT: A Comparison of Dust Inference Across SN Ia Light-curve Models with DES5YR

 - **Abstract**
 We apply the probabilistic hierarchical SN Ia SED model BayeSN to analyse SALT-based simulations of SNe Ia to probe consistency between the two models. This paper is the first cross-comparison of dust inference methods using SALT and BayeSN, of great importance given the history of conflicting conclusions regarding the distributions of host galaxy dust properties between the two. Overall we find that BayeSN is able to accurately recover our simulated SALT inputs, establishing excellent consistency between the two models. When inferring dust parameters with simulated samples including non-Ia contamination, we find that our choice of photometric classifier causes a bias in the inferred dust distribution; this arises because SNe Ia heavily impacted by dust are misclassified as contaminants and excluded. We then apply BayeSN to a sample of SNe from DES5YR to jointly infer host galaxy dust distributions and intrinsic differences on either side of a `mass step' at $10^{10}$ M$\odot$. We find evidence in favour of an intrinsic contribution to the mass step and a considerably smaller difference in $R_V$ distributions than most SALT-based analyses, at most $\Delta\mu_{R_V}=0.72\pm0.26$. We also build on recent results in favour of an environmental-dependence on the secondary maximum of SNe Ia in $i$-band. Twenty days post-peak, we find a offset in intrinsic $i$-band light curve between each mass bin at a significance in excess of $3\sigma$.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars presently identified in the bulge spheroid are probably very old, and their abundances can be interpreted as due to the fast chemical enrichment of the early Galactic bulge. The abundances of the iron-peak elements are important tracers of nucleosynthesis processes, in particular oxygen burning, silicon burning, the weak s-process, and alpha-rich freeze-out. Aims. The aim of this work is to derive the abundances of V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Cu in 58 bulge spheroid stars and to compare them with the results of a previous analysis of data from APOGEE. We selected the best lines for V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Cu located within the H-band of the spectrum, identifying the most suitable ones for abundance determination, and discarding severe blends. Using the stellar physical parameters available for our sample from the DR17 release of the APOGEE project, we derived the individual abundances through spectrum synthesis. We then complemented these measurements with similar results from different bulge field and globular cluster stars, in order to define the trends of the individual elements and compare with the results of chemical-evolution models. We verify that the H-band has useful lines for the derivation of the elements V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Cu in moderately metal-poor stars. The resulting abundances indicate that: V, Cr, and Ni vary in lockstep with Fe; Co tends to vary in lockstep with Fe, but could be showing a slight decrease with decreasing metallicity; and Mn and Cu decrease with decreasing metallicity. These behaviours are well reproduced by chemical-evolution models except for Cu, which appears to drop faster than the models predict for moderate metallicities. Finally, abundance indicators combined with kinematical and dynamical criteria appear to show that our 58 sample stars are likely to have originated in situ.

          Impact of stratified rotation on the moment of inertia of neutron stars

 - **Abstract**
 Rigid (Uniform) rotation is usually assumed when investigating the properties of mature neutron stars (NSs). Although it simplifies their description, it is an assumption because we cannot observe the NS's innermost parts. Here, we analyze the structure of NSs in the simple case of ''almost rigidity,'' where the innermost and outermost parts rotate with different angular velocities. This is motivated by the possibility of NSs having superfluid interiors, phase transitions, and angular momentum transfer during accretion processes. We show that, in general relativity, the relative difference in angular velocity between different parts of an NS induces a change in the moment of inertia compared to that of rigid rotation. The relative change depends nonlinearly on where the angular velocity jump occurs inside the NS. For the same observed angular velocity in both configurations, if the jump location is close to the star's surface-which is possible in central compact objects (CCOs) and accreting stars-the relative change in the moment of inertia is close to that of the angular velocity (which is expected due to total angular momentum aspects). If the jump occurs deep within the NS, for instance, due to phase transitions or superfluidity, smaller relative changes in the moment of inertia are observed; we found that if it is at a radial distance smaller than approximately $40\%$ of the star's radius, the relative changes are negligible. Additionally, we outline the relevance of systematic uncertainties that nonrigidity could have on some NS observables, such as radius, ellipticity, and the rotational energy budget of pulsars, which could explain the X-ray luminosity of some sources. Finally, we also show that non-rigidity weakens the universal $I$-Love-$Q$ relations.
