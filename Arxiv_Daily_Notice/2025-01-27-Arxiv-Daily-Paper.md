 - **Abstract**
 We present new theoretical light curves in the Rubin-LSST filters for a fine grid of BL Her models computed using MESA-RSP. We also derive new theoretical period-luminosity (PL) and period-Wesenheit (PW) relations in the Rubin-LSST filters with the goal to study the effect of convection parameters and metallicity on these relations. The grid of BL Her models was computed with the input stellar parameters: metallicity ($-2.0\; \mathrm{dex} \leq \mathrm{[Fe/H]} \leq 0.0\; \mathrm{dex}$), stellar mass ($0.5M_{\odot}-0.8M_{\odot}$), stellar luminosity ($50L_{\odot}-300L_{\odot}$), and effective temperature (across the full extent of the instability strip; in steps of 50K) and using four sets of convection parameters. Bolometric correction tables from MIST were used to transform the theoretical bolometric light curves of the BL Her models into the Rubin-LSST ugrizy filters. The PL relations of the BL Her models exhibit steeper slopes but smaller dispersion with increasing wavelengths in the Rubin-LSST filters. The PL and PW slopes for the complete set of BL Her models computed with radiative cooling (sets B and D) are statistically similar across the grizy filters. The BL Her models exhibit weak or negligible effect of metallicity on the PL relations for wavelengths longer than the g filter for both the cases of the complete set of models as well as the low-mass models. However, we find significant effect of metallicity on the PL relation in the u filter. Strong metallicity effects are observed in the PWZ relations involving the u filter and are found to have significant contribution from the high-metallicity BL Her models. Due to negligible metallicity effect for relations involving the Wesenheit indices $W(i,g-i)$, $W(z,i-z)$ and $W(y,g-y)$, we recommend these filter combinations for BL Her stars when observed with the Rubin-LSST to be used as reliable standard candles.

 - **Abstract**
 Highly-irradiated gas giant exoplanets are predicted to show circulation patterns dominated by day-to-night heat transport and a spatial distribution of clouds that is driven by advection and local heating. Hot-Jupiters have been extensively studied from broadband phase-curve observations at infrared and optical wavelengths, but spectroscopic observations in the reflected light are rare and the regime of smaller and higher-metallicity ultra-hot planets, such as hot-Neptunes, remains largely unexplored to date. Here we present the phase-resolved reflected-light and thermal-emission spectroscopy of the ultra-hot Neptune LTT 9779b, obtained through observing its full phase-curve from 0.6 to 2.8 $\mu$m with JWST NIRISS/SOSS. We detect an asymmetric dayside in reflected light (3.1$\sigma$ significance) with highly-reflective white clouds on the western dayside (A = 0.79$\pm$0.15) and a much lower-albedo eastern dayside (A = 0.41$\pm$0.10), resulting in an overall dayside albedo of A = 0.50$\pm$0.07. The thermal phase curve is symmetric about the substellar point, with a dayside effective temperature of T$_\mathrm{eff,day}$ = 2,260$^{+40}_{-50}$ K and a cold nightside (T$_\mathrm{eff,night}$ <1,330 K at 3-$\sigma$ confidence), indicative of short radiative timescales. We propose an atmospheric circulation and cloud distribution regime in which heat is transported eastward from the dayside towards the cold nightside by an equatorial jet, leading to a colder western dayside where temperatures are sufficiently low for the condensation of silicate clouds.

          Cataclysmic Variables in Triples: Formation Models and New Discoveries

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of cataclysmic variables (CVs) has long been modeled as a product of common envelope evolution (CEE) in isolated binaries. However, a significant fraction of intermediate-mass stars -- the progenitors of the white dwarfs (WDs) in CVs -- are in triples. We therefore investigate the importance of triple star dynamics in CV formation. Using Gaia astrometry and existing CV catalogs, we construct a sample of $\sim50$ CVs in hierarchical triples within 1 kpc of the Sun, containing main-sequence (MS) and WD tertiaries at separations of 100 - 30,000 au. We infer that at least 10% of CVs host wide tertiaries. To interpret this discovery, we evolve a population of 2000 triples using detailed three-body simulations, 47 of which become CVs. We predict that 20% of CVs in triples form without ever experiencing CEE, where the WD and donor are brought together by the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism after the formation of the WD. These systems favor larger donor stars and longer birth orbital periods (8-20 hrs) than typical CVs. Among systems that do undergo CEE, about half would not have interacted without the presence of the tertiary. Triple formation channels both with and without CEE require initially wide inner orbits ($\gtrsim 1$ au), which in turn require larger tertiary separations to be stable. Consistent with this prediction, we find that the observed Gaia CV triples have wider separations on average than normal wide binaries selected in the same way. Our work underscores the importance of triples in shaping interacting binary populations including CVs, ultracompact binaries, and low-mass X-ray binaries.

          The observed phase space of mass-loss history from massive stars based on radio observations of a large supernova sample

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we study the circumstellar material (CSM) around massive stars, and the mass-loss rates depositing this CSM, using a large sample of radio observations of 325 core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe; only $\sim 22 \%$ of them being detected). This sample comprises both archival data and our new observations of 99 CCSNe conducted with the AMI-LA radio array in a systematic approach devised to constrain the mass-loss at different stages of stellar evolution. In the SN-CSM interaction model, observing the peak of the radio emission of a SN provides the CSM density at a given radius (and therefore mass-loss rate that deposited this CSM). On the other hand, limits on the radio emission, and/or on the peak of the radio emission provide a region in the CSM phase space that can be ruled out. Our analysis shows discrepancy between the values of mass-loss rates derived from radio-detected and radio-non-detected SNe. Furthermore, we rule out mass-loss rates in the range of $2 \times 10^{-6} - 10^{-4} \, \rm M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}$ for different epochs during the last 1000 years before the explosion (assuming wind velocity of $10 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$) for the progenitors of $\sim 80\%$ of the type II SNe in our sample. In addition, we rule out the ranges of mass-loss rates suggested for red supergiants for $\sim 50 \%$ of the progenitors of type II SNe in our sample. We emphasize here that these results take a step forward in constraining mass-loss in winds from a statistical point of view.

 - **Abstract**
 Several ground- and space-based searches have increased the number of known exoplanets to nearly 6000. While most are highly unlike our planet, the first rocky worlds in the Habitable Zone (HZ) provide the most intriguing targets for the search for life in the cosmos. As the detections increase, it is critical to probe the HZ as well as its limits empirically using known exoplanets. However, there is not yet a list of rocky worlds that observers can use to probe the limits of surface habitability. We analyze all known exoplanets and identify 67 rocky worlds in the empirical HZ and 38 in a narrower 3D-model HZ. We compare their demographics with the full catalog of exoplanets, analyze their characteristics, give HZ limits for each system, and prioritize targets for observation. We address another critical dimension to this exploration and compile missing stellar age estimates for these candidates. To probe the limits of habitability, we identify several transiting and non-transiting rocky planets that can provide constraints on the inner and outer edge of the HZ, explore how eccentricity influences habitability, and identify the oldest HZ worlds as well as exoplanets with similar flux to modern Earth's. The resulting list of rocky exoplanet targets in the HZ will allow observers to shape and optimize their search strategies with space- and ground-based telescopes -- such as the James Webb Space Telescope, the Extremely Large Telescope, the Habitable Worlds Observatory, and LIFE -- and to design new observing strategies and instruments to explore these intriguing worlds, addressing the question of the limits of surface habitability on exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has produced horizon-resolving images of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A$^*$). Scattering in the turbulent plasma of the interstellar medium distorts the appearance of Sgr A$^*$ on scales only marginally smaller than the fiducial resolution of EHT. Therefore, this process both diffractive blurs and adds stochastic refractive substructures that limits the practical angular resolution of EHT images of Sgr A$^*$. We utilized a novel recurrent neural network machine learning framework to demonstrate that it is possible to mitigate interstellar scattering at wavelengths of $1.3\,{\rm mm}$ near the galactic center up to structures at the scale of $5\mu{as}$ well below the nominal instrumental resolution of EHT, $24\,\mu{\rm as}$.

          An orphan flare from a plasma blob crossing the broad-line region ?

 - **Abstract**
 The blazar 3C 279 is well known for its prolific emission of rapid flares. A particular event occurred on 12/20/2013, exhibiting a large flux increase with a doubling time scale of a few hours, a very hard gamma-ray spectrum, and a time-asymmetric light curve with slow decay, but no significant variations detected in the optical range. We propose a novel scenario to interpret this flare, based on two emission zones, a stationary blob and a moving plasma blob. The stationary blob, located within the BLR, accounts for the low-state emission. The moving blob decouples from the stationary zone, accelerates and crosses the BLR. The high-energy flare is attributed to the variable external Compton emission as the blob moves through the BLR, while variations in the synchrotron emission are negligible. Our interpretation differs from previous interpretations by attributing the flare to the bulk motion and geometry of the external photon fields, without invoking varying electron injection.

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution and origin of serpentine on Mars can provide insights into the planet's aqueous history, habitability, and past climate. In this study, we used dynamic aperture factor analysis/target transformation applied to 15,760 images from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars, followed by validation with the radiance ratio method, to construct a map of Mg-serpentine deposits on Mars. Although relatively rare, Mg-serpentine was detected in diverse geomorphic settings across Noachian and Hesperian-aged terrains in the southern highlands of Mars, implying that serpentinization was active on early Mars and that multiple formation mechanisms may be needed to explain its spatial distribution. We also calculated the amount of H2 produced during the formation of the observed deposits and conclude that serpentinization was likely more widespread on Mars than indicated by the observed distribution.

          Study of the gamma-Ray Radiation Properties of High-redshift Blazars at z>2.5

 - **Abstract**
 We study a sample of 30 high-redshift blazars ($z>2.5$) by means of spectra and the radiation mechanism with Fermi Large Area Telescope $\gamma$-ray observations spanning 15 years. Three models -- the power law, power law with an exponential cutoff, and log-parabola -- are employed to analyze the spectral properties, and most sources exhibit significant curvature. The high-redshift blazars exhibit higher $\gamma$-ray luminosities and softer spectral indices compared with their low-redshift counterparts, where B3~1343+451 has the highest integrated flux, $\rm 1.13 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{\ ph \ cm^{-2} s^{-1}}$. We use a standard one-zone leptonic emission model to reproduce the spectral energy distributions of 23 sources with multiwavelength observations. We find that modeling with infrared seed photons is systematically better than with broad-line region (BLR) photons based on a $\chi^2$ test, which suggests that the $\gamma$-ray-emitting regions are most likely located outside the BLR. The fit results show that high-redshift blazars exhibit higher energy density, jet power, kinetic power, and accretion disk luminosities, along with lower synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC) peak frequencies, relative to their lower-redshift counterparts. We find that blazars with higher accretion disk luminosities tend to have lower IC peak frequencies, leading to more efficient cooling of high-energy electrons. The positive correlation between jet power and accretion disk luminosity further supports the possibility of an accretion-jet connection in these high-redshift sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino quantum kinetics is a rapidly evolving field in computational astrophysics, with a primary focus on collective neutrino oscillations in core-collapse supernovae and post-merger phases of binary neutron star mergers. In recent years, there has been considerable debate concerning resolution dependence in numerical simulations. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive resolution study in both angular- and spatial directions by using two independent schemes of quantum kinetic neutrino transport: finite volume and pseudospectral methods. We complement our discussion by linear stability analysis including inhomogeneous modes. Our result suggests that decreasing spatial resolutions underestimates the growth of flavor instability, and then leads to wrong asymptotic states of flavor conversions, which potentially has a critical impact on astrophysical consequences. We further delve into numerical results of low resolution simulations, that reveals the underlying mechanism responsible for numerical artifacts caused by insufficient resolutions. This study settles the debate on requirements of resolutions and serves as a guideline for numerical modeling of quantum kinetic neutrino transport.

 - **Abstract**
 Star clusters provide unique advantages for investigating Galactic spiral arms, particularly due to their precise ages, positions, and kinematic properties, which are further enhanced by ongoing updates from the astrometric data. In this study, we employ the latest extensive catalogue of open clusters from Gaia DR3 to examine the positional deviations of clusters belonging to different age groups. Additionally, we employ dynamical simulations to probe the evolutionary behavior of spiral arm positions. Our analysis reveals an absence of a theoretical age pattern in the spiral arms traced by open clusters, and the pattern speeds of the spiral arms are consistent with the rotation curve. Both of these results do not align with the predictions of quasi-stationary density wave theory, suggesting a more dynamic or transient arm scenario for the Milky Way. From this perspective, combined with vertex deviation estimates, it appears that the Local arm is in a state of growth. In contrast, the Sagittarius-Carina arm and the Perseus arm exhibit opposing trends. Consequently, we speculate that the Galactic stellar disk does not exhibit a grand-design spiral pattern with a fixed pattern speed, but rather manifests as a multi-armed structure with arms that continuously emerge and dissipate.

 - **Abstract**
 This study comprehensively analyzes Atlas's current orbit, focusing on the secular and resonant perturbations caused by Prometheus, Pandora, and Saturn's oblateness. We performed numerical integration of the exact equations of motion for a dense ensemble of Atlas clone satellites. Through spectral analysis and interpretation of these orbits on dynamical maps, we identified the domain of the 54:53 Prometheus-Atlas and 70:67 Pandora-Atlas mean-motion resonances, showing that Atlas lies on the boundary of the separatrices of each of these resonances. We also identified the domains for the multiplets $\Psi_{1}$, $\Psi_{2}$, $\Psi_{3}$ and $\Psi_{4}$ associated with 70:67 resonance. Additionally, we explored the variation in Prometheus's eccentricity, demonstrating that as eccentricity increases (or decreases) in the 54:53 resonance domain correspondingly decreases (or increases). This combined analysis, between the above mappings, revealed qualitatively the overlap between the 54:53 and 70:67 resonances, which are responsible for the chaotic behavior of Atlas's orbit. We quantified chaotic motion in frequency space and found that the vicinity of Atlas is characterized by weak to moderate chaos, rather than strong chaos. Finally, we investigated Atlas's recent past, considering Prometheus's migration under the influence of Saturn's tidal forces. This analysis reveals several resonances crossed in the past, particularly focusing on the Atlas-Prometheus pair, which exhibited a co-orbital configuration.

          Deciphering the spectral bumps of Galactic cosmic rays through gamma-ray observations of nearby molecular clouds

 - **Abstract**
 The observed spectral bump in cosmic-ray (CR) proton and helium spectra, along with the phase and amplitude evolution of CR dipole anisotropy, provide plausible yet indirect evidence for the presence of a nearby CR source. This study investigates the potential of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) located near the solar system to act as natural probes of CRs from the nearby source, with their gamma-ray emissions serving as indicators of spatial variations in CR flux within the solar neighborhood resulting from this source. We show that a nearby source, accounting for the CR data, could imprint distinct features on the $\gamma$-ray spectra of different GMCs. We expect that these features are detectable by LHAASO and upcoming high-energy $\gamma$-ray observatories, providing a powerful test for the hypothesized nearby source. Notably, we find that determining the energy dependence of the $\gamma$-ray spectral index offers a promising approach to investigate the nearby source and constrain its distance. Conversely, if the spectral bump is a widespread Galactic phenomenon, the energy dependence would exhibit uniformity across all GMCs, distinguishing the underlying mechanism accounting for the spectral bump from the scenario involving a nearby source.

          Spectral properties of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1636-53, XTE J1739-285 and MAXI J1816-195

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated simultaneous NICER plus NuSTAR observations of three neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1636-53, XTE J1739-285 and MAXI J1816-195 using the latest reflection models, with the seed photons feeding into the corona originating from either the neutron star (NS) or the accretion disk. We found that, for the sources in the hard spectral state, more than $\sim$ 50% of the NS photons enter into the corona if NS provides seed photons, while only $\sim$ 3%-5% disk photons go to the corona if seed photons come from the disk. This finding, together with the derived small height of the corona, favors the lamp-post geometry or boundary layer scenario where the corona is close to the central neutron star. Additionally, we found that the source of the seed photons has big influence in the significance of the NS radiation, especially for the soft spectral state. This result may help explain why the NS radiation in MAXI J1816-195 is weak in the previous work. More importantly, for the first time, we explored the properties of the corona in the NS systems with the compactness ($l-\theta$) diagram. We found that the corona in the NS systems all lie in the left side of the pair-production forbidden region, away from the predicted pair-production lines. This finding indicates that either the corona in these NS systems is not pair-dominated, possibly due to the additional cooling from NS photons, or the corona is composed of both thermal and non-thermal electrons.

 - **Abstract**
 The sources of cosmic rays between the knee and the ankle are still debated. The Galactic wind and its termination shock have been proposed to contribute to this transition between Galactic and extragalactic origin, but another possibility is large-scale shock structures from local sources in the Milky Way. In this paper, we investigate CR transport in a time-dependent landscape of shocks in the Galactic halo. These shocks could result from local outbursts, e.g. starforming regions and superbubbles. CRs re-accelerated at such shocks can reach energies above the knee. Since the shocks are closer to the Galaxy than a termination shock and CRs escape downstream, they can propagate back more easily. With such outbursts happening frequently, shocks will interact. This interaction could adjust the CR spectrum, particularly for the particles that are able to be accelerated at two shocks simultaneously. The transport and acceleration of CRs at the shock is modeled by Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) within the public CR propagation framework CRPropa. We developed extensions for time-dependent wind profiles and for the first time connected the code to hydrodynamic simulations, which were run with the public Athena++ code. We find that, depending on the concrete realization of the diffusion tensor, a significant fraction of CRs can make it back to the Galaxy. These could contribute to the observed spectrum around and above the CR knee ($E \gtrsim 10\,\mathrm{PeV}$). In contrast to simplified models, a simple power-law does not describe the energy spectra well. Instead, for single shocks, we find a flat spectrum ($E^{-2}$) at low energies, which steepens gradually until it reaches an exponential decline. When shocks collide, the energy spectra transiently become harder than $E^{-2}$ at high energies.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs are often found in close binaries with stellar or even substellar companions. It is generally thought that these compact binaries form via common envelope evolution, triggered by the progenitor of the white dwarf expanding after it evolved off the main-sequence and engulfing its companion. To date, a handful of white dwarfs in compact binaries with substellar companions have been found, typically with masses greater than around 50 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$. Here we report the discovery of two eclipsing white dwarf plus brown dwarf binaries containing very low mass brown dwarfs. ZTF J1828+2308 consists of a hot ($15900\pm75$ K) $0.610\pm0.004$ M$_{\odot}$ white dwarf in a 2.7 hour binary with a $0.0186\pm0.0008$ M$_{\odot}$ ($19.5\pm0.8$ M$_\mathrm{Jup}$) brown dwarf. ZTF J1230$-$2655 contains a cool ($10000\pm110$ K) $0.65\pm0.02$ M$_{\odot}$ white dwarf in a 5.7 hour binary with a companion that has a mass of less than 0.0211 M$_{\odot}$ (22.1 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$). While the brown dwarf in ZTF J1828+2308 has a radius consistent with its mass and age, ZTF J1230$-$2655 contains a roughly 20 per cent overinflated brown dwarf for its age. We are only able to reconstruct the common envelope phase for either system if it occurred after the first thermal pulse, when the white dwarf progenitor had already lost a significant fraction of its original mass. This is true even for very high common envelope ejection efficiencies ($\alpha_\mathrm{CE}\sim 1$), unless both systems have extremely low metallicities. It may be that the lowest mass companions can only survive a common envelope phase if it occurs at this very late stage.

 - **Abstract**
 NCORES was a large observing program on the ESO HARPS spectrograph, dedicated to measuring the masses of Neptune-like and smaller transiting planets discovered by the TESS satellite using the radial velocity technique. This paper presents an overview of the programme, its scientific goals and published results, covering 35 planets in 18 planetary systems. We present spectrally derived stellar characterisation and mass constraints for five additional TOIs where radial velocity observations found only marginally significant signals (TOI-510.01, $M_p=1.08^{+0.58}_{-0.55}M_\oplus$), or found no signal (TOIs 271.01, 641.01, 697.01 and 745.01). A newly detected non-transiting radial velocity candidate is presented orbiting TOI-510 on a 10.0d orbit, with a minimum mass of $4.82^{+1.29}_{-1.26}M_\oplus$, although uncertainties on the system architecture and true orbital period remain. Combining the NCORES sample with archival known planets we investigate the distribution of planet masses and compositions around and below the radius gap, finding that the population of planets below the gap is consistent with a rocky composition and ranges up to a sharp cut-off at $10M_\oplus$. We compare the observed distribution to models of pebble- and planetesimal-driven formation and evolution, finding good broad agreement with both models while highlighting interesting areas of potential discrepancy. Increased numbers of precisely measured planet masses in this parameter space are required to distinguish between pebble and planetesimal accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 In this letter we argue that the CPL parameterisation for the dark energy equation of state is biased towards preferring such model over the constant $w$ while the latter bounds are still compatible with LCDM. For that we compare constraints on the EoS parameters $w_0$ and early time type $w_a$ (CPL) against those with a late time parameterisation on $w_a$ (LZ) and the constant $w$ model, using CMB, Supernovae and BAO from DESI datasets. We found, the same as was the case with CPL model, preference for dynamical dark energy within the LZ model, but for values almost symmetrically distributed with respect to their LCDM limits. This is due to the fact that the presence of $w_0$ allows to recast each parametrisation into making it compensate the preference for $w\sim -1$ in the opposite direction. To further test our hypothesis, we fixed $w_0$ to -1 and followed a minimal approach by considering models that deviates by one free parameter, or we extend to more general models that either group both late and early effects, or allow the presence of two dark energy fluid alike and constant alike component. We found that all the variants, except the original CPL are still compatible with LCDM, with likelihoods peaking close to $w_0 = -1$, $w_a = 0$, or 0.68 for $\Omega_{\rm CC}$, with the constant $w$ and the late time $w_a$ having the smallest constraints. Although we found that the evidence from CPL is stronger than those for the more minimal cases, however the preference increases further for the more generalized parameterizations, while still staying compatible with LCDM in terms of the significance levels. We conclude that considering CPL model is not sufficient to test deviation from the standard model and that it is necessary to conduct further minimal or more general approaches to better understand the outcomes from model testing and inference methods.(abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 This study is aimed at identifying possible low-mass and sub-stellar companions to stars with well-determined metallicities. We investigate the multiplicity of metal-poor stars along with its impact on formation processes in the conditions of the early universe. Our goal is to look for wide common proper motion companions to metal-poor stars and study the binarity frequency at low metallicity with astrometry from large-scale catalogues (Gaia, VHS, and WISE). We used the stellar parameter determination from the latest release of Gaia to identify metal-poor stars over the entire sky. We combined the Gaia sample with other public catalogues and spectroscopic determinations for a given subsample to refine the stellar metallicities. We also considered other public catalogues of metal-poor stars to look for co-moving companions. We obtained our own high-resolution images of a subsample with the lucky imaging technique. We found a few bona fide co-moving systems among a sample of 610 metal-poor stars with metallicities below -1.5 dex in the full sky. We inferred a multiplicity rate below 3%, with 3sigma completeness for projected separations larger than 8 au, after taking into account incompleteness and any other limiting factors of our search. At closer separations, we found a minimum binary fraction of 20% that appears to be relatively independent of metallicity. We conclude that the multiplicity fraction of solar-type stars is relatively independent of metallicity for close-in companions with projected separations below ~8 au. Between 8 and 10000 au, the binary fraction of metal-poor stars drops significantly to a few percent and is significantly lower than the multiplicity derived for the solar-metallicity case. We interpret these similarities and differences as being due to the chemistry at work in molecular clouds as well as disruption effects attributed to the old age of subdwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The MINCE (Measuring at Intermediate Metallicity Neutron-Capture Elements) project aims to provide high quality neutron-capture abundances measurements in several hundred stars at intermediate metallicity,-2.5 < [Fe/H] < -1.5. This project will shed light on the origin of the neutron-capture elements and the chemical enrichment of the Milky Way. Aims. The goal of this work is to chemically characterize the second sample of the MINCE project and compare the abundances with the galactic chemical evolution model at our disposal. Methods. We performed a standard abundance analysis based on 1D LTE model atmospheres on high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise-ratio UVES spectra. Results. We provide the kinematic classification (i.e., thin disk, thick disk, thin-to-thick disk, halo, Gaia Sausage Enceladus, Sequoia) of 99 stars and the atmospheric parameters for almost all stars. We derive the abundances for light elements (from Na to Zn) and neutron-capture elements (Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu) in a subsample of 32 stars in the metallicity range -2.5 < Fe/H] < -1.00. In the subsample of 32 stars, we identify 8 active stars exhibiting (inverse) P-Cygni profile and one Li-rich star, CD 28-11039. We find a general agreement between the chemical abundances and the stochastic model computed for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way halo for the elements Mg, Ca, Si, Ti, Sc, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, and Eu . Conclusions. The MINCE project has already significantly increased the number of neutron-capture elements measurements in the intermediate metallicity range. The results from this sample are in perfect agreement with the previous MINCE sample. The good agreement between the chemical abundances and the chemical evolution model of the Galaxy supports the nucleosynthetic processes adopted to describe the origin of the n-capture elements.

 - **Abstract**
 We developed, characterised, and verified an alignment method for the DESHIMA 2.0 instrument, an ultra wide-band spectrometer operating between 200-400 GHz, at the ASTE telescope. Due to the ultra-wide bandwidth of DESHIMA 2.0, we require the alignment to work across the entire spectral range. Moreover, alignment should be possible remotely, as on-site access is impractical. To fulfill these requirements we mounted the warm optics, consisting of a modified Dragonian dual reflector system, on a motor controlled hexapod. Crucial in the alignment procedure is our sky chopper, which allows fast beam switching. Importantly, it has a small entrance and exit aperture coupling to (cold) sky, which creates a measurable signal with respect to the warm cabin environment. By scanning the instrument beam across the entrance aperture of the sky chopper using the hexapod, we found the hexapod configuration that produced the lowest signal on our detectors, implying the beam is coupled fully to cold sky and not the warm cabin. We first characterised the alignment procedure in the laboratory, where we used a vat containing liquid nitrogen as the cold source behind the sky chopper. Then, we applied the alignment procedure to DESHIMA 2.0 at ASTE, using the sky as the cold source. We used observations of Mars to calculate the aperture efficiency. We did not recover the aperture efficiencies up to design values, which we suspect to be due to a raised sidelobe level or error beam pattern. However, we did find that the alignment procedure significantly improved the aperture efficiency compared to previously reported values of the aperture efficiency of DESHIMA at ASTE, which indicates the veracity of the alignment procedure.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel cosmological framework that unifies matter creation dynamics with thermodynamic principles. Starting with a single-component fluid characterized by a constant equation of state parameter, $\omega$, we introduce a generalized second law of thermodynamics by considering the entropy associated with the cosmic horizon. Imposing an adiabatic expansion condition uniquely determines the particle creation rate, $\Gamma$, a feature unprecedented in previous matter creation models. This mechanism yields a cosmology featuring phantom-like expansion while relying solely on a single constituent, which can be either a quintessence-like fluid or a non-exotic, non-relativistic dark matter component. Remarkably, this framework avoids the need for exotic physics while providing a consistent explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe. Our results open new pathways for understanding the interplay between horizon thermodynamics, particle creation, and cosmic evolution, offering fresh insights into the nature of dark energy and its potential thermodynamic origins.

 - **Abstract**
 To reveal the origin of the mini-starbursts in the Milky Way, we carried out large-scale CO observations toward the RCW 106 giant molecular cloud (GMC) complex using the NANTEN2 4-m radio telescope operated by Nagoya University. We also analyzed the Mopra Southern Galactic plane CO survey and Herschel infrared continuum archival data. The RCW 106 GMC complex contains the radial velocity components of $-68$ km s$^{-1}$ and $-50$ km s$^{-1}$ reported by Nguyen et al. (2015). Focusing on the RCW 106 East and West region with the massive star formation having the bright infrared dust emission, we found that these regions have three different velocity components with $\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$ differences. The two out of three velocity components show morphological correspondence with the infrared cold dust emission and connect with the bridge feature on a position-velocity diagram. Therefore, two molecular clouds (MCs) with $\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$ differences are likely to be physically associated with massive star-forming regions in the GMC complex. Based on these observational results, we argue that mini-starbursts and massive star/cluster formation in the RCW 106 GMC complex are induced by supersonic cloud-cloud collisions in an agglomerate of molecular gas on the Scutum-Centurus arm.

 - **Abstract**
 Light Primordial Black Holes (LPBHs) with masses in the range $10$ g $\leq M_{\rm BH} \leq 10^9$ g, although they evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, can play a significant role in the production of both Dark Matter and Dark Radiation. In particular, LPBHs can evaporate into light axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) with masses $m_a \lesssim$ MeV, contributing to the effective number of neutrino species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Additionally, heavy scalar particles known as moduli, predicted by String Theory, can be produced both via Hawking evaporation and through amplification by a mechanism called Superradiance Instability in the case of spinning PBHs. These moduli can subsequently decay into ALPs, further amplifying their abundance. In this work, we calculate the number density of ALPs in the presence of moduli enhanced by Superradiance for Kerr PBHs. Using current limits on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ from Planck satellite observations, we derive updated constraints on this scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 We present two transit observations of the $\sim$520K, 1.85R$_\oplus$, 4.0M$_\oplus$ super-Earth TOI-776b with JWST NIRSpec/G395H, resulting in a 2.8-5.2$\mu$m transmission spectrum. Producing reductions using the ExoTiC-JEDI and Eureka! pipelines, we obtain a median transit depth precision of 34ppm for both visits and both reductions in spectroscopic channels 30 pixels wide ($\sim$0.02$\mu$m). We find that our independent reductions produce consistent transmission spectra, however, each visit shows differing overall structure. For both reductions, a flat line is preferred for Visit 1 while a flat line with an offset between the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors is preferred for Visit 2; however, we are able to correct for this offset during our modeling analysis following methods outlined in previous literature. Using picaso forward models, we can rule out metallicities up to at least 100$\times$ solar with an opaque pressure of 10$^{-3}$ bar to $\geq$3$\sigma$ in all cases, however, the exact lower limit varies between the visits, with Visit 1 ruling out $\lesssim$100$\times$ solar while the lower limits for Visit 2 extend beyond $\sim$350$\times$ solar. Our results add to the growing list of super-Earth atmospheric constraints by JWST, which provide critical insight into the diversity and challenges of characterizing terrestrial planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes may accrete gas with angular momentum vectors misaligned with the black hole spin axis. The resulting accretion disks are subject to Lense-Thirring precession, and hence torque. Analytical calculations and simulations show that Lense-Thirring precession will warp, and, for large misalignments, fracture the disk. In GRMHD simulations, the warping or breaking occurs at $\lesssim10r_s$, where $r_s$ is the Schwarzschild radius. Considering that accretion disk spectra in the soft state of stellar-mass black holes are generally well modeled as multicolor blackbodies, the question arises as to how consistent warped and broken disks are with observations. Here, we analytically calculate thermal spectra of warped and broken disks with a warp or break radius at $10r_s$ for various disk inclinations. Due to self-irradiation and the projected area of the inclined disk regions, the spectra of inclined disks significantly deviate from multicolor blackbodies and do not follow the multicolor blackbody relation $\nu L_\nu\propto\nu^{\gamma}=\nu^{4/3}$ at low frequencies $\nu$. The power-law indices at low frequencies of the inclined disks vary with viewing angle; when viewed face-on, they vary between $\gamma\approx0.91-1.26$ for the warped disks and $\gamma\approx1.37-1.54$ for the broken disks depending on the inclination angle. The differences decrease when moving the location of the disk warp and break to larger radii; for inclined disks to emit as multicolor blackbodies, they must warp or break at radii $\geq50r_s$. Our results imply that accretion disks around black holes in the soft state warp or break at larger radii than suggested in GRHMD simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 In the context of upcoming large-scale surveys like Euclid, the necessity for the automation of strong lens detection is essential. While existing machine learning pipelines heavily rely on the classification probability (P), this study intends to address the importance of integrating additional metrics, such as Information Content (IC) and the number of pixels above the segmentation threshold, to alleviate the false positive rate in unbalanced data-sets. In this work, we introduce a segmentation algorithm (U-Net) as a supplementary step in the established strong gravitational lens identification pipeline (Denselens), which primarily utilizes P$_{\rm mean}$ and IC$_{\rm mean}$ parameters for the detection and ranking. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of segmentation enables significant reduction of false positives by approximately 25 per cent in the final sample extracted from DenseLens, without compromising the identification of strong lenses. The main objective of this study is to automate the strong lens detection process by integrating these three metrics. To achieve this, a decision tree-based selection process is introduced, applied to the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) data. This process involves rank-ordering based on classification scores, filtering based on Information Content, and segmentation score. Additionally, the study presents 14 newly discovered strong lensing candidates identified by the U-Denselens network using the KiDS DR4 data.

 - **Abstract**
 We study linear scalar perturbations in single-field models of inflation featuring a non-attractor phase. These models lead to a peak in the curvature power spectrum that may result in the formation of primordial black holes. We develop a transfer-matrix formalism, analogous to the S-matrix program in quantum-field theory, that maps perturbations throughout the transitory phase. At scales smaller than the peak, the power spectrum features damped oscillations, and the duration of the transition sets the scale at which power-law damping switches to exponential damping. At scales larger than the peak, we demonstrate that a dip appears in the power spectrum if and only if the inflaton's velocity does not flip sign. We show that the amplitude at the dip always scales as the inverse square-rooted amplitude of the peak, and comment on the physical consequences of this universal relationship. We also test the robustness of our results with a few toy models and interpret them with an intuitive mechanical analogy.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive star formation involves significant ionization in the innermost regions near the central object, such as gravitationally trapped H II regions, jets, ionized disks, or winds. Resolved observations of the associated continuum and recombination line emission are crucial for guiding theory. The next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) will enable unprecedented observations of thermal emission with 1 mas resolution, providing a new perspective on massive star formation at scales down to a few astronomical units at kiloparsec distances. This work presents synthetic interferometric ngVLA observations of the free-free continuum (93-GHz band), $\mathrm{H41\alpha}$, and $\mathrm{H38\alpha}$ recombination lines from ionized jets and disks around massive protostars. Using the sf3dmodels Python package, we generate gas distributions based on analytical models, which are then processed through the RADMC-3D radiative transfer code. Our results indicate that the ngVLA can easily resolve, both spatially and spectrally, the ionized jet from a 15 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ protostar at 700 pc, distinguishing between collimated jets and wide-angle winds, and resolving their launching radii, widths, and any substructure down to a few astronomical units. Detailed studies of radio jets launched by massive protostars will be feasible up to distances of $\sim 2$ kpc. Furthermore, ngVLA will be able to study in detail the ionized disks around massive ($> 10~\mathrm{M_\odot}$) protostars up to distances from 4 to 12 kpc, resolving their kinematics and enabling the measurement of their central masses across the Galaxy. These observations can be conducted with on-source integrations of only a few hours.
