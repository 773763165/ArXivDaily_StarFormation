#### Calibrating angular momentum transport in intermediate-mass stars from  gravity-mode asteroseismology

 - **Abstract**
 The physical mechanisms driving the transport of angular momentum in stars are not fully understood, as current models cannot explain the observed stellar rotation profiles across all stages of evolution. By making use of pulsating F-type dwarfs, this work aims at (i) observationally calibrating the efficiency of angular momentum transport, assuming a constant uniform viscosity, and (ii) testing how well state-of-the-art rotating stellar models with angular momentum (AM) transport by rotationally-induced processes can explain observed rotation profiles. In both cases, the aim is to simultaneously reproduce the measured near-core rotation and core-to-surface rotation ratio. Asteroseismic modelling is applied to a sample of seven slowly rotating pulsators, to derive (core) masses and ages from their gravity-mode oscillations. This work focuses on the main sequence, using models that start with an initial uniform rotation frequency at the start of core-hydrogen burning that is a free parameter. Two treatments of AM transport are considered: (i) a constant uniform viscosity, and (ii) rotationally-induced processes. Next, the initial rotation frequency of each star is derived from the observed present-day near-core rotation frequency for both treatments. To explain the near-core rotation rate at the inferred age, initial rotation frequencies at the zero-age main sequence need to be below 10 percent of the initial critical break-up frequency. A diffusive approximation of angular momentum transport can in general explain the observed rotation profiles of the six slowly-rotating F-type dwarfs, for average values of the viscosity between 2x10^5 and 5x10^7 cm^2/s or when the viscosity is computed from rotationally-induced mechanisms. Yet, for three stars in the sample, the core-to-surface rotation fraction from rotationally-induced mechanisms is predicted to be higher than observed.

 - **Abstract**
 The motion of S2, one of the stars closest to the Galactic Centre, has been measured accurately and used to study the compact object at the centre of the Milky Way. It is commonly accepted that this object is a supermassive black hole but the nature of its environment is open to discussion. Here, we investigate the possibility that dark matter in the form of an ultralight scalar field ``cloud'' clusters around Sgr~A*. We use the available data for S2 to perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis and find the best-fit estimates for a scalar cloud structure. Our results show no substantial evidence for such structures. When the cloud size is of the order of the size of the orbit of S2, we are able to constrain its mass to be smaller than $0.1\%$ of the central mass, setting a strong bound on the presence of new fields in the galactic centre.

 - **Abstract**
 Efforts to understand the origin and growth of massive black holes observed in the early Universe have spurred a strong interest in the evolution and fate of rapidly-accreting primordial (metal-free) stars. Here, we investigate the evolution of such Population III stars under variable accretion rates, focusing on the thermal response and stellar structure, the impact of the luminosity wave encountered early in the pre-main sequence phase, and the influence of accretion on their subsequent evolution. We employ the Geneva stellar evolution code and simulate ten models with varying accretion histories, covering a final mass range from 491 M$_{\odot}$ to 6127 M$_{\odot}$. Our findings indicate that the critical accretion rate delineating the red and blue supergiant regimes during the pre-main sequence evolution is approximately $2.5\times10^{-2} $M$_{\odot}$/yr. Once core hydrogen burning commences, the value of this critical accretion rate drops to $7.0\times10^{-3}$M$_{\odot}$/yr. Moreover, we also confirm that the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale in the outer surface layers is the more relevant timescale for determining the transition between red and blue phases. Regarding the luminosity wave, we find that it affects only the early pre-main sequence phase of evolution and does not directly influence the transition between red and blue phases, which primarily depends on the accretion rate. Finally, we demonstrate that variable accretion rates significantly impact the lifetimes, surface enrichment, final mass and time spent in the red phase. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the intricate evolutionary patterns of Population III stars subjected to variable accretion rates.
#### Galactic Diffuse Neutrino Emission from Sources beyond the Discovery  Horizon

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has recently reported strong evidence for neutrino emission from the Galactic plane. The signal is consistent with model predictions of diffuse emission from cosmic ray propagation in the interstellar medium. However, due to IceCube's limited potential of identifying individual neutrino sources, it is also feasible that unresolved Galactic sources could contribute to the observation. We investigate the contribution of this quasi-diffuse emission and show that the observed Galactic diffuse flux at 100~TeV could be dominated by hard emission of unresolved sources. Particularly interesting candidate sources are young massive stellar clusters that have been considered as cosmic-ray PeVatrons. We examine whether this hypothesis can be tested by the upcoming KM3NeT detector or the planned future facility IceCube-Gen2 with about five times the sensitivity of IceCube.

 - **Abstract**
 V838 Mon is a stellar merger remnant that erupted in 2002 in a luminous red novae event. Although it is well studied in the optical, near infrared and submillimeter regimes, its structure in the mid-infrared wavelengths remains elusive. We observed V838 Mon with the MATISSE (LMN bands) and GRAVITY (K band) instruments at the VLTI and also the MIRCX/MYSTIC (HK bands) instruments at the CHARA array. We geometrically modelled the squared visibilities and the closure phases in each of the bands to obtain constraints on physical parameters. Furthermore, we constructed high resolution images of V838 Mon in the HK bands, using the MIRA and SQUEEZE algorithms to study the immediate surroundings of the star. Lastly, we also modelled the spectral features seen in the K and M bands at various temperatures. The image reconstructions show a bipolar structure that surrounds the central star in the post merger remnant. In the K band, the super resolved images show an extended structure (uniform disk diameter $\sim 1.94$ mas) with a clumpy morphology that is aligned along a north-west position angle (PA) of $-40^\circ$. Whereas in the H band, the extended structure (uniform disk diameter $\sim 1.18$ mas) lies roughly along the same PA. However, the northern lobe is slightly misaligned with respect to the southern lobe, which results in the closure phase deviations. The VLTI and CHARA imaging results show that V838 Mon is surrounded by features that resemble jets that are intrinsically asymmetric. This is also confirmed by the closure phase modelling. Further observations with VLTI can help to determine whether this structure shows any variation over time, and also if such bipolar structures are commonly formed in other stellar merger remnants.
#### Deep Search for Glycine Conformers in Barnard 5

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most fundamental hypotheses in astrochemistry and astrobiology states that crucial biotic molecules like glycine (NH$_2$CH$_2$COOH) found in meteorites and comets are inherited from early phases of star formation. Most observational searches for glycine in the interstellar medium have focused on warm, high-mass molecular cloud sources. However, recent studies suggest that it might be appropriate to shift the observational focus to cold, low-mass sources. We aim to detect glycine towards the so-called methanol hotspot in the Barnard 5 dark cloud. The hotspot is a cold source ($T_\mathrm{gas}\approx 7.5$ K) with yet high abundances of complex organic molecules (COMs) and water in the gas phase. We carried out deep, pointed observations with the Onsala 20m telescope, targeting several transitions of glycine conformers I and II (Gly-I and Gly-II) in the frequency range $70.2$-$77.9$ GHz. No glycine lines are detected towards the targeted position, but we use a line stacking procedure to derive sensitive abundance upper limits w.r.t. H$_2$ for Gly-I and Gly-II, i.e. $\leq(2$-$5)\times10^{-10}$ and $\leq(0.7$-$3)\times10^{-11}$, respectively. The obtained Gly-II upper limits are the most stringent for a cold source, while the Gly-I upper limits are mostly on the same order as previously measured limits. The measured abundances w.r.t. H$_2$ of other COMs at the B5 methanol hotspot range from $2\times10^{-10}$ (acetaldehyde) to $2\times10^{-8}$ (methanol). Hence, based on a total glycine upper limit of $(2$-$5)\times10^{-10}$, we cannot rule out that glycine is present but undetected.
