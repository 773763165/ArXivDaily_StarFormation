          Striving towards robust phase diversity on-sky: Implementing LIFT for VLT/MUSE-NFM

 - **Abstract**
 The recent IRLOS upgrade for VLT/MUSE narrow field mode (NFM) introduced a full-pupil mode to enhance sensitivity and sky coverage. This involved replacing the 2x2 Shack-Hartmann sensor with a single lens for full-aperture photon collection, which also enabled the engagement of the linearized focal-plane technique (LIFT) wavefront sensor instead. However, initial on-sky LIFT experiments have highlighted a complex point spread function (PSF) structure due to strong and polychromatic non-common path aberrations (NCPAs), complicating the accurate retrieval of tip-tilt and focus using LIFT. This study aims to conduct the first on-sky validation of LIFT on VLT/UT4, outline challenges encountered during the tests, and propose solutions for increasing the robustness of LIFT in on-sky operations. We developed a two-stage approach to focal-plane wavefront sensing, where tip-tilt and focus retrieval done with LIFT is preceded by the NCPA calibration step. The resulting NCPA estimate is subsequently used by LIFT. To perform the calibration, we proposed a method capable of retrieving the information about NCPAs directly from on-sky focal-plane PSFs. We verified the efficacy of this approach in simulated and on-sky tests. Our results demonstrate that adopting the two-stage approach has led to a significant improvement in the accuracy of the defocus estimation performed by LIFT, even under challenging low-flux conditions. The efficacy of LIFT as a slow and truth focus sensor in practical scenarios has been demonstrated. However, integrating NCPA calibration with LIFT is essential to verifying its practical application in the real system. Additionally, the proposed calibration step can serve as an independent and minimally invasive approach to evaluate NCPA on-sky.

          Evolution mapping II: describing statistics of the non-linear cosmic velocity field

 - **Abstract**
 We extend the evolution mapping approach, originally proposed by Sanchez (2022) to describe non-linear matter density fluctuations, to statistics of the cosmic velocity field. This framework classifies cosmological parameters into shape parameters, which determine the shape of the linear matter power spectrum, $P_L(k, z)$, and evolution parameters, which control its amplitude at any given redshift. Evolution mapping leverages the fact that density fluctuations in cosmologies with identical shape parameters but different evolution parameters exhibit remarkably similar non-linear evolutions when expressed as a function of the clustering amplitude. We use a suite of N-body simulations sharing identical shape parameters but spanning a wide range of evolution parameters. Using an efficient method for estimating the volume-weighted velocity field based on the Voronoi tesselation of the simulation particles, we study the non-linear evolution of the power spectra of the velocity divergence, $P_{\theta\theta}(k)$, and its cross-power spectrum with the density field, $P_{\delta\theta}(k)$. By analysing snapshots at redshifts where the linear matter perturbations have the same amplitude, we demonstrate that evolution mapping accurately applies to $P_{\theta\theta}(k)$ and $P_{\delta\theta}(k)$. Deviations at small scales can be modelled in terms of differences in the suppression factor, $g(a) = D(a)/a$, akin to those observed for the density field. Evolution mapping simplifies the description of the cosmological dependence of non-linear density and velocity statistics, streamlining the sampling of large cosmological parameter spaces for the analysis of cosmological observables.

 - **Abstract**
 Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for precision tests of cosmology. As the expected deflection angles are small, predictions based on non-linear N-body simulations are commonly computed with the Born approximation. Here we examine this assumption using ${\small DORIAN}$, a newly developed full-sky ray-tracing scheme applied to high-resolution mass-shell outputs of the two largest simulations in the MillenniumTNG suite, each with a 3000 Mpc box containing almost 1.1 trillion cold dark matter particles in addition to 16.7 billion particles representing massive neutrinos. We examine simple two-point statistics like the angular power spectrum of the convergence field, as well as statistics sensitive to higher order correlations such as peak and minimum statistics, void statistics, and Minkowski functionals of the convergence maps. Overall, we find only small differences between the Born approximation and a full ray-tracing treatment. While these are negligibly small at power-spectrum level, some higher order statistics show more sizable effects; ray-tracing is necessary to achieve percent level precision. At the resolution reached here, full-sky maps with 0.8 billion pixels and an angular resolution of 0.43 arcmin, we find that interpolation accuracy can introduce appreciable errors in ray-tracing results. We therefore implemented an interpolation method based on nonuniform fast Fourier transforms (NUFFT) along with more traditional methods. Bilinear interpolation introduces significant smoothing, while nearest grid point sampling agrees well with NUFFT, at least for our fiducial source redshift, $z_s=1.0$, and for the 1 arcmin smoothing we use for higher-order statistics.

          Buoyancy torques prevent low-mass planets from stalling in low-turbulence radiative disks

 - **Abstract**
 Low-mass planets migrating inwards in laminar protoplanetary disks (PPDs) experience a dynamical corotation torque, which is expected to slow down migration to a stall. However, baroclinic effects can reduce or even reverse this effect, leading to rapid inward migration. In the radiatively inefficient inner disk, one such mechanism is the buoyancy response of the disk to an embedded planet. Recent work has suggested that radiative cooling can quench this response, but for parameters that are not necessarily representative of the inner regions of PPDs. We perform global three dimensional inviscid radiation hydrodynamics simulations of planet-disk interaction to investigate the effect of radiative cooling on the buoyancy-driven torque in a more realistic disk model. We find that the buoyancy response exerts a negative dynamical corotation torque -- albeit partially damped due to radiative cooling -- resulting in sustained, rapid inward migration. Models that adopt a local cooling prescription significantly overestimate the impact of the buoyancy response, highlighting the importance of a realistic treatment of radiation transport that includes radiative diffusion. Our results suggest that low-mass planets should migrate inwards faster than has been previously expected in radiative disks, with implications for the formation and orbital distribution of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes at intermediate distances from their host stars, unless additional physical processes that can slow down migration are considered.

 - **Abstract**
 Warm Jupiters are ideal laboratories for testing the limitations of current tools for atmospheric studies. The cross-correlation technique is a commonly used method to investigate the atmospheres of close-in planets, leveraging their large orbital velocities to separate the spectrum of the planet from that of the star. Warm Jupiter atmospheres predominantly consist of molecular species, notably water, methane and carbon monoxide, often accompanied by clouds and hazes muting their atmospheric features. In this study, we investigate the atmospheres of six warm Jupiters K2-139 b, K2-329 b, TOI- 3362 b, WASP-130 b, WASP-106 b, and TOI-677 b to search for water absorption using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, reporting non-detections for all targets. These non-detections are partially attributed to planets having in-transit radial velocity changes that are typically too small to distinguish between the different components (star, planet, Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and telluric contamination), as well as the relatively weak planetary absorption lines as compared to the S/N of the spectra. We simulate observations for the upcoming high-resolution spectrograph ANDES at the Extremely Large Telescope for the two favourable planets on eccentric orbits, TOI-3362b and TOI-677 b, searching for water, carbon monoxide, and methane. We predict a significant detection of water and CO, if ANDES indeed covers the K-band, in the atmospheres of TOI-677 b and a tentative detection of water in the atmosphere of TOI-3362b. This suggests that planets on highly eccentric orbits with favourable orbital configurations present a unique opportunity to access cooler atmospheres.

          The verification of periodicity with the use of recurrent neural networks

 - **Abstract**
 The ability to automatically and robustly self-verify periodicity present in time-series astronomical data is becoming more important as data sets rapidly increase in size. The age of large astronomical surveys has rendered manual inspection of time-series data less practical. Previous efforts in generating a false alarm probability to verify the periodicity of stars have been aimed towards the analysis of a constructed periodogram. However, these methods feature correlations with features that do not pertain to periodicity, such as light curve shape, slow trends and stochastic variability. The common assumption that photometric errors are Gaussian and well determined is also a limitation of analytic methods. We present a novel machine learning based technique which directly analyses the phase folded light curve for its false alarm probability. We show that the results of this method are largely insensitive to the shape of the light curve, and we establish minimum values for the number of data points and the amplitude to noise ratio.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous research suggests that impacts between planetary embryos and planetesimals during the late stages of planet formation can often determine the percentages of core and mantle material that compose the newly formed planets in a system. Previous studies have attempted to include the composition-changing effects of these collisions in N-body simulations of planet formation, often as post-processing codes. In this paper, we present the Differentiated Body Composition Tracker, a new post-processing tool that uses collisional data collected from the N-body integrator REBOUND to determine the amount of core and mantle material that is transferred between colliding objects and the resulting fragments during an impact. We demonstrate how this code works using the data from 50 REBOUND simulations of planet formation and explore how the parameters in the code affect the core mass fractions of the remaining objects from these simulations. We then investigate how non-uniform distributions of core material across an initial disc affect the final core mass fractions of planets. Under ideal conditions, we find that a combination of giant impacts and planetary embryos enriched in core material could create some of the iron-rich planets that have been discovered.

 - **Abstract**
 The Atacama Large Aperture Submm Telescope (AtLAST) is a concept for a novel 50-meter class single-dish telescope operating at sub-millimeter and millimeter wavelengths (30-950 GHz). The telescope will provide an unprecedentedly wide field of view (FoV) of 1-2 degree diameter with a large receiver cabin housing six major instruments in Nasmyth and Cassegrain positions. The high observing frequencies, combined with the scanning operation movements with up to 3 deg/second, place high demands on the accuracy and stability of the optical and structural components. The design features the introduction of a rocking chair type mount with an iso-statically decoupled main reflector backup structure and an active main reflector surface with a high precision metrology system. The planned site location is in the Chilean Atacama Desert at approximately 5050 meters above sea level, near Llano de Chajnantor. This paper gives an overview of the optical, structural, and mechanical design concepts. It explains the flow-down from key science requirements to technical design decisions as well as showing design analogies from other existing large radio, (sub-)mm, and optical telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on an observation of the difference between northern and southern skies of the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray energy spectrum with a significance of ${\sim}8\sigma$. We use measurements from the two largest experiments$\unicode{x2014}$the Telescope Array observing the northern hemisphere and the Pierre Auger Observatory viewing the southern hemisphere. Since the comparison of two measurements from different observatories introduces the issue of possible systematic differences between detectors and analyses, we validate the methodology of the comparison by examining the region of the sky where the apertures of the two observatories overlap. Although the spectra differ in this region, we find that there is only a $1.8\sigma$ difference between the spectrum measurements when anisotropic regions are removed and a fiducial cut in the aperture is applied.

          Proton-air interactions at ultra-high energies in muon-depleted air showers with different depths

 - **Abstract**
 The hardness of the energy spectrum of neutral pions produced in proton-air interactions at ultra-high energies, above $10^{18}$ eV, is constrained by the steepness of the shower-to-shower distribution of the number of muons in muon-depleted extensive air showers. In this work, we find that this steepness, quantified by the parameter $\Lambda_\mu$, evolves with the depth of the shower maximum, $X_{\max}$, assuming a universal value for shallow showers and an enhanced dependence on the high-energy hadronic interaction model for deep showers. We show that Xmax probes the so-called hadronic activity of the first interaction, thus allowing direct access to the energy spectrum of neutral pions in different regions of the kinematic phase space of the first interaction. We verify that the unbiased measurement of $\Lambda_\mu$ is possible for realistic mass composition expectations. Finally, we infer that the statistical precision in $\Lambda_\mu$ required to distinguish between hadronic interaction models can be achieved in current extensive air shower detectors, given their resolution and exposure.

 - **Abstract**
 For a sample of 18 recycled millisecond pulsars (rMSPs) that are in double neutron star (DNS) systems, and 42 rMSPs that are not in DNS pairs, we analyze the distributions of the characteristic age, $\tau_c$, and the time until merger of the double systems, $\tau_{\rm gw}$. Based on the $\tau_c$ distribution of non-DNS rMSPs, we argue that $\tau_c$ is a reasonable estimator of true pulsar age and that rMSPs are active as pulsars for a long (~Hubble) time. Among the DNSs there is an excess of young systems (small $\tau_c$) with short life expectancy (small $\tau_{\rm gw}$) compared to model expectations for the distributions of $\tau_c$ and $\tau_{\rm gw}$ if, at birth, DNSs have a delay-time distribution (DTD) of the form $t^{-1}$ (expected generically for close binaries), or for that matter, from expectations from any single power-law DTD. A two-population DNS model solves the problem: the data are best fit by the combination of a "fast" population with DTD going as $t^{-1.9\pm0.4}$, and a "slow" population of DNSs, with DTD proportional to $t^{-1.1\pm0.15}$. The fast population can be equivalently represented by a DTD with an exponential cutoff beyond t~300 Myr. The fast population completely dominates, by a factor A~10-100, the numbers of DNSs that merge within a Hubble time, and that presumably lead to short gamma-ray bursts and kilonova explosions. With a simple, empirically based, chemical-evolution calculation, we show that the fast/steep kilonova DTD, convolved with the measured star-formation history of the Milky Way's thick-disk population, naturally reproduces the "knee" structure seen in abundance-ratio diagrams of thick-disk stars, for europium and two other r-process elements. As a corollary we show, based again solely on empirical input, that the Milky Way is nearly a "closed box" that has retained at least ~70-90% of the metals produced over the Galaxy's lifetime.

 - **Abstract**
 Trappist-1 hosts 7 planets where period ratios of neighbouring pairs are close to the 8:5, 5:3, 3:2, 3:2, 4:3, and 3:2 ratios in increasing distance from the star. The Laplace angles associated with neighbouring triplets are observed to be librating, proving the resonant nature of the system. This compact, resonant configuration is a manifest sign of disc-driven migration; however, the preferred outcome of such evolution is the establishment of first-order resonances, not the high-order resonances observed in the inner system. Here, we explain the observed orbital configuration in a model that is largely independent on the specific disc migration and orbital circularisation efficiencies. Together with migration, the two key elements of our model are: i) the inner border of the protoplanetary disc receded with time; and ii) the system was initially separated in two sub-systems. Specifically, the inner b, c d and e planets were initially placed in a 3:2 resonance chain and then evolved to the 8:5 -- 5:3 commensurability between planets b, c and d under the effect of the recession of the inner edge of the disc, whereas the outer planets migrated to the inner edge at a later time, establishing the remaining resonances. Our results pivot on the dynamical role of the presently unobservable recession of the inner edge of protoplanetary discs. They also reveal the role of recurring phases of convergent migration followed by resonant repulsion with associated orbital circularisation when resonant chains interact with migration barriers.

 - **Abstract**
 The sensitivity limits of space telescopes are imposed by uncalibrated errors in the point spread function, photon-noise, background light, and detector sensitivity. These are typically calibrated with specialized wavefront sensor hardware and with flat fields obtained on the ground or with calibration sources, but these leave vulnerabilities to residual time-varying or non-common path aberrations and variations in the detector conditions. It is therefore desirable to infer these from science data alone, facing the prohibitively high dimensional problems of phase retrieval and pixel-level calibration. We introduce a new Python package for physical optics simulation, dLux, which uses the machine learning framework JAX to achieve GPU acceleration and automatic differentiation (autodiff), and apply this to simulating astronomical imaging. In this first of a series of papers, we show that gradient descent enabled by autodiff can be used to simultaneously perform phase retrieval and calibration of detector sensitivity, scaling efficiently to inferring millions of parameters. This new framework enables high dimensional optimization and inference in data analysis and hardware design in astronomy and beyond, which we explore in subsequent papers in this series.

 - **Abstract**
 The design of astronomical hardware operating at the diffraction limit requires optimization of physical optical simulations of the instrument with respect to desired figures of merit, such as throughput or astrometric accuracy. These systems can be high dimensional, with highly nonlinear relationships between outputs and the adjustable parameters of the hardware. In this series of papers we present and apply dLux, an open-source end-to-end differentiable optical modelling framework. Automatic differentiation enables not just efficient high-dimensional optimization of astronomical hardware designs, but also Bayesian experimental design directly targeting the precision of experimental outcomes. Automatic second derivatives enable the exact and numerically stable calculation of parameter covariance forecasts, and higher derivatives of these enable direct optimization of these forecasts. We validate this method against analytic theory and illustrate its utility in evaluating the astrometric precision of a parametrized telescope model, and the design of a diffractive pupil to achieve optimal astrometric performance for exoplanet searches. The source code and tutorial software are open source and publicly available, targeting researchers who may wish to harness dLux for their own optical simulation problems.

          Constraints on the formation history and composition of Kepler planets from their distribution of orbital period ratios

 - **Abstract**
 The Kepler high-precision planetary sample has revealed a radius valley, separating compact super-Earths from sub-Neptunes with lower density. Super-Earths are generally assumed to be rocky planets that were probably born in-situ, while the composition and origin of sub-Neptunes remains debated. To provide more constraints on the formation history and composition, based on the planetary sample of Kepler multiple planet systems, we derive the distributions of orbital period ratios of sub-Neptune and super-Earth planet pairs and calculate the normalised fraction of near-first-order mean motion resonances. Using synthetic planetary systems generated by the Generation III Bern Model, we also obtain theoretical predictions of period ratio distributions of planet pairs of different compositions and origins. We find that actual Kepler sub-Neptune pairs show a normalised fraction smaller (larger) than the model predictions for water-rich (water-poor) pairs with confidence levels of about two sigma. The derived normalised fraction of actual Kepler Super-Earth pairs is generally consistent with that of water-poor model planet pairs but significantly smaller than that of synthetic water-rich planet pairs. Based on the distributions of orbital period ratios, we conclude that orbital migration has been more important for sub-Neptunes than for super-Earths, suggesting a partial ex situ formation of the former and an origin of the radius valley caused in part by distinct formation pathways. However, the model comparisons also show that sub-Neptunes in actual Kepler multiple systems are not likely to be all water-rich/ex situ planets but a mixture of the two (in situ/ex situ) pathways. Whereas, Kepler super-Earth planets are predominantly composed by of water-poor planets that were born inside the ice line, likely through a series of giant impacts without large scale migration.

 - **Abstract**
 As TeV gamma-ray astronomy progresses into the era of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), instantaneously following up on gamma-ray transients is becoming more important than ever. To this end, a worldwide network of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes has been proposed. Australia is ideally suited to provide coverage of part of the Southern Hemisphere sky inaccessible to H.E.S.S. in Namibia and the upcoming CTA-South in Chile. This study assesses the sources detectable by a small, transient-focused array in Australia based on CTA telescope designs. The TeV emission of extragalactic sources (including the majority of gamma-ray transients) can suffer significant absorption by the extragalactic background light. As such, we explored the improvements possible by implementing stereoscopic and topological triggers, as well as lowered image cleaning thresholds, to access lower energies. We modelled flaring gamma-ray sources based on past measurements from the satellite-based gamma-ray telescope Fermi-LAT. We estimate that an array of four Medium-Sized Telescopes (MSTs) would detect $\sim$24 active galactic nucleus flares >5$\sigma$ per year, up to a redshift of $z\approx1.5$. Two MSTs achieved $\sim$80-90% of the detections of four MSTs. The modelled Galactic transients were detectable within the observation time of one night, 11 of the 21 modelled gamma-ray bursts were detectable, as were $\sim$10% of unidentified transients. An array of MST-class telescopes would thus be a valuable complementary telescope array for transient TeV gamma-ray astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar halo of the Milky Way is built up, at least in part, from debris from past mergers. Stars from such merger events define substructures in phase-space, for example in the form of streams, which are groups of stars moving on similar trajectories. The nearby Helmi streams discovered more than two decades ago are a well-known example. Using 6D phase-space information from the Gaia space mission, Dodd et al. (2022) have recently reported that the Helmi streams are split into two clumps in angular momentum space. Such substructure can be explained and sustained in time if the dark matter halo of the Milky Way takes a prolate shape in the region probed by the orbits of the stars in the streams. Here, we explore the behaviour of the two clumps identified in the Helmi streams in a Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) framework to test this alternative model of gravity. We perform orbit integrations of Helmi streams member stars in a simplified MOND model of the Milky Way and using the more sophisticated Phantom of RAMSES simulation framework. We find with both approaches that the two Helmi streams clumps do not retain their identity and dissolve after merely 100 Myr. This extremely short timescale would render the detection of two separate clumps as very unlikely in MONDian gravity. The observational constraints provided by the streams, which MOND fails to reproduce in its current formulation, could potentially also be used to test other alternative gravity models.

 - **Abstract**
 W49A is a prominent giant molecular cloud (GMC) that exhibits strong star formation activities, yet its structural and kinematic properties remain uncertain. Our study aims to investigate the large-scale structure and kinematics of W49A, and elucidate the role of filaments and hub-filament systems (HFSs) in its star formation activity. We utilized continuum data from Herschel and the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) as well as the molecular lines 12CO (3-2), 13CO (3-2), and C18O (3-2) to identify filaments and HFS structures within W49A. Further analysis focused on the physical properties, kinematics, and mass transport within these structures. Additionally, recombination line emission from the H I/OH/Recombination (THOR) line survey was employed to trace the central H II region and ionized gas. Our findings reveal that W49A comprises one blue-shifted (B-S) HFS and one red-shifted (R-S) HFS, each with multiple filaments and dense hubs. Notably, significant velocity gradients were detected along these filaments, indicative of material transport toward the hubs. High mass accretion rates along the filaments facilitate the formation of massive stars in the HFSs. Furthermore, the presence of V-shaped structures around clumps in position-velocity diagrams suggests ongoing gravitational collapse and local star formation within the filaments. Our results indicate that W49A consists of one R-S HFS and one B-S HFS, and that the material transport from filaments to the hub promotes the formation of massive stars in the hub. These findings underscore the significance of HFSs in shaping the star formation history of W49A.

 - **Abstract**
 Dense outflowing gas, traced by transitions of molecules with large dipole moment, is important for understanding mass loss and feedback of massive star formation. HCN 3-2 and HCO$^+$ 3-2 are good tracers of dense outflowing molecular gas, which are closely related to active star formation. In this study, we present on-the-fly (OTF) mapping observations of HCN 3-2 and HCO$^+$ 3-2 toward a sample of 33 massive star-forming regions using the 10-m Submillimeter Telescope (SMT). With the spatial distribution of line wings of HCO$^+$ 3-2 and HCN 3-2, outflows are detected in 25 sources, resulting in a detection rate of 76$\%$. The optically thin H$^{13}$CN and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ 3-2 lines are used to identify line wings as outflows and estimate core mass. The mass $M_{out}$, momentum $P_{out}$, kinetic energy $E_{K}$, force $F_{out}$ and mass loss rate $\dot M_{out}$ of outflow and core mass, are obtained for each source. A sublinear tight correlation is found between the mass of dense molecular outflow and core mass, with an index of $\sim$ 0.8 and a correlation coefficient of 0.88.

 We aim to determine the fundamental properties of the $\sim$35 Myr old star TOI-837 and its close-in Saturn-sized planet, and to investigate the system's formation and evolutionary history. We analysed TESS photometry and HARPS spectroscopic data, measured stellar and planetary parameters, and characterised the stellar activity. We performed population synthesis simulations to track the formation history of TOI-837 $b$, and to reconstruct its possible internal structure. We investigated the planetary atmospheric evolution through photo-evaporation, and quantified the prospects for atmospheric characterisation with JWST. TOI-837 $b$ has radius and mass similar to those of Saturn ($r_b$=9.71$^{+0.93}_{-0.60}$ \rearth, $m_b$=116$^{+17}_{-18}$ M$_\odot$, and $\rho_b$=0.68$^{+0.20}_{-0.18}$ gcm$^{-3}$), on a primordial circular orbit. Population synthesis and early migration simulations suggest that the planet could have originated between 2-4 au, and have either a large and massive core, or a smaller Saturn-like core, depending on the opacity of the protoplanetary gas and on the growth rate of the core. We found that photo-evaporation produced negligible effects even at early ages (3-10 Myr). Transmission spectroscopy with JWST is very promising, and expected to provide constraints on atmospheric metallicity, abundance of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$ molecules, and to probe the presence of refractory elements. TOI-837 offers valuable prospects for follow-up observations, which are needed for a thorough characterisation. JWST will help to better constraining the formation and evolution history of the system, and understand whether TOI-837 $b$ is a Saturn-analogue.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of X-ray pulsars (XRPs) performed by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) have made it possible to investigate the intricate details of these objects in a new way, thanks to the added value of X-ray polarimetry. Here we present the results of the IXPE observations of SMC X-1, a member of the small group of XRPs displaying super-orbital variability. SMC X-1 was observed by IXPE three separate times during the high state of its super-orbital period. The observed luminosity in the 2-8 keV energy band of $L=2\times10^{38}$ erg/s makes SMC X-1 the brightest XRP ever observed by IXPE. We detect significant polarization in all three observations, with values of the phase-averaged polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA) of $3.2\pm0.8$% and $97°\pm8°$ for Observation 1, $3.0\pm0.9$% and $90°\pm8°$ for Observation 2, and $5.5\pm1.1$% and $80°\pm6°$ for Observation 3, for the spectro-polarimetric analysis. The observed PD shows an increase over time with decreasing luminosity, while the PA decreases in decrements of 10°. The phase-resolved spectro-polarimetric analysis reveals significant detection of polarization in three out of seven phase bins, with the PD ranging between 2% and 10%, and a corresponding range in the PA from $\sim$70° to $\sim$100°. The pulse-phase resolved PD displays an apparent anti-correlation with the flux. Using the rotating vector model, we obtain constraints on the pulsar's geometrical properties for the individual observations. The position angle of the pulsar displays an evolution over time supporting the idea that we observe changes related to different super-orbital phases. Scattering in the wind of the precessing accretion disk may be responsible for the behavior of the polarimetric properties observed during the high-state of SMC X-1's super-orbital period.

 - **Abstract**
 The long-period O-star binary system HD 168112 and the triple O-star system HD 167971 are well-known sources of non-thermal radio emission that arises from a colliding wind interaction. The wind-wind collisions in these systems should result in phase-dependent X-ray emissions. The presence of a population of relativistic electrons in the wind interaction zone could affect the properties of the X-ray emission and make it deviate from the behaviour expected for adiabatic shocks. We investigate the X-ray emission of these systems with the goals of quantifying the fraction of the X-ray flux arising from wind interactions and determining whether these emissions follow the predictions for adiabatic wind-wind collisions. Six X-ray observations were collected with XMM-Newton. Three observations were scheduled around the most recent periastron passage of HD 168112. Spectra and light curves were analysed and compared with simple predictions of model calculations for X-ray emission from colliding wind systems. The X-ray emission of HD 168112 varies as the inverse of the orbital separation, as expected for an adiabatic wind interaction zone. The relative contribution of intrinsic X-ray emission from wind-embedded shocks varies between 38% at periastron to 81% at apastron. The wind-wind collision zone remains adiabatic even around periastron passage. The X-ray emission of HD 167971 displays variations on the orbital timescale of the inner eclipsing binary. The existing data of this system do not allow us to probe variations on the timescale of the outer orbit. Shock modification due to the action of relativistic electrons does not seem to be efficiently operating in the HD 168112 system. In the existing observations, a significant part of the emission of HD 167971 must arise in the inner eclipsing binary. The origin of this emission is as yet unclear.

 - **Abstract**
 LB-1 is a binary system that has drawn great attention since its discovery in 2019. The nature of the two components of LB-1 is not very clear, which however is suggested very possibly to be a B-type star plus a black hole (BH). In this paper, we first calculate the wind mass-loss rate of the B-type star. We then calculate the mass capture rate by the BH, with which as the initial mass accretion rate, we calculate the truncation radius of the accretion disk and the corresponding emergent spectra of the accretion flow (comprising an inner advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) + an outer truncated accretion disk) within the framework of the disk evaporation model. It is found that the predicted truncation radius of the accretion disk with appropriate model parameters is consistent with observations inferred from the observed broad H$_\alpha$ emission line. The predicted X-ray luminosity is definitely below the estimated upper limits with the sensitivity of Chandra X-ray Observatory of the X-ray luminosity $\sim 2\times 10^{31}$ erg/s. Finally, we argue that if the disk evaporation model indeed reflects the intrinsic physics of the accretion flow, the value of the viscosity parameter $\alpha$ is constrained to be $\alpha \gtrsim 0.05$ (with BH mass being $68M_{\rm \odot}$), or $\alpha \gtrsim 0.003$ (with BH mass being $21M_{\rm \odot}$) to match the observed upper limit of the X-ray luminosity of LB-1.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the question of how generic is the formation of primordial black holes via self-resonant growth of inflaton fluctuations in the post-inflationary, preheating phase. Using analytical and lattice calculations, we find that primordial black hole production is far from being a generic outcome. Also, in most of the parameter space of viable inflationary models, the metric preheating term is subleading to the anharmonic terms and the approximation of a quadratic potential for describing the resonance dynamics is inadequate. Nonetheless, the anharmonicity of the potential cannot be used to rescue the mechanism: The generic outcome of the non-linear evolution of the scalar field in this case is the formation of metastable transients or oscillons, that do not generically collapse into black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 As a relatively young and bright population, and the archetype of standard candles, classical Cepheids make an ideal population to trace non-axisymmetric structure in the young stellar disk to large distances. We use the new distances derived in Paper I based on mid-IR WISE photometry for a selected sample of 2857 dynamically young Cepheids to trace the spiral arms of the Milky Way. The Perseus and Sagittarius-Carina arms are clearly evident in the third and fourth Galactic quadrants, while the Local and Scutum arms are much weaker, with extinction severely limiting our view of the latter, inner-most spiral arm. Pitch angles are derived for each arm over various ranges of galactic azimuth, each covering at least 90° in azimuth. Our method of detecting spiral arms and deriving pitch angles does not rely on pre-assigning sources to specific arms. While spiral structure in the first and second quadrant is not obvious, in part due to extinction effects, it is not inconsistent with that seen in the third and fourth quadrants. In summary, the Cepheids allow us to map spiral structure in the third and fourth Galactic quadrants where there are currently few masers with astrometric parallaxes, thus significantly extending our picture of the Milky Way on large-scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Interferometric imaging is algorithmically and computationally challenging as there is no unique inversion from the measurement data back to the sky maps, and the datasets can be very large. Many imaging methods already exist, but most of them focus either on the accuracy or the computational aspect. Aims: This paper aims to reduce the computational complexity of the Bayesian imaging algorithm resolve, enabling the application of Bayesian imaging for larger datasets. Methods: By combining computational shortcuts of the CLEAN algorithm with the Bayesian imaging algorithm resolve we developed an accurate and fast imaging algorithm which we name fast-resolve. Results: We validate the accuracy of the presented fast-resolve algorithm by comparing it with results from resolve on VLA Cygnus A data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the computational advantages of fast-resolve on a large MeerKAT ESO 137-006 dataset which is computationally out of reach for resolve. Conclusions: The presented algorithm is significantly faster than previous Bayesian imaging algorithms, broadening the applicability of Bayesian interferometric imaging. Specifically for the single channel VLA Cygnus A datasets fast-resolve is about $144$ times faster than resolve. For the MeerKAT dataset with multiple channels the computational speedup of fast-resolve is even larger.

          A formation pathway for terrestrial planets with moderate water content involving atmospheric-volatile recycling

 - **Abstract**
 Of the many recently discovered terrestrial exoplanets, some are expected to harbor moderate water mass fractions of a few percent. The formation pathways that can produce planets with these water mass fractions are not fully understood. Here, we use the code chemcomp, which consists of a semi-analytical 1D protoplanetary disk model harboring a migrating and accreting planet, to model the growth and composition of planets with moderate water mass fractions by pebble accretion in a protoplanetary disk around a TRAPPIST-1 analog star. This star is accompanied by seven terrestrial planets, of which the outer four planets likely contain water mass fractions of between 1\% and 10\%. We adopt a published model that considers the evaporation of pebbles in the planetary envelope, from where recycling flows can transport the volatile vapor back into the disk. We find that with this model, the planetary water content depends on the influx rate of pebbles onto the planet. A decreasing pebble influx with time reduces the envelope temperature and consequently allows the formation of planets with moderate water mass fractions as inferred for the outer TRAPPIST-1 planets for a number of different simulation configurations. This is further evidence that the recycling of vapor is an important component of planet formation needed to explain the vast and diverse population of exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 Modified Growth with CAMB (MGCAMB) is a patch for the Einstein-Boltzmann solver CAMB for cosmological tests of gravity. Until now, MGCAMB was limited to scales well-described by linear perturbation theory. In this work, we extend the framework with a phenomenological model that can capture nonlinear corrections in a broad range of modified gravity theories. The extension employs the publicly available halo model reaction code ReACT, developed for modeling the nonlinear corrections to cosmological observables in extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM model. The nonlinear extension makes it possible to use a wider range of data from large scale structure surveys, without applying a linear scale cut. We demonstrate that, with the 3$\times$2pt Dark Energy Survey data, we achieve a stronger constraint on the linear phenomenological functions $\mu$ and $\Sigma$, after marginalizing over the additional nonlinear parameter $p_1$, compared to the case without the nonlinear extension and using a linear cut. The new version of MGCAMB is now forked with CAMB on GitHub allowing for compatibility with future upgrades.

 - **Abstract**
 The VISTA Variables in the Via Láctea Extended Survey (VVVX) enables exploration of previously uncharted territories within the inner Milky Way (MW), particularly those obscured by stellar crowding and intense extinction. Our objective is to identify and investigate new star clusters to elucidate their intrinsic characteristics. Specifically, we are focused on uncovering new candidate Globular Clusters (GCs) situated at low Galactic latitudes, with the ultimate goal of completing the census of the MW GC system. Leveraging a combination of Near-InfraRed (NIR) data from the VVVX survey and Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), along with optical photometry and precise proper motions (PMs) from the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), we are conducting a systematic characterisation of new GCs. As a result, we report the discovery and characterisation of four new Galactic clusters named FSR 1700, FSR 1415, CWNU 4193, and Teutsch 67, all located within the MW disk. We estimate a wide range of reddening, with values ranging from 0.44 to 0.73 mag for E(J-Ks). The heliocentric distances span from 10.3 to 13.2 kpc. Additionally, we determine their metallicities and ages, finding a range of -0.85 to -0.75 dex for [Fe/H] and ages approximately close to 11 Gyr, respectively. FSR 1415 is an exception, it is an old open cluster with age = 3 Gyr and [Fe/H] = -0.10. Furthermore, we fitted the radial density profiles to derive their structural parameters like tidal radius, core radius, and concentration parameters. In conclusion, based on their positions, kinematics, metallicities, and ages, and comparing our findings with existing literature, we categorise FSR 1700, Teutsch 67 and CWNU 4193 as genuine GC candidates, while FSR 1415 is an old open cluster exhibiting characteristics of a post core-collapse cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the effects of rotation in stellar evolution is key to modelling early-type stars, half of which have equatorial velocities over 100 km/s. The nearby star Altair is an example of such fast-rotating stars, and furthermore, it has the privilege of being modelled by a detailed 2D concordance model that reproduces most of its observables. The aim of this paper is to include new asteroseismic frequencies to improve our knowledge of Altair, especially its age. We processed images of Altair obtained during July 2022 by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite using the halo photometry technique to obtain its light curve over this observation period. By analysing the light curve, we derived a set of 22 new frequencies in the oscillation spectrum of Altair and confirmed 12 previously known frequencies. Compared with model predictions, we could associate ten frequencies with ten axisymmetric modes. This identification is based on the modelled visibility of the modes. Moreover, nine of the modelled frequencies can be adjusted to simultaneously match their corresponding observed frequencies, once the core hydrogen mass fraction of the concordance model is set to $X_{\rm core}/X_{\rm ini}\simeq0.972$, with $X_{\rm ini}=0.739$. Using the combined results of a 1D MESA model computing the pre-main sequence and a 2D time-dependent ESTER model computing the main sequence, we find that this core hydrogen abundance sets the age of Altair to 88$\pm$10 Myrs, which is slightly younger than previous estimates.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of a 100 kpc low-frequency radio tail behind the nearby group galaxy, NGC 2276. The extent of this tail is a factor of ten larger than previously reported from higher-frequency radio and X-ray imaging. The radio morphology of the galaxy disc and tail suggest that the tail was produced via ram-pressure stripping, cementing NGC 2276 as the clearest known example of ram-pressure stripping in a low-mass group. With multi-frequency imaging, we extract radio continuum spectra between ~50 MHz and 1.2 GHz as a function of projected distance along the tail. All of the spectra are well fit by a simple model of spectral ageing due to synchrotron and inverse-Compton losses. From these fits we estimate a velocity of 870 km/s for the stripped plasma across the plane of the sky, and a three-dimensional orbital velocity of 970 km/s for NGC 2276. The orbital speed that we derive is in excellent agreement with the previous estimate from Rasmussen et al., despite it being derived with a completely independent methodology.

 - **Abstract**
 For several years, the metastable helium triplet line has been successfully used as a tracer to probe atmospheric escape in transiting exoplanets. This absorption in the near-infrared (1083.3 nm) can be observed from the ground using high-resolution spectroscopy, providing new constraints on the mass-loss rate and the temperature characterizing the upper atmosphere of close-in exoplanets. The aim of this work is to search for the He triplet signature in 15 transiting exoplanets -- ranging from super-Earths to ultrahot Jupiters -- observed with SPIRou, a high-resolution (R~70 000) near-infrared spectropolarimeter at the CFHT, in order to bring new constraints or to improve existing ones regarding atmospheric escape through a homogeneous study. We developed a full data processing and analysis pipeline to correct for the residual telluric and stellar contributions. We then used two different 1D models based on the Parker-wind equations and nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) radiative transfer to interpret the observational results. We confirm published He triplet detections for HAT-P-11 b, HD 189733 b, and WASP-69 b. We tentatively detect the signature of escaping He in HD 209458 b, GJ 3470 b, and WASP-76 b. We report new constraints on the mass-loss rate and temperature for our three detections and set upper limits for the tentative and nondetections. We notably report improved constraints on the mass-loss rate and temperature of the escaping gas for TOI-1807 b, and report a nondetection for the debated atmospheric escape in GJ 1214 b. We also conducted the first search for the He signature in GJ 486 b since its discovery and report a nondetection of the He triplet. Finally, we studied the impact of important model assumptions on our retrieved parameters, notably the limitations of 1D models and the influence of the H/He ratio on the derived constraints.

 Observations of the cosmic microwave background constrain the abundance of primordial black holes, as these would accrete gas and inject energy into the cosmological medium. We have revisited these constraints, taking into account the local heating and ionisation of the gas around the black holes. While constraints for \textit{naked} black holes are not significantly affected, bounds including dark matter mini-halos are drastically relaxed. This result suggests that previous analysis may have significantly overestimated the role of dark matter mini-halos in boosting the accretion rates.

 - **Abstract**
 As JWST begins to return observations, it is more important than ever that exoplanet climate models can consistently and correctly predict the observability of exoplanets, retrieval of their data, and interpretation of planetary environments from that data. Model intercomparisons play a crucial role in this context, especially now when few data are available to validate model predictions. The CUISINES Working Group of NASA's Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (NExSS) supports a systematic approach to evaluating the performance of exoplanet models, and provides here a framework for conducting community-organized exoplanet Model Intercomparison Projects (exoMIPs). The CUISINES framework adapts Earth climate community practices specifically for the needs of exoplanet researchers, encompassing a range of model types, planetary targets, and parameter space studies. It is intended to help researchers to work collectively, equitably, and openly toward common goals. The CUISINES framework rests on five principles: 1) Define in advance what research question(s) the exoMIP is intended to address. 2) Create an experimental design that maximizes community participation, and advertise it widely. 3) Plan a project timeline that allows all exoMIP members to participate fully. 4) Generate data products from model output for direct comparison to observations. 5) Create a data management plan that is workable in the present and scalable for the future. Within the first years of its existence, CUISINES is already providing logistical support to 10 exoMIPs, and will continue to host annual workshops for further community feedback and presentation of new exoMIP ideas.

 - **Abstract**
 We used the database of $1040$ short-period ($1 \leq P < 200$ days) exoplanets radial-velocity (RV) orbits to study the planetary eccentricity-period (PEP) distribution. We first divided the sample into low- and high-mass exoplanet sub-samples based on the distribution of the (minimum) planetary masses, which displays a clear two-Gaussian distribution, separated at $0.165M_J$. We then selected $216$ orbits, low- and high-mass alike, with eccentricities significantly distinct from circular orbits. The $131$ giant-planet eccentric orbits display a clear upper envelope, which we model quantitatively, rises monotonically from zero eccentricity and reaches an eccentricity of $0.8$ at $P \sim 100$ days. Conversely, the $85$ low-mass planetary orbits display a flat eccentricity distribution between $0.1$ and $0.5$, with almost no dependence on the orbital period. We show that the striking difference between the two PEP distributions is not a result of the detection technique used. The upper envelope of the high-mass planets, also seen in short-period binary stars, is a clear signature of tidal circularization, which probably took place inside the planets, while the small-planet PEP distribution suggests that the circularization was not effective, probably due to dynamical interactions with neighboring planets.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present the design and manufacturing of the two multi-mode antenna arrays of the COSMO experiment and the preliminary beam pattern measurements of their fundamental mode compared with simulations. COSMO is a cryogenic Martin-Puplett Fourier Transform Spectrometer that aims at measuring the isotropic y-type spectral distortion of the Cosmic Microwave Background from Antarctica, by performing differential measurements between the sky and an internal, cryogenic reference blackbody. To reduce the atmospheric contribution, a spinning wedge mirror performs fast sky-dips at varying elevations while fast, low-noise Kinetic Inductance detectors scan the interferogram. Two arrays of antennas couple the radiation to the detectors. Each array consists of nine smooth-walled multi-mode feed-horns, operating in the $120-180$ GHz and $210-300$ GHz range, respectively. The multi-mode propagation helps increase the instrumental sensitivity without employing large focal planes with hundreds of detectors. The two arrays have a step-linear and a linear profile, respectively, and are obtained by superimposing aluminum plates made with CNC milling. The simulated multi-mode beam pattern has a $\sim 20^{\circ} - 26^{\circ}$ FWHM for the low-frequency array and $\sim 16^{\circ}$ FWHM for the high-frequency one. The side lobes are below $-15$ dB. To characterize the antenna response, we measured the beam pattern of the fundamental mode using a Vector Network Analyzer, in far-field conditions inside an anechoic chamber at room temperature. We completed the measurements of the low-frequency array and found a good agreement with the simulations. We also identified a few non-idealities that we attribute to the measuring setup and will further investigate. A comprehensive multi-mode measurement will be feasible at cryogenic temperature once the full receiver is integrated.

          More Likely Than You Think: Inclination-Driving Secular Resonances are Common in Known Exoplanet Systems

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-planet systems face significant challenges to detection. For example, further orbiting planets have reduced signal-to-noise ratio in radial velocity detection methods, and small mutual inclinations between planets can prevent them from all transiting. One mechanism to excite mutual inclination between planets is secular resonance, where the nodal precession frequencies of the planets align such as to greatly increase the efficiency of angular momentum transport between planets. These resonances can significantly misalign planets from one another, hindering detection, and typically can only occur when there are three or more planets in the system. Naively, systems can only be in resonance for particular combinations of planet semimajor axes and masses; however, effects that alter the nodal precession frequencies of the planets, such as the decay of stellar oblateness, can significantly expand the region of parameter space where resonances occur. In this work, we explore known three-planet systems, determine whether they are in (or were in) secular resonance due to evolving stellar oblateness, and demonstrate the implications of resonance on their detectability and stability. We show that about 20% of a sample of three planet transiting systems seem to undergo these resonances early in their lives.

          The Stability of the BAO Linear Point under Modified Gravity

 - **Abstract**
 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) are crucial in cosmological analysis, providing a standard ruler, as well as constraints on dark energy. In General Relativity models, the BAO Linear Point - the midpoint between the dip and the peak in the correlation function - has been shown to be rather robust to evolution and redshift space distortions. We show that this remains true even when the gravity model is not General Relativity, at least for $f(R)$ and DGP gravity models which have the same expansion history as the standard $\Lambda$CDM. For the Linear Point to be able to distinguish between modified gravity (MG) and $\Lambda$CDM, survey volumes of order tens of cubic Gpc are required.
