 - **Abstract**
 The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is poised to observe thousands of quasars using the Deep Drilling Fields (DDF) across six broadband filters over a decade. Understanding quasar accretion disc (AD) time delays is pivotal for probing the physics of these distant objects. Pozo Nu\~nez et al. (2023) has recently demonstrated the feasibility of recovering AD time delays with accuracies ranging from 5\% to 20\%, depending on the quasar's redshift and time sampling intervals. Here we reassess the potential for measuring AD time delays under the current DDF observing cadence, which is placeholder until a final cadence is decided. We find that contrary to prior expectations, achieving reliable AD time delay measurements for quasars is significantly more challenging, if not unfeasible, due to the limitations imposed by the current observational strategies.

 - **Abstract**
 In 1953 I heard of an experiment in 1925 by Bengt Str\"omgren where he observed transit times with the meridian circle at the Copenhagen University Observatory measuring the current in a photocell behind slits when a star was crossing. In 1954 just 22 years old I was given the task as a student to make first test observations with a new meridian circle of the observatory. I became fascinated by the instrument and by the importance of astrometry for astronomy. Work at four meridian circles, two in Denmark, one in Hamburg, one in Lund, and Pierre Lacroute's vision of space astrometry in France had by 1973 created the foundation for development of the Hipparcos satellite, and Gaia followed. In 2013 I proposed a successor satellite which has gained momentum especially thanks to the efforts of David Hobbs and it has a good chance to be launched by ESA about 2045. But 70 years ago, optical astrometry was considered a dying branch of astronomy, unattractive compared with astrophysics. The following growth built on the still active interest in astrometry in Europe in those years and it was supported by ESA, the European Space Agency. This review is only about astrometry where I was personally involved.
#### Type Ia supernova explosion models are inherently multidimensional

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical and observational approaches to settle the important questions of the progenitor systems and the explosion mechanism of normal Type Ia supernovae thus far have failed. With its unique capability to obtain continuous spectra through the near- and mid-Infrared, JWST now offers completely new insights into Type Ia supernovae. In particular, observing them in the nebular phase allows us to directly see the central ejecta and thereby constrain the explosion mechanism. We aim to understand and quantify differences in the structure and composition of the central ejecta of various Type Ia supernova explosion models. We cover the currently most popular explosion scenarios using self-consistent multi-dimensional explosion simulations of delayed-detonation and pulsationally-assisted gravitationally-confined delayed detonation Chankdrasekhar-mass models, and double detonation sub-Chandrasekhar-mass and violent merger models. We focus on the distribution of radioactive and stable nickel in the final ejecta in density and velocity space. Of all models we study, we find that only in the double detonation scenario with a surviving companion the inner ejecta are anywhere close to spherical symmetry. It is thus crucial to simulate in particular Chandrasekhar-mass explosion models in 3D, because the lack of buoyancy in 1D models leads to an unphysical inverted stratification of radioactive and stable nickel in 1D models. The ejecta of Chandrasekhar-mass and sub-Chandrasekhar-mass merger models with an exploding secondary white dwarf are inherently 3D. In all of them nickel is distributed over a wide range of densities even at fixed velocity. Therefore, it is crucial to compute synthetic observables in the nebular phase, when the ejecta are optically thin, in 3D from the full 3D ejecta, because spherical averaging instead leads to unphysical ejecta properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio emission has been detected from tens of white dwarfs, in particular in accreting systems. Additionally, radio emission has been predicted as a possible outcome of a planetary system around a white dwarf. We searched for 3 GHz radio continuum emission in 846,000 candidate white dwarfs previously identified in Gaia using the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) Epoch 1 Quick Look Catalogue. We identified 13 candidate white dwarfs with a counterpart in VLASS within 2". Five of those were found not to be white dwarfs in follow-up or archival spectroscopy, whereas seven others were found to be chance alignments with a background source in higher-resolution optical or radio images. The remaining source, WDJ204259.71+152108.06, is found to be a white dwarf and M-dwarf binary with an orbital period of 4.1 days and long-term stochastic optical variability, as well as luminous radio and X-ray emission. For this binary, we find no direct evidence of a background contaminant, and a chance alignment probability of only ~2 per cent. However, other evidence points to the possibility of an unfortunate chance alignment with a background radio and X-ray emitting quasar, including an unusually poor Gaia DR3 astrometric solution for this source. With at most one possible radio emitting white dwarf found, we conclude that strong (> 1-3 mJy) radio emission from white dwarfs in the 3 GHz band is virtually nonexistent outside of interacting binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We present a new sub-grid model, HYACINTH -- HYdrogen And Carbon chemistry in the INTerstellar medium in Hydro simulations, for computing the non-equilibrium abundances of ${\rm H_2}$ and its carbon-based tracers, namely ${\rm CO}$, ${\rm C}$, and ${\rm C^+}$, in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Methods. The model accounts for the unresolved density structure in simulations using a variable probability distribution function of sub-grid densities and a temperature-density relation. Included is a simplified chemical network tailored for hydrogen and carbon chemistry within molecular clouds and easily integrated into large-scale simulations with minimal computational overhead. As an example, we apply HYACINTH to a simulated galaxy at redshift $z\sim2.5$ in post-processing and compare the resulting abundances with observations. Results. The chemical predictions from HYACINTH show a good agreement with high-resolution molecular-cloud simulations. We reproduce the $\rm H\,I - {\rm H_2}$ transition in the $f_{\rm H_2} - N_{\rm H}$ plane for both Milky-Way and LMC-like conditions. We also match the $N_{\rm CO} - N_{\rm H_2}$ values inferred from absorption measurements towards Milky-Way molecular clouds. Column density maps reveal that ${\rm CO}$ is concentrated in the peaks of the $\rm H_2$ distribution, while atomic carbon more broadly traces the bulk of ${\rm H_2}$ in our post-processed galaxy. Based on surface density profiles of stars and different gas species in the post-processed galaxy, we find that ${\rm C^+}$ extends farther than all other components and maintains a substantially high surface density out to $\sim 10 \, \rm kpc$. This is similar to the $[\rm C\,II]$ halos found in some recent observations at high redshifts.
#### The Primordial Black Hole Abundance: The Broader, the Better

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the abundance of primordial black holes, if formed through the collapse of large fluctuations generated during inflation and unless the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation is very peaked, is always dominated by the broadest profile of the compaction function, even though statistically it is not the most frequent. The corresponding threshold is therefore 2/5. This result exacerbates the tension when combining the primordial black hole abundance with the signal seen by pulsar timing arrays and originated from gravitational waves induced by the same large primordial perturbations.
#### Searching the SN 1987A SETI Ellipsoid with TESS

 - **Abstract**
 The SETI Ellipsoid is a strategy for technosignature candidate selection which assumes that extraterrestrial civilizations who have observed a galactic-scale event -- such as supernova 1987A -- may use it as a Schelling point to broadcast synchronized signals indicating their presence. Continuous wide-field surveys of the sky offer a powerful new opportunity to look for these signals, compensating for the uncertainty in their estimated time of arrival. We explore sources in the TESS continuous viewing zone, which corresponds to 5% of all TESS data, observed during the first three years of the mission. Using improved 3D locations for stars from Gaia Early Data Release 3, we identified 32 SN 1987A SETI Ellipsoid targets in the TESS continuous viewing zone with uncertainties better than 0.5 ly. We examined the TESS light curves of these stars during the Ellipsoid crossing event and found no anomalous signatures. We discuss ways to expand this methodology to other surveys, more targets, and different potential signal types.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the upGREAT instrument on SOFIA, we have imaged [C II] 157.74 and [O I] 63.18 micron line emission from a bright photodissociation region (PDR) associated with an ionized ``bubble'' located in the Nessie Nebula, a filamentary infrared dark cloud. A comparison with ATCA data reveals a classic PDR structure, with a uniform progression from ionized gas, to photodissociated gas, and on to molecular gas from the bubble's interior to its exterior. [O I] line emission from the bubble's PDR reveals self-absorption features. Toward a FIR-bright protostar, both [O I] and [C II] show an absorption feature at a velocity of $-18$ km/s, the same velocity as an unrelated foreground molecular cloud. Since the gas density in typical molecular clouds is well below the [O I] and [C II] critical densities, the excitation temperatures for both lines are low (~20 K). The Meudon models demonstrate that the surface of a molecular cloud, externally illuminated by a standard G_0 = 1 interstellar radiation field, can produce absorption features in both transitions. Thus, the commonly observed [O I] and [C II] self-absorption and absorption features plausibly arise from the subthermally excited, externally illuminated, photodissociated envelopes of molecular clouds. The luminous young stellar object AGAL337.916-00.477, located precisely where the expanding bubble strikes the Nessie filament, is associated with two shock tracers: NH3 (3,3) maser emission and SiO 2-1 emission, indicating interaction between the bubble and the filament. The interaction of the expanding bubble with its parental dense filament has triggered star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Dense core collisions, previously regarded as minor in star formation, are proposed to play a significant role in structure formation around protostellar envelopes and binary formation. Using archival data of nearby star-forming regions, we determine the frequencies of core collisions. Our calculations reveal that a typical core is likely to undergo multiple interactions with other cores throughout its lifetime. To further investigate the core collision process, we employ adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamic simulations with sink particles. Our simulations demonstrate that following the formation of a protostar within a gravitationally-unstable core, the merging core's accreting gas gives rise to a rotationally-supported circumstellar disk. Meanwhile, the region compressed by the shock between the cores develops into asymmetric arms that connect with the disk. Gas along these arms tends to migrate inward, ultimately falling toward the protostar. One of the arms, a remnant of the shock-compressed region, dominates over the second core gas, potentially exhibiting a distinct chemical composition. This is consistent with recent findings of large-scale streamers around protostars. Additionally, we found that collisions with velocities of $\sim$ 1.5 km s$^{-1}$ result in the formation of a binary system, as evidenced by the emergence of a sink particle within the dense section of the shocked layer. Overall, dense core collisions are highlighted as a critical process in creating $10^3$ au-scale streamers around protostellar systems and binary stars.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present the results from a study using the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) to search for radio {emission} from planets around three evolved stars namely $\alpha$~Tau, $\beta$~UMi, and $\beta$~Gem. Both $\alpha$~Tau and $\beta$~UMi host massive $\sim$ 6 $M_J$ mass planets at about $\sim$1.4 au from the central star, while $\beta$~Gem is host to a 2.9 $M_J$ mass planet at 1.7 au from the host star. We observe $\alpha$~Tau and $\beta$~ UMi at two u(upgraded)GMRT bands; band~3 (250-500~MHz) and band~4 (550-900~MHz). We also analyzed the archival observations from $\beta$ Gem at 150~MHz from GMRT. We did not detect any radio signals from these systems. At 400~MHz, the 3$\sigma$ upper limit is 87 $\mu$Jy/beam for $\alpha$~Tau~{b} and 77.4 $\mu$Jy/beam for $\beta$~UMi~{b}. From our observations at 650~MHz, we place a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 28.2 $\mu$Jy/beam for $\alpha$~Tau~b and 33.6 $\mu$Jy/beam for $\beta$~UMi~b. For $\beta$ Gem b, at 150~MHz, we place an upper limit of 2.5 mJy. At 400~MHz and 650~MHz, our observations are the deepest radio images for any exoplanetary system.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the major challenges we face is how to quickly and accurately create the three-dimensional (3D) density distributions of interstellar dust in the Milky Way using extinction and distance measurements of large samples of stars. In this study, we introduce a novel machine-learning approach that utilizes a convolution neural network, specifically a V-net, to infer the 3D distribution of dust density. Experiments are performed within two regions located towards the Galactic anti-center. The neural network is trained and tested using 10,000 simulations of dust density and line-of-sight extinction maps. Evaluation of the test sample confirms the successful generation of dust density maps from extinction maps by our model. Additionally, the performance of the trained network is evaluated using data from the literature. Our results demonstrate that our model is capable of capturing detailed dust density variations and can recover dust density maps while reducing the ``fingers of god" effect. Moving forward, we plan to apply this model to real observational data to obtain the fine distribution of dust at large and small scales in the Milky Way.
#### Prospects for joint reconstruction of imaging air Cherenkov Telescope  array and extensive air shower array

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we proposed a joint reconstruction of \gray events using both extensive air array (EAS) and Imaging air Cherenkov Telescope array (IACT). We considered eight Cherenkov telescopes to be built on the LHAASO (Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory) site and investigate the improvement in differential sensitivity when combining the information from both IACT and Moun detectors of LHAASO-KM2A. We found that due to the higher cosmic ray background rejection power and higher gamma ray retention ratio provided by muon detectors of LHAASO, such a joint reconstruction can significantly improve the sensitivity of IACTs, especially for extended sources and long exposure time. In this article, we have shown the performance of an eight-telescopes mini array, and our results indicate that above $10~\rm TeV$, the sensitivity can be improved by muon detector from $25\% - 60\%$ in different energy ranges.
#### Different behaviors of wavelet results for type-B and type-C QPOs of  MAXI J1535-571 based on NICER data

 - **Abstract**
 Wavelet analysis, in addition to power density spectra, is another method to study the quasi-periodic signals in the light curves, but has been rarely used in black hole X-ray transients. We performed wavelet analysis of X-ray timing features and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) based on NICER observations of the black hole candidate MAXI J1535-571 in this paper. Separating the light curves by the confidence level of wavelet results, we find significant differences exist in the PDS, hardness ratio and mean count between light curve segments above and below the confidence level. The S-factor, which is defined as the ratio of the effective oscillation time and the total time, demonstrates distinct values between type-C and type-B QPOs. Based on our results, the S-factor for type-B QPO is very close or equal to 0, no matter the confidence level is set as 95\% or 68\%, while the S-factor of type-C QPO is significantly higher, especially in the 68\% confidence level case. We discuss the implications of the wavelet results on resolving type-B and type-C QPOs in black hole X-ray binaries.
#### Partial Ly$α$ thermalization in an analytic nonlinear diffusion  model

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11320
 - **Abstract**
 During recombination, the cosmic background radiation is disturbed, in particular, by Lyman-alpha emissions from neutral hydrogen. It is proposed to account for the subsequent time-dependent partial thermalization of the Lyman-alpha energy content in an analytically solvable nonlinear diffusion model. The amplitude of the partially thermalized and redshifted Ly-$\alpha$ line is found to be too low to be visible in the cosmic microwave spectrum, in accordance with previous numerical models and Planck observations.
#### Investigating the Hard State of MAXI J1820+070: A Comprehensive Bayesian  Approach to Black Hole Spin and Accretion Properties

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse the X-ray spectrum of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 using observations from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR during 'hard' states of its 2018-2019 outburst. We take a fully Bayesian approach, and this is one of the first papers to present a fully Bayesian workflow for the analysis of an X-ray binary X-ray spectrum. This allows us to leverage the relatively well-understood distance and binary system properties (like inclination and black hole mass), as well as information from the XMM-Newton RGS data to assess the foreground X-ray absorption. We employ a spectral model for a `vanilla' disc-corona system: the disc is flat and in the plane perpendicular to the axis of the jet and the black hole spin, the disc extends inwards to the innermost stable circular orbit around the black hole, and the (non-thermal) hard X-ray photons are up-scattered soft X-ray photons originating from the disc thermal emission. Together, these provide tight constraints on the spectral model and, in combination with the strong prior information about the system, mean we can then constrain other parameters that are poorly understood such as the disc colour correction factor. By marginalising over all the parameters, we calculate a posterior density for the black hole spin parameter, $a$. Our modelling suggests a preference for low or negative spin values, although this could plausibly be reproduced by higher spins and a modest degree of disc truncation. This approach demonstrates the efficacy and some of the complexities of Bayesian methods for X-ray spectral analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 The Parkes 20 cm Multibeam pulsar surveys have discovered nearly half of the known pulsars and revealed many distant pulsars with high dispersion measures. Using a sample of 1,301 pulsars from these surveys, we have explored the spatial distribution and birth rate of normal pulsars. The pulsar distances used to calculate the pulsar surface density are estimated from the YMW16 electron-density model. When estimating the impact of the Galactic background radiation on our survey, we projected pulsars in the Galaxy onto the Galactic plane, assuming that the flux density distribution of pulsars is uniform in all directions, and utilized the most up-to-date background temperature map. We also used an up-to-date version of the ATNF Pulsar Catalogue to model the distribution of pulsar flux densities at 1400 MHz. We derive an improved radial distribution for the pulsar surface density projected on to the Galactic plane, which has a maximum value at $\sim$4 kpc from the Galactic Centre. We also derive the local surface density and birthrate of pulsars, obtaining 47 $\pm$ 5 $\mathrm{kpc^{-2}}$ and $\sim$ 4.7 $\pm$ 0.5 $\mathrm{kpc^{-2}\ Myr^{-1}}$, respectively. For the total number of potentially detectable pulsars in the Galaxy, we obtain (1.1 $\pm$ 0.2) $\times$ $10^{4}$ and (1.1 $\pm$ 0.2) $\times$ $10^{5}$ before and after applying the TM98 beaming correction model. The radial distribution function is used to estimate the proportion of pulsars in each spiral arm and the Galactic centre.

 - **Abstract**
 The ring-like structures in protoplanetary discs that are observed in the cold dust emission by ALMA, might be explained by dust aggregates trapped aerodynamically in pressure maxima. The effect of a transient pressure maximum is investigated that develops between two regimes with different turbulent levels. We study how such a pressure maximum collects dust aggregates and transforms them into large planetesimals and Moon-mass cores that can further grow to a few Earth-mass planets by pebble accretion, and eventually to giant planets, by considering the accretion of a gaseous envelope. A numerical model is developed, incorporating the evolution of gaseous disc, growth and transport of pebbles, N-body interactions of growing planetary cores and their backreaction to gas disc by opening a partial gap. Planetesimal formation by streaming instability is parametrized in our model. A transient pressure maximum efficiently accumulates dust particles that can grow larger than mm-size. If this happens, dust aggregates can be transformed by the streaming instability process into such large planetesimals, which can grow further by pebble accretion, according to our assumptions. As the gas evolves to its steady state, the pressure maximum vanishes, and the concentrated pebbles that are not transformed to planetesimals and accreted by the growing planet, drift inward. During this inward drift, if the conditions of the streaming instability are met, planetesimals are formed in a wide radial range of the disc. Conclusions. A transient pressure maximum is a favourable place for planetesimal and planet formation during its lifetime and the concentration of pebbles induces continuous formation of planetesimals even after its disappearance. Besides, the formation of a planet can trigger the formation of planetesimals over a wide area of the protoplanetary disc.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of first ever spectro-polarimetric analyses of the Galactic ultra-luminous X-ray pulsar Swift J0243.6$+6124$ during the 2023 outburst using quasi-simultaneous {\it IXPE}, {\it NICER} and {\it NuSTAR} observations. A pulsation of period $\sim 9.79$ s is detected in {\it IXPE} and {\it NuSTAR} observations with pulse fractions (PFs) $\sim 18\%$ ($2-8$ keV) and $\sim 28\%$ ($3-78$ keV), respectively. Energy-dependent study of the pulse profiles with {\it NuSTAR} indicates an increase in PF from $\sim 27\%$ ($3-10$ keV) to $\sim 50\%$ ($40-78$ keV). Further, epoch-dependent polarimetric measurements during decay phase of the outburst confirm the detection of significant polarization degree (PD) varying as $\sim 2-3.1\%$ with polarization angle $\sim 8.6^{\circ}-10.8^{\circ}$ in $2-8$ keV energy range. We also observe that PD increases up to $\sim 4.8\%$ at higher energies ($\gtrsim 5$ keV) with dominating \texttt{bbodyrad} flux contribution ($1.5 \lesssim F_{\rm BB}/F_{\rm PL} \lesssim 3.4$) in {\it IXPE} spectra. The phase-resolved polarimetric study yields PD as $\sim 1.7-3.1\%$ suggesting a marginal correlation with the pulse profiles. Moreover, the broad-band ($0.6-70$ keV) energy spectrum of combined {\it NICER} and {\it NuSTAR} observations is well described by the combination of \texttt{bbodyrad} and \texttt{cutoffpl} components with seed photon temperature ($kT_{\rm bb}$) $\sim 0.86 \pm 0.03$ keV and photon index ($\Gamma$) $\sim 0.98 \pm 0.01$. With the above findings, we infer that the observed `low' PD in Swift J0243.6$+6124$ is resulted possibly due to `vacuum resonance' effect occurred between the overheated and relatively cooler regions of the neutron star boundary layer.

 - **Abstract**
 For decades, the boundary of cosmic filaments have been a subject of debate. In this work, we determine the physically-motivated radii of filaments by constructing stacked galaxy number density profiles around the filament spines. We find that the slope of the profile changes with distance to the filament spine, reaching its minimum at approximately 1 Mpc at z = 0 in both state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations and observational data. This can be taken as the average value of the filament radius. Furthermore, we note that the average filament radius rapidly decreases from z = 4 to z = 1, and then slightly increases. Moreover, we find that the filament radius depends on the filament length, the distance from connected clusters, and the masses of the clusters. These results suggest a two-phase formation scenario of cosmic filaments. The filaments experience rapid contraction before z = 1, but their density distribution has remained roughly stable since then. The subsequent mass transport along the filaments to the connected clusters is likely to have contributed to the formation of the clusters themselves.

 Observations of high-redshift quasars hosting billion solar mass black holes at $z\gtrsim6$ challenge our understanding of early supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. In this work, we conduct a near-infrared spectroscopic study of $19$ quasars at $6.2\lesssim z\lesssim 7.5$, using the Folded-port InfraRed Echellette (FIRE) instrument on the $6.5$-meter Magellan/Baade Telescope. We estimate the single-epoch masses of the quasars' SMBHs by means of the MgII emission line and find black hole masses of $M_{\text{BH}} \approx(0.2-4.8)\,\times\,10^9\,M_\odot$. Furthermore, we measure the sizes of the quasars' proximity zones, which are regions of enhanced transmitted flux bluewards of the Ly$\alpha\,$ emission line, ionized by the quasars' radiation itself. While it has been shown that the proximity zone sizes correlate with the quasars' lifetimes due to the finite response time of the intergalactic medium to the quasars' radiation, we do not find any correlation between the proximity zone sizes and the black hole mass, which suggests that quasar activity and the concomitant black hole growth are intermittent and episodic.
#### Probing the accretion geometry of the atoll neutron star 4U 1702-429 in  different spectral states with NICER, NuSTAR, and AstroSat

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a comprehensive spectral study of a carefully selected sample (total exposure $\sim 50.5$ ks) of NICER observations of the atoll neutron star low mass X-ray binary 4U 1702-429. Our sample encompasses nearly all classical spectral states found within the NICER dataset. We require two thermal emission components, originating from the accretion disc and the boundary layer, to describe the soft state spectra in the energy band 0.3-10.0 keV. In contrast, in our model, only the disc component directly contributes to the intermediate/hard state. Additionally, we use a thermally Comptonised component (or a power-law with pegged normalisation) to represent the hard coronal emission in the soft and intermediate/hard state spectra. The boundary layer emerges as the principal source providing soft seed photons for Comptonisation across all spectral states. In contrast to a previously held assertion regarding this source, our analyses reveal a decrease in the inner disc temperature coupled with the retreat of the inner disc from the NS surface as the source evolves from the soft to the intermediate/hard state. The reflection features are either absent or weak ($\sim 3-4\sigma$) in all these observations. Further investigation using broad-band NuSTAR (3.0-50.0 keV) and AstroSat spectra (1.3-25.0 keV) shows a slightly stronger iron emission line ($\sim 5.8\sigma$) in the NuSTAR spectra. However, this feature is not significantly detected in the AstroSat observation. The AstroSat data suggests a highly ionised disc, explaining the absence of reflection features. In the case of NuSTAR, a truncated disc is likely responsible for the weak reflection features.

 We present Submillimeter Array (SMA) mapping of $^{12}$CO $J=2\rightarrow 1$, $^{13}$CO $J=2\rightarrow 1$, and CN $N=2\rightarrow 1$ emission from the Ring-like planetary nebula (PN) NGC 3132, one of the subjects of JWST Early Release Observation (ERO) near-infrared imaging. The $\sim$5$''$ resolution SMA data demonstrate that the Southern Ring's main, bright, molecule-rich ring is indeed an expanding ring, as opposed to a limb-brightened shell, in terms of its intrinsic (physical) structure. This suggests that NGC 3132 is a bipolar nebula viewed more or less pole-on (inclination $\sim$15--30$^\circ$). The SMA data furthermore reveal that the nebula harbors a second expanding molecular ring that is aligned almost orthogonally to the main, bright molecular ring. We propose that this two-ring structure is the remnant of an ellipsoidal molecular envelope of ejecta that terminated the progenitor star's asymptotic giant branch evolution and was subsequently disrupted by a series of misaligned fast, collimated outflows or jets resulting from interactions between the progenitor and one or more companions.
#### Searching for QPOs in BATSE Short Gamma-ray Bursts Based on Narrowband  and Broadband Features

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), especially short GRBs, are often considered potential candidates for exhibiting kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) due to their origin from binary mergers. It has already been discovered that two bursts exhibit QPOs. While systematic searches for QPOs in GRBs typically concentrate on the kilohertz range, there has been no comprehensive exploration in the hundred-hertz range. In this study, we systematically conducted QPO searches on all BATSE short burst data within the 0-1000 Hz range. Using nested significance tests, we observed that the reference distributions for different GRBs are quite similar. This observation prompted us to analyze the data by selectively focusing on those with larger statistical values, obviating the need to iterate through all the data and significantly reducing computational workload. Ultimately, our findings did not reveal any compelling evidence for QPOs, which may suggest that the GRB jet has lost the early merging memory.

 - **Abstract**
 HESS J1813-178 is one of the brightest and most compact TeV $\gamma$-ray sources, and whether its $\gamma$-ray emission is associated with supernova remnant (SNR), pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or young stellar cluster (YSC) is still under debate. By analysing the GeV $\gamma$-ray data in the field of HESS J1813-178 using 14 years of PASS 8 data recorded by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), we report the discovery of three different sources with different spectra in this region. The hard source with a power law spectral index of 2.11 $\pm$ 0.08 has a small size extension, which is spatially and spectrally coincident with the TeV $\gamma$-ray emission from HESS J1813-178. CO observations display the dense molecular clouds surrounding HESS J1813-178 in the velocity range of 45-60 km s$^{\rm -1}$. The possible origins of the $\gamma$-ray emission from HESS J1813-178 are discussed, including SNR G12.82-0.02, the PWN driven by the energetic X-ray pulsar PSR J1813-1749, and YSC Cl 1813-178. However, none of them can be ruled out clearly. Note that the maximum energy of protons in the hadronic model should exceed a few hundred TeV, which makes HESS J1813-178 to be a promising PeVatron. The detailed LHAASO data analysis about the morphology and spectrum would be helpful to investigate the origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission in this region and test its PeVatron nature.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a spectral analysis using simultaneous multifrequency (22, 43, 86, and 129 GHz) very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of the Korean VLBI Network (KVN) on BL Lac object, Markarian 421 (Mrk 421). The data we used was obtained from January 2013 to June 2018. The light curves showed several flux enhancements with global decreases. To separate the variable and quiescent components in the multifrequency light curves for milliarcsecond-scale emission regions, we assumed that the quiescent radiation comes from the emission regions radiating constant optically-thin synchrotron emissions (i.e., a minimum flux density with an optically thin spectral index). The quiescent spectrum determined from the multifrequency light curves was subtracted from the total CLEAN flux density, yielding a variable component in the flux that produces the time-dependent spectrum. We found that the observed spectra were flat at 22-43 GHz, and relatively steep at 43-86 GHz, whereas the quiescent-corrected spectra are sometimes quite different from the observed spectra (e.g., sometimes inverted at 22-43 GHz ). The quiescent-corrected spectral indices were much more variable than the observed spectral indices. This spectral investigation implies that the quiescent-spectrum correction can significantly affect the multifrequency spectral index of variable compact radio sources such as blazars. Therefore, the synchrotron self-absorption B-field strength (B_SSA) can be significantly affected because B_SSA is proportional to the fifth power of turnover frequency.

 - **Abstract**
 Our analysis focus on the dragging effects on the accretion flows and jet emission in Kerr super-spinars. These attractors are characterized by peculiar accretion structures as double tori, or special dragged tori in the ergoregion, produced by the balance of the hydrodynamic and centrifugal forces and also effects of super-spinars repulsive gravity. We investigate the accretion flows, constituted by particles and photons, from toroids orbiting a central Kerr super-spinar. As results of our analysis, in both accretion and jet flows, properties characterizing these geometries, that constitute possible strong observational signatures or these attractors, are highlighted. We found that the flow is characterized by closed surfaces, defining inversion coronas (spherical shell), with null the particles flow toroidal velocity ($u^\phi=0$) embedding the central singularity. We proved that this region distinguishes proto-jets and accretion driven flows, co-rotating and counter-rotating flows. Therefore in both cases the flow carries information about the accretion structures around the central attractor, demonstrating that inversion points can constitute an observational aspect capable of distinguishing the super-spinars.

 - **Abstract**
 Disc winds and planet-disc interactions are two crucial mechanisms that define the structure, evolution and dispersal of protoplanetary discs. While winds are capable of removing material from discs, eventually leading to their dispersal, massive planets can shape their disc by creating sub-structures such as gaps and spiral arms. We study the interplay between an X-ray photoevaporative disc wind and the substructures generated due to planet-disc interactions to determine how their mutual interactions affect the disc's and the planet's evolution. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of viscous ($\alpha = 6.9\cdot10^{-4}$) discs that host a Jupiter-like planet and undergo X-ray photoevaporation. We trace the gas flows within the disc and wind and measure the accretion rate onto the planet, as well as the gravitational torque that is acting on it. Our results show that the planetary gap takes away the wind's pressure support, allowing wind material to fall back into the gap. This opens new pathways for material from the inner disc (and part of the outer disc) to be redistributed through the wind towards the gap. Consequently, the gap becomes shallower, and the flow of mass across the gap in both directions is significantly increased, as well as the planet's mass-accretion rate (by factors $\approx 5$ and $\approx 2$, respectively). Moreover, the wind-driven redistribution results in a denser inner disc and less dense outer disc, which, combined with the recycling of a significant portion of the inner wind, leads to longer lifetimes of the inner disc, contrary to the expectation in a planet-induced photoevaporation (PIPE) scenario that has been proposed in the past.

 - **Abstract**
 The fourth-DR3 version (4FGL-DR3) of the Fermi/LAT catalogue of $\gamma$-ray sources contains $\sim$ 1000 objects at a galactic latitude |b| > 10$^{\circ}$ which are not identified with an optical counterpart (UGS). We performed a systematic study of these sources, focusing on 190 objects that have a unique X-ray counterpart in the available Swift/XRT observations. Optical counterparts are then selected, and for 33 sources optical spectra were found in the literature. We found that 21 can be classified as BL Lac objects. Among these we were able to provide the redshift for 8 of them while for 2 others we established a lower limit to the redshift by detecting intervening absorption. The other 12 objects display optical spectra with prominent emission lines (0.036<z<1.65). These spectra are characterized by both broad and narrow emission lines with the exception of 3 sources. One of them displays only broad emission lines, while the other two exclusively exhibit narrow lines. On the basis of the radio/optical flux ratio, all BL Lac objects in this study are radio loud. Four sources out of the 12 with prominent emission lines can be classified as radio loud, while at least 5 of the 12 sources with prominent lines are radio quiet. This is somewhat unexpected comparing with the radio-loudness distribution of the 4FGL-associated blazars.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, millisecond-duration radio bursts of cosmic origin. There have been several dozen FRBs found to repeat. Among them, those precisely localized provide the best opportunity to probe their multi-wavelength counterparts, local environment, and host galaxy that would reveal their origins. Here we report our X-ray, ultraviolet (UV) and optical observations with the $Swift$ satellite that were performed simultaneously in the radio band with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) observations of the repeating FRB 20190520B, aiming at detection of possible multi-wavelength bursts in association with radio bursts and multi-wavelength counterpart of the persistent radio source (PRS). While a total of 10 radio bursts were detected by FAST at the same time of $Swift$ observations, we detected neither X-ray, UV or optical bursts in accompany of the radio bursts, nor persistent multi-wavelength counterpart of the PRS. We obtained the energy upper limits ($3\sigma$) on any multi-wavelength bursts as $5.03 \times 10^{47}$ erg in the hard X-ray band (15-150 keV), $7.98 \times 10^{45}$ erg in the soft X-ray band (0.3-10 keV), and $4.51 \times 10^{44}$ erg in the U band, respectively. The energy ratio between soft X-ray (0.3-10 keV) and radio emission of the bursts is constrained as $<6\times10^{7}$, and the ratio between optical (U band) and radio as $<1.19\times10^{6}$. The 3$\sigma$ luminosity upper limits at the position of PRS are 1.04$\times10^{47}$ (15-150 keV), 8.81$\times10^{42}$ (0.3-10 keV), 9.26$\times10^{42}$ (UVW1), and 2.54$\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (U), respectively. We show that the PRS is much more radio loud than representative pulsar wind nebulae, supernova remnants, extended jet of Galactic X-ray binaries and ultraluminous X-ray sources, suggestive of boosted radio emission of the PRS.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of the first transiting hot Jupiters (HJs; giant planets on orbital periods shorter than $P\sim10$ days) was announced more than twenty years ago. As both ground- and space-based follow-up observations are piling up, we are approaching the temporal baseline required to detect secular variations in their orbital parameters. In particular, several recent studies focused on constraining the efficiency of the tidal decay mechanism to better understand the evolutionary time scales of HJ migration and engulfment. This can be achieved by measuring a monotonic decrease of orbital period $\mathrm{d}P/\mathrm{d}t<0$ due to mechanical energy being dissipated by tidal friction. WASP-12b was the first HJ for which a tidal decay scenario appeared convincing, even though alternative explanations have been hypothesized. Here we present a new analysis based on 28 unpublished high-precision transit light curves gathered over a twelve-year baseline and combined with all the available archival data, and an updated set of stellar parameters from HARPS-N high-resolution spectra, which are consistent with a main sequence scenario, close to the hydrogen exhaustion in the core. Our values of $\mathrm{d}P/\mathrm{d}t$ = $-30.72 \pm 2.67$ and $Q_{\ast}^{'}$ = $(2.13 \pm 0.18) \times 10^{5}$ are statistically consistent with previous studies, and indicate that WASP-12 is undergoing fast tidal dissipation. We additionally report the presence of an excess scatter in the timing data and discuss its possible origin.

 - **Abstract**
 Unraveling the internal kinematics of open clusters is crucial for understanding their formation and evolution. However, there is a dearth of research on this topic, primarily due to the lack of high-quality kinematic data. Using the exquisite-precision astrometric parameters and radial velocities provided by Gaia data release 3, we investigate the internal rotation in three of the most nearby and best-studied open clusters, namely the Pleiades, Alpha Persei, and Hyades clusters. Statistical analyses of the residual motions of the member stars clearly indicate the presence of three-dimensional rotation in the three clusters. The mean rotation velocities of the Pleiades, Alpha Persei, and Hyades clusters within their tidal radii are estimated to be 0.24 (0.04), 0.43 (0.08), and 0.09 (0.03) km s-1, respectively. Similar to the Praesepe cluster that we have studied before, the rotation of the member stars within the tidal radii of these three open clusters can be well interpreted by Newton's theorem. No expansion or contraction is detected in the three clusters either. Furthermore, we find that the mean rotation velocity of open clusters may be positively correlated with the cluster mass, and the rotation is likely to diminish as open clusters age.

 - **Abstract**
 Anisotropies in the distance-redshift relation of cosmological sources are expected due to large-scale inhomogeneities in the local Universe. When the observed sources are tracing a large-scale matter flow in a general spacetime geometry, the distance-redshift relation with its anisotropies can be described with a geometrical prediction that generalises the well-known Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker result. Furthermore, it turns out that a finite set of multipole coefficients contain the full information about a finite-order truncation of the distance-redshift relation of a given observer. The multipoles of the distance-redshift relation are interesting new cosmological observables that have a direct physical interpretation in terms of kinematical quantities of the underlying matter flow. Using light cones extracted from $N$-body simulations we quantify the anisotropies expected in a $\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmology by running a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis on the observed data. In this observational approach the survey selection implements an implicit smoothing scale over which the effective rest frame of matter is fitted. The perceived anisotropy therefore depends significantly on the redshift range and distribution of sources. We find that the multipoles of the expansion rate, as well as the observer's velocity with respect to the large-scale matter flow, can be determined robustly with our approach.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years the gas kinematics probed by molecular lines detected with ALMA has opened a new window to study protoplanetary disks. High spatial and spectral resolution observations have revealed the complexity of protoplanetary disk structure and correctly interpreting these data allow us to gain a better comprehension of the planet formation process. We investigate the impact of thermal stratification on the azimuthal velocity of protoplanetary disks. High resolution gas observations are showing velocity differences between CO isotopologues, which cannot be adequately explained with vertically isothermal models. The aim of this work is to determine whether a stratified model can explain this discrepancy. We analytically solve the hydrostatic equilibrium for a stratified disk and we derive the azimuthal velocity. We test the model with SPH numerical simulations and then we use it to fit for star mass, disk mass and scale radius of the sources in the MAPS sample. In particular, we use 12CO and 13CO datacubes.

 - **Abstract**
 We have shown in a recent study, using 3D climate simulations, that dayside land cover has a substantial impact on the climate of a synchronously rotating temperate rocky planet such as Proxima Centauri b. Building on that result, we generate synthetic transit spectra from our simulations to assess the impact of these land-induced climate uncertainties on water vapour transit signals. We find that distinct climate regimes will likely be very difficult to differentiate in transit spectra, even under the more favourable conditions of smaller planets orbiting ultracool dwarfs. Further, we show that additional climate ambiguities arise when both land cover and atmosphere mass are unknown, as is likely to be the case for transiting planets. While water vapour may be detectable under favourable conditions, it may be nearly impossible to infer a rocky planet's surface conditions or climate state from its transit spectrum due to the interdependent effects of land cover and atmosphere mass on surface temperature, humidity, and terminator cloud cover.

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST MIRI MRS observations of the edge-on protoplanetary disk around the young sub-solar mass star Tau 042021, acquired as part of the Cycle 1 GO program "Mapping Inclined Disk Astrochemical Signatures (MIDAS)." These data resolve the mid-IR spatial distributions of H$_2$, revealing X-shaped emission extending to ~200 au above the disk midplane with a semi-opening angle of $35 \pm 5$ degrees. We do not velocity-resolve the gas in the spectral images, but the measured semi-opening angle of the H$_2$ is consistent with an MHD wind origin. A collimated, bipolar jet is seen in forbidden emission lines from [Ne II], [Ne III], [Ni II], [Fe II], [Ar II], and [S III]. Extended H$_2$O and CO emission lines are also detected, reaching diameters between ~90 and 190 au, respectively. Hot molecular emission is not expected at such radii, and we interpret its extended spatial distribution as scattering of inner disk molecular emission by dust grains in the outer disk surface. H I recombination lines, characteristic of inner disk accretion shocks, are similarly extended, and are likely also scattered light from the innermost star-disk interface. Finally, we detect extended PAH emission at 11.3 microns co-spatial with the scattered light continuum, making this the first low-mass T Tauri star around which extended PAHs have been confirmed, to our knowledge. MIRI MRS line images of edge-on disks provide an unprecedented window into the outflow, accretion, and scattering processes within protoplanetary disks, allowing us to constrain the disk lifetimes and accretion and mass loss mechanisms.

 Stellar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from host stars are an important factor that affects the habitability of exoplanets. Although their solar counterparts have been well observed for decades, it is still very difficult to find solid evidence of stellar CMEs. Using the spectral line profile asymmetry caused by the Doppler shift of erupting plasma, several stellar CME candidates have been identified from spectral lines formed at chromospheric or transition region temperatures of the stars. However, a successful detection of stellar CME signals based on the profile asymmetries of coronal lines is still lacking. It is unclear whether we can detect such signals. Here we construct an analytical model for CMEs on solar-type stars, and derive an expression of stellar extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) line profiles during CME eruptions. For different instrumental parameters, exposure times, CME propagation directions and stellar activity levels, we synthesized the corresponding line profiles of Fe IX 171.07 \AA\ and Fe XV 284.16 \AA. Further investigations provide constraints on the instrumental requirements for successful detection and characterization of stellar CMEs. Our results show that it is possible to detect stellar CME signals and infer their velocities based on spectral profile asymmetries using an EUV spectrometer with a moderate spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Our work provides important references for the design of future EUV spectrometers for stellar CME detection and the development of observation strategies.

 Stellar multiplicity is a key aspect of exoplanet diversity, as the presence of more than one star in a planetary system can have both devastating and positive effects on its formation and evolution. In this paper, we present the results of a Lucky Imaging survey of 212 exoplanet host stars performed with AstraLux at CAHA 2.2 m. The survey includes data from seven observing epochs between August 2015 and September 2020, and data for individual targets from four earlier observing epochs. The targets of this survey are nearby, bright, solar-like stars with high proper motions. In total, we detected 46 co-moving companions of 43 exoplanet host stars. Accordingly, this survey shows that the minimum multiplicity rate of exoplanet host stars is 20 $\pm$ 3 %. In total, 33 binary and ten hierarchical triple star systems with exoplanets have been identified. All companions were found to have a common proper motion with the observed exoplanet host stars, and with our astrometry we even find evidence of orbital motion for 28 companions. For all targets, we determined the detection limit and explore the detection space for possible additional companions of these stars. Based on the reached detection limit, additional co-moving companions beyond the detected ones can be excluded around all observed exoplanet host stars. The increasing number of exoplanets discovered in multiple stellar systems suggests that the formation of planets in such systems is by no means rare, but common. Therefore, our study highlights the need to consider stellar multiplicity in future studies of exoplanet habitability.

 - **Abstract**
 Earth's surface is deficient in available forms of many elements considered limiting for prebiotic chemistry. In contrast, many extraterrestrial rocky objects are rich in these same elements. Limiting prebiotic ingredients may, therefore, have been delivered by exogenous material; however, the mechanisms by which exogeneous material may be reliably and non-destructively supplied to a planetary surface remains unclear. Today, the flux of extraterrestrial matter to Earth is dominated by fine-grained cosmic dust. Although this material is rarely discussed in a prebiotic context due to its delivery over a large surface area, concentrated cosmic dust deposits are known to form on Earth today due to the action of sedimentary processes. Here we combine empirical constraints on dust sedimentation with dynamical simulations of dust formation and planetary accretion to show that localized sedimentary deposits of cosmic dust could have accumulated in arid environments on early Earth, in particular glacial settings that today produce cryoconite sediments. Our results challenge the widely held assumption that cosmic dust is incapable of fertilizing prebiotic chemistry. Cosmic dust deposits may have plausibly formed on early Earth and acted to fertilize prebiotic chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates accelerated cosmic expansion using various cosmological models within Horava-Lifshitz gravity, including BBCCFHKO, Seljak, ASSS, PADE-I, PADE-II, and BAZS, utilizing Equation of State Parametrization. To constrain the cosmological parameters of each model, we incorporate 24 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation points, 30 Cosmic Chronometer points, 40 Type Ia Supernovae points, 24 quasar Hubble diagram points, and 162 Gamma Ray Bursts points, along with the latest Hubble constant measurement (R22). We treat $r_{d}$ as a free parameter, aiming to extract $H_{0}$ and $r_{d}$ using late-time datasets and obtain optimal fitting values for each parameter in every model. The benefits of treating $r_{d}$ as a free parameter include reduced bias, improved precision, and enhanced dataset compatibility. The resulting values of $H_{0}$ and $r_{d}$ are relative to the $\Lambda$CDM model, showcasing alignment with early Planck and SDSS estimations. We additionally minimize errors by simulating random correlations in the covariance matrix. Furthermore, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) support all models, with the $\Lambda$CDM model exhibiting the lowest AIC. Evaluation via reduced chi-square statistic confirms reasonable fits for all models. While $\Lambda$CDM remains favored, extensions warrant further investigation. This study underscores the importance of exploring alternative cosmological models to deepen our understanding of the universe's fundamental properties and evolution. Continued refinement of models is essential for advancing cosmological research.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies have suggested the possibility of Hycean worlds, characterised by deep liquid water oceans beneath H$_2$-rich atmospheres. These planets significantly widen the range of planetary properties over which habitable conditions could exist. We conduct internal structure modelling of Hycean worlds to investigate the range of interior compositions, ocean depths and atmospheric mass fractions possible. Our investigation explicitly considers habitable oceans, where the surface conditions are limited to those that can support potential life. The ocean depths depend on the surface gravity and temperature, confirming previous studies, and span 10s to $\sim$1000 km for Hycean conditions, reaching ocean base pressures up to $\sim$6$\times$10$^4$ bar before transitioning to high-pressure ice. We explore in detail test cases of five Hycean candidates, placing constraints on their possible ocean depths and interior compositions based on their bulk properties. We report limits on their atmospheric mass fractions admissible for Hycean conditions, as well as those allowed for other possible interior compositions. For the Hycean conditions considered, across these candidates we find the admissible mass fractions of the H/He envelopes to be $\lesssim$10$^{-3}$. At the other extreme, the maximum H/He mass fractions allowed for these planets can be up to $\sim$4-8$\%$, representing purely rocky interiors with no H$_2$O layer. These results highlight the diverse conditions possible among these planets and demonstrate their potential to host habitable conditions under vastly different circumstances to the Earth. Upcoming JWST observations of candidate Hycean worlds will allow for improved constraints on the nature of their atmospheres and interiors.
#### Constraining tachyonic inflationary β-exponential model with  Continuous Spontaneous Localization collapse scheme

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we consider the dynamics of the self-induced collapse of the tachyon wave function in inflationary scenarios. We analyze the modifications on the power spectrum by considering the \beta-exponential potential, whose parameters have updated constraints by the Planck 2018 baseline data. Moreover, we show that for this kind of potential, just for a narrow range of \beta-parameter, there is agreement between the theoretical predictions and the current observational data. Considering the proposal for a collapse scheme that leads to the modification of Schr\"odinger evolution of the inflaton wave function from the employment of a Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) approach, we derive the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio. We then obtained the constraints on both collapse and \beta-parameters that, in turn, yield deviations in the n_{s} vs. r plane when compared to the \beta-exponential potential standard estimate. The CSL scheme applied to tachyonic inflation driven by a \beta-potential offers an adequate description of the recent data.

 - **Abstract**
 With the new generation of space telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it is possible to better characterize the atmospheres of exoplanets. The atmospheres of Hot and Ultra Hot Jupiters are highly heterogeneous and asymmetrical. The difference between the temperatures on the day-side and the night-side is especially extreme in the case of Ultra Hot Jupiters. We introduce a new tool to compute synthetic lightcurves from 3D GCM simulations, developed in the Pytmosph3R framework. We show how rotation induces a variation of the flux during the transit that is a source of information on the chemical and thermal distribution of the atmosphere. We find that the day-night gradient linked to Ultra Hot Jupiters has an effect close to the stellar limb-darkening, but opposite to tidal deformation. We confirm the impact of the atmospheric and chemical distribution on variations of the central transit time, though the variations found are smaller than that of available observational data, which could indicate that the east-west asymmetries are underestimated, due to the chemistry or clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission measured light from stars in ~85% of the sky throughout its two-year primary mission, resulting in millions of TESS 30-minute cadence light curves to analyze in the search for transiting exoplanets. To search this vast dataset, we aim to provide an approach that is both computationally efficient, produces highly performant predictions, and minimizes the required human search effort. We present a convolutional neural network that we train to identify short period variables. To make a prediction for a given light curve, our network requires no prior target parameters identified using other methods. Our network performs inference on a TESS 30-minute cadence light curve in ~5ms on a single GPU, enabling large scale archival searches. We present a collection of 14156 short-period variables identified by our network. The majority of our identified variables fall into two prominent populations, one of short-period main sequence binaries and another of Delta Scuti stars. Our neural network model and related code is additionally provided as open-source code for public use and extension.
