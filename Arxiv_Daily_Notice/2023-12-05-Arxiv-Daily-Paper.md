#### Do Mini-halos Affect Cosmic Reionization?

 - **Abstract**
 The role of unresolved structures ("mini-halos") in determining the consumption of ionizing photons during cosmic reionization remains an unsolved problem in modeling cosmic reionization, despite recent extensive studies with small-box high-resolution simulations by Park et al. and Chan et al., because the small-box studies are not able to fully sample all environments. In this paper these simulations are combined with large-box simulations from the "Cosmic Reionization On Computers" (CROC) project, allowing one to account for the full range of environments and to produce an estimate for the number of recombinations per hydrogen atom that are missed in large-scale simulations like CROC or Thesan. I find that recombinations in unresolved mini-halos are completely negligible compared to recombinations produced in large-scale cosmic structures and inside more massive, fully resolved halos. Since both Park et al. and Chan et al. studies have severe limitations, the conclusions of this paper may need to be verified with more representative sets of small-box high-resolution simulations.
#### Microlensing of strongly lensed quasars

 - **Abstract**
 Strong gravitational lensing of quasars has the potential to unlock the poorly understood physics of these fascinating objects, as well as serve as a probe of the lensing mass distribution and of cosmological parameters. In particular, gravitational microlensing by compact bodies in the lensing galaxy can enable mapping of quasar structure to $\lt 10^{-6}$ arcsec scales. Some of this potential has been realized over the past few decades, however the upcoming era of large sky surveys promises to bring this to full fruition. Here we review the theoretical framework of this field, describe the prominent current methods for parameter inference from quasar microlensing data across different observing modalities, and discuss the constraints so far derived on the geometry and physics of quasar inner structure. We also review the application of strong lensing and microlensing to constraining the granularity of the lens potential, i.e. the contribution of the baryonic and dark matter components, and the local mass distribution in the lens, i.e. the stellar mass function. Finally, we discuss the future of the field, including the new possibilities that will be opened by the next generation of large surveys and by new analysis methods now being developed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new spatially resolved astrometry and photometry of the CD-27 11535 system, a member of the $\beta$ Pictoris moving group consisting of two resolved K-type stars on a $\sim$20-year orbit. We fit an orbit to relative astrometry measured from NIRC2, GPI, and archival NaCo images, in addition to literature measurements. However, the total mass inferred from this orbit is significantly discrepant from that inferred from stellar evolutionary models using the luminosity of the two stars. We explore two hypotheses that could explain this discrepant mass sum; a discrepant parallax measurement from Gaia due to variability, and the presence of an additional unresolved companion to one of the two components. We find that the $\sim$20-year orbit could not bias the parallax measurement, but that variability of the components could produce a large amplitude astrometric motion, an effect which cannot be quantified exactly without the individual Gaia measurements. The discrepancy could also be explained by an additional star in the system. We jointly fit the astrometric and photometric measurements of the system to test different binary and triple architectures for the system. Depending on the set of evolutionary models used, we find an improved goodness of fit for a triple system architecture that includes a low-mass ($M=0.177\pm0.055$\,$M_{\odot}$) companion to the primary star. Further studies of this system will be required in order to resolve this discrepancy, either by refining the parallax measurement with a more complex treatment of variability-induced astrometric motion, or by detecting a third companion.
#### Probing Correlations in the Binary Black Hole Population with Flexible  Models

 - **Abstract**
 The astrophysical formation channels of binary black hole systems predict correlations between their mass, spin, and redshift distributions, which can be probed with gravitational-wave observations. Population-level analysis of the latest LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog of binary black hole mergers has identified evidence for such correlations assuming linear evolution of the mean and width of the effective spin distribution as a function of the binary mass ratio and merger redshift. However, the complex astrophysical processes at play in compact binary formation do not necessarily predict linear relationships between the distributions of these parameters. In this work, we relax the assumption of linearity and instead search for correlations using a more flexible cubic spline model. Our results suggest a nonlinear correlation between the width of the effective spin distribution and redshift. We also show that the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaborations may find convincing Bayesian evidence for nonlinear correlations by the end of the fourth observing run, O4. This highlights the valuable role of flexible models in population analyses of compact-object binaries in the era of growing catalogs.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we introduce a novel data augmentation methodology based on Conditional Progressive Generative Adversarial Networks (CPGAN) to generate diverse black hole (BH) images, accounting for variations in spin and electron temperature prescriptions. These generated images are valuable resources for training deep learning algorithms to accurately estimate black hole parameters from observational data. Our model can generate BH images for any spin value within the range of [-1, 1], given an electron temperature distribution. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we employ a convolutional neural network to predict the BH spin using both the GRMHD images and the images generated by our proposed model. Our results demonstrate a significant performance improvement when training is conducted with the augmented dataset while testing is performed using GRMHD simulated data, as indicated by the high R2 score. Consequently, we propose that GANs can be employed as cost effective models for black hole image generation and reliably augment training datasets for other parameterization algorithms.
#### Observational Constraints on Extended Starobinsky and Weyl Gravity Model  of Inflation
 - **Authors:** Piyabut Burikham, Teeraparb Chantavat, Pongsapat Boonaom

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01010
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.01010
 - **Abstract**
 We present constraints on the extended Starobinsky and Weyl gravity model of inflation using updated available observational data. The data includes cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy measurements from Planck and BICEP/Keck 2018 (BK18), as well as large-scale structure data encompassing cosmic shear and galaxy autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions measurements from Dark Energy Survey (DES), baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from 6dF, MGS and BOSS, and distance measurements from supernovae type Ia from Pantheon+ samples. By introducing a single additional parameter, each model extends the Starobinsky model to encompass larger region of parameter space while remaining consistent with all observational data. Specifically for higher number of $e$-folding, these models extend viable range of tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) to very small value $r<0.001$ in contrast to the original $R^2$ Starobinsky model. In addition, our results continue to emphasize the tension in $H_0$ and $S_8$ between early-time CMB measurements and late-time large-scale structure observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The Tianlai cylinder pathfinder is a radio interferometer array to test 21 cm intensity mapping techniques in the post-reionization era. It works in passive drift scan mode to survey the sky visible in the northern hemisphere. To deal with the large instantaneous field of view and the spherical sky, we decompose the drift scan data into m-modes, which are linearly related to the sky intensity. The sky map is reconstructed by solving the linear interferometer equations. Due to incomplete uv coverage of the interferometer baselines, this inverse problem is usually ill-posed, and regularization method is needed for its solution. In this paper, we use simulation to investigate two frequently used regularization methods, the Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD), and the Tikhonov regularization techniques. Choosing the regularization parameter is very important for its application. We employ the generalized cross validation (GCV) method and the L-curve method to determine the optimal value. We compare the resulting maps obtained with the different regularization methods, and for the different parameters derived using the different criteria. While both methods can yield good maps for a range of regularization parameters, in the Tikhonov method the suppression of noisy modes are more gradually applied, produce more smooth maps which avoids some visual artefacts in the maps generated with the TSVD method.

 - **Abstract**
 Variability is a prominent observational feature of blazars. The high-energy radiation mechanism of jets has always been important but still unclear. In this work, we performed a detailed analysis using Fermi-LAT data across 15 years and obtained GeV light curve information for 78 TeV blazars detected by Fermi. We provided annual GeV fluxes and corresponding spectral indices for the 78 TeV blazars and thorough monthly GeV fluxes for a subsample of 41 bright blazars. Our results suggest a strong correlation between the ${\gamma}$-ray photon index and $\log L_{\rm \gamma}$ for the flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and high-energy-peaked BL Lacs (HBLs). 14 sources in our sample show significant GeV outbursts/flares above the relatively stable, low-flux light curve, with 6 of them showing a clear sharp peak profile in their 5-day binned light curves. We quantified the variability utilizing the fractional variability parameter $F_{\mathrm{var}}$, and found that the flux of the FSRQs showed significantly stronger variability than that of the BL Lacs. The 41 bright blazars in this work are best fit by a log-normal flux distribution. We checked the spectral behavior and found 11 out of the 14 sources show a 'bluer-when-brighter (BWB)' trend, suggesting this spectral behavior for these TeV blazars at the GeV band arises from the mechanism that the synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) process dominates the GeV emission. Our research offers a systematic analysis of the GeV variability properties of TeV blazars and serves as a helpful resource for further associated blazar studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The energy spectra of particles produced from dark matter (DM) annihilation or decay are one of the fundamental ingredients to calculate the predicted fluxes of cosmic rays and radiation searched for in indirect DM detection. We revisit the calculation of the source spectra for annihilating and decaying DM using the Vincia shower algorithm in Pythia to include QED and QCD final state radiation and diagrams for the Electroweak (EW) corrections with massive bosons, not present in the default Pythia shower model. We take into account the spin information of the particles during the entire EW shower and the off-shell contributions from massive gauge bosons. Furthermore, we perform a dedicated tuning of the Vincia and Pythia parameters to LEP data on the production of pions, photons, and hyperons at the $Z$ resonance and discuss the underlying uncertainties. To enable the use of our results in DM studies, we provide the tabulated source spectra for the most relevant cosmic messenger particles, namely antiprotons, positrons, $\gamma$ rays and the three neutrino flavors, for all the fermionic and bosonic channels and DM masses between 5 GeV and 100 TeV, on https://github.com/ajueid/CosmiXs.git.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effects of halo kinematics on the dynamics of stellar discs by simulating the evolution of isolated disc-halo systems from equilibrium initial conditions. Our main results come from four simulations where the initial disc is identical and the halo is either treated as a rigid potential or is live with isotropic orbits or orbits that preferentially rotate with or counter to the disc. We confirm previous results that bar formation is more vigorous in models with a live halo than a rigid one and is further enhanced when halo orbits preferentially rotate with the disc. We discuss two types of buckling events with different symmetries about the mid plane, one that occurs just as the bar is forming and the other well after the bar has been established. We also show that warps are most easily excited and maintained when the halo is counter-rotating with the disc, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Our most novel result is the discovery of a rotating halo instability, which causes the disc and halo cusp to spiral outward from the centre of mass of the system whether the halo rotates with the disc or counter to it and also occurs in a disc bulge halo system that does not form a bar. We provide a heuristic linear model that captures the essential dynamics of the instability.
#### OGLE-2019-BLG-1180Lb: Discovery of a Wide-orbit Jupiter-mass Planet  around a Late-type Star

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the discovery and analysis of the planetary microlensing event OGLE-2019-BLG-1180 with a planet-to-star mass ratio $q \sim 0.003$. The event OGLE-2019-BLG-1180 has unambiguous cusp-passing and caustic-crossing anomalies, which were caused by a wide planetary caustic with $s \simeq 2$, where $s$ is the star-planet separation in units of the angular Einstein radius $\theta_{E}$. Thanks to well-covered anomalies by the Korea Micorolensing Telescope Network (KMTNet), we measure both the angular Einstein radius and the microlens parallax in spite of a relatively short event timescale of $t_{E} = 28$ days. However, because of a weak constraint on the parallax, we conduct a Bayesian analysis to estimate the physical lens parameters. We find that the lens system is a super-Jupiter-mass planet of $M_{p} = 1.75^{+0.54}_{-0.51} M_{J}$ orbiting a late-type star of $M_{h}=0.55^{+0.27}_{-0.26} M_\odot$ at a distance of $D_{L} = 6.1^{+0.9}_{-1.3}$ kpc. The projected star-planet separation is $a_{\perp} = 5.19^{+0.90}_{-1.23}$ au, which means that the planet orbits at about four times the snow line of the host star. Considering the relative lens-source proper motion of $\mu_{rel} = 6$ mas/yr, the lens will be separated from the source by 60 mas in 2029. At that time one can measure the lens flux from adaptive optics imaging of Kec or a next-generation 30 m class telescope. OGLE-2019-BLG-1180Lb represents a growing population of wide-orbit planets detected by KMTNet, so we also present a general investigation into prospects for further expanding the sample of such planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Complex organic molecules (COMs) in protoplanetary disks are key to understanding the origin of volatiles in comets in our solar system, yet the chemistry of COMs in protoplanetary disks remains poorly understood. Here we present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 3 observations of the disk around the young outbursting star V883 Ori, where the COMs sublimate from ices and are thus observable thanks to the warm condition of the disk. We have robustly identified ten oxygen-bearing COMs including $^{13}$C-isotopologues in the disk-integrated spectra. The radial distributions of the COM emission, revealed by the detailed analyses of the line profiles, show the inner emission cavity, similar to the previous observations in Band 6 and Band 7. We found that the COMs abundance ratios with respect to methanol are significantly higher than those in the warm protostellar envelopes of IRAS 16293-2422 and similar to the ratios in the solar system comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, suggesting the efficient (re-)formation of COMs in protoplanetary disks. We also constrained the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C and D/H ratios of COMs in protoplanetary disks for the first time. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of acetaldehyde, methyl formate, and dimethyl ether are consistently lower ($\sim$ 20-30) than the canonical ratio in the interstellar medium ($\sim$ 69), indicating the efficient $^{13}$C-fractionation of CO. The D/H ratios of methyl formate are slightly lower than the values in IRAS 16293-2422, possibly pointing to the destruction and reformation of COMs in disks. We also discuss the implications for nitrogen and sulfur chemistry in protoplanetary disks.
#### Observational Evidence of a Centi-parsec Supermassive Black Hole Binary  Existing in the Nearby Galaxy M81

 - **Abstract**
 Studying a centi-parsec supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) would allow us to explore a new parameter space in active galactic nuclei, and these objects are also potential sources of gravitational waves. We report evidence that an SMBHB with an orbital period of about 30 yr may be resident in the nearby galactic nucleus M81. This orbital period and the known mass of M81 imply an orbital separation of about 0.02 pc. The jet emanating from the primary black hole showed a short period of jet wobbling at about 16.7 yr, superposing a long-term precession at a timescale of several hundred years. Periodic radio and X-ray outbursts were also found two times per orbital period, which could be explained by a double-peaked mass accretion rate variation per binary orbit. If confirmed, M81 would be one of the closest SMBHB candidates, providing a rare opportunity to study the final parsec problem.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) In this paper, we present a project of multi-channel wide-field optical sky monitoring system with high temporal resolution -- Small Aperture Imaging Network Telescope (SAINT) -- mostly built from off-the-shelf components and aimed towards searching and studying optical transient phenomena on the shortest time scales. The instrument consists of 12 channels each containing 30cm (F/1.5) objectives mounted on separate mounts with pointing speeds up to 50deg/s. Each channel is equipped with a 4128x4104 pixel, and a set of photometric $griz$ filters and linear polarizers. At the heart of every channel is a custom built reducer-collimator module allowing rapid switching of an effective focal length of the telescope -- due to it the system is capable to operate in either wide-field survey or narrow-field follow-up modes. In the first case, the field of view of the instrument is 470 square degrees and the detection limits (5$\sigma$ level at 5500$\AA$) are 12.5-21 mag for exposure times of 20 ms - 20 min correspondingly. In the second, follow-up regime, all telescopes are oriented towards the single target, and SAINT becomes an equivalent to a 1m telescope, with the field of view reduced to 11$'$ x 11$'$, and the exposure times decreased down to 0.6 ms. Different channels may then have different filters installed, thus allowing a detailed study -- acquiring both color and polarization information -- of a target object with highest possible temporal resolution. The operation of SAINT will allow acquiring an unprecedented amount of data on various classes of astrophysical phenomena, from near-Earth to extragalactic ones, while its multi-channel design and the use of commercially available components allows easy expansion of its scale, and thus performance and detection capabilities.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discoveries of two giant planets orbiting the red giant branch (RGB) star HD 112570 and the red clump (RC) star HD 154391, based on the radial velocity (RV) measurements from Xinglong station and Okayama Astrophysical Observatory (OAO). Spectroscopic and asteroseismic analyses suggest that HD 112570 has a mass of $1.15\pm0.12\,M_{\odot}$, a radius of $9.85\pm0.23\,R_{\odot}$, a metallicity [Fe/H] of $-0.46\pm0.1$ and a ${\rm log}\,g$ of $2.47\pm0.1$. With the joint analysis of RV and Hipparcos-Gaia astrometry, we obtain a dynamical mass of $M_{\rm p}={3.42}_{-0.84}^{+1.4}\ M_{\rm Jup}$, a period of $P={2615}_{-77}^{+85}$ days and a moderate eccentricity of $e={0.20}_{-0.14}^{+0.16}$ for the Jovian planet HD 112570 b. For HD 154391, it has a mass of $2.07\pm0.03\,M_{\odot}$, a radius of $8.56\pm0.05\,R_{\odot}$, a metallicity [Fe/H] of $0.07\pm0.1$ and a ${\rm log}\,g$ of $2.86\pm0.1$. The super-Jupiter HD 154391 b has a mass of $M_{\rm p}={9.1}_{-1.9}^{+2.8}\ M_{\rm Jup}$, a period of $P={5163}_{-57}^{+60}$ days and an eccentricity of $e={0.20}_{-0.04}^{+0.04}$. We found HD 154391 b has one of the longest orbital period among those ever discovered orbiting evolved stars, which may provide a valuable case in our understanding of planetary formation at wider orbits. Moreover, while a mass gap at $4\,M_{\rm Jup}$ seems to be present in the population of giant stars, there appears to be no significant differences in the distribution of metallicity among giant planets with masses above or below this threshold. Finally, The origin of the abnormal accumulation near 2 au for planets around large evolved stars ($R_{\star}>21\,R_{\odot}$), remains unclear.

 - **Abstract**
 This study explores the impact of cosmic curvature on structure formation through general relativistic first-order perturbation theory, focusing on scalar fluctuations and excluding anisotropic stress sources. We analyze continuity and Euler equations, incorporating cosmic curvature into Einstein equations. Emphasizing late-time dynamics, we investigate matter density contrast evolution in the presence of cosmic curvature and dark energy perturbations, with a specific focus on sub-Hubble scales. Solving the evolution equation, we conduct data analysis using cosmic chronometers, baryon acoustic oscillations, type Ia supernova observations, and $f\sigma_8$ data. While constraints on certain parameters remain consistent, excluding cosmic curvature tightens constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m0}$ and $\sigma_{\rm 80}$ in $\Lambda$CDM and wCDM models. Intriguingly, the non-phantom behavior of dark energy proves more favorable in both wCDM and CPL models across diverse data combinations.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the interaction between early dark energy (EDE) and cold dark matter, proposing a Yukawa-coupled dark sector model to mitigate cosmological tensions. We utilize the EDE component in the coupled model to relieve the Hubble tension, while leveraging the interaction between dark matter and dark energy to alleviate the large-scale structure tension. The interaction takes the form of Yukawa coupling, which describes the coupling between scalar field and fermion field. We employed various cosmological datasets, including cosmic microwave background radiation, baryon acoustic oscillations, Type Ia supernovae, the local distance-ladder data (SH0ES), and the Dark Energy Survey Year-3 data, to analyze our novel model. Using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, our findings reveal that the constrained value of $H_0$ obtained from our new model at a 68\% confidence level is $72.21^{+0.82}_{-0.69}$ km/s/Mpc, effectively resolving the Hubble tension. Similar to the EDE model, the coupled model yields the $S_8$ value that still surpasses the result of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Nevertheless, the best-fit value of $S_8$ obtained from our new model is 0.817, which is lower than the EDE model's result of 0.8316. Consequently, although our model fails to fully resolve the large-scale structure tension, it mitigates the adverse effect of the original EDE model.

 Inflationary and bouncing scenarios are two frameworks that provide the mechanism to overcome the horizon problem as well as generate the primordial perturbations. In this work, we investigate the conservation of perturbations in single-field models of both inflationary and bouncing scenarios, where the quantity, $z = a \, \rm d \phi/{\rm d}\log a$, with $a$ representing the scale factor and $\phi$ denoting the scalar field, decreases with time. We observe that this behaviour occurs during the ultra-slow-roll phase in the context of inflation and the contracting phase in the context of bounce. We show that the conjugate momentum associated with the comoving curvature perturbation during both the ultra-slow-roll phase and the contracting phase of bouncing scenarios is conserved in the super-Hubble limit. We illustrate that, within the framework of inflation, this conservation of momentum allows for the evolution of perturbations across the ultra-slow-roll phase, enabling the calculation of the power spectrum for modes that exit the Hubble radius before the ultra-slow-roll phase begins. Similarly, in the context of a bounce, we can determine the power spectrum after the bounce using this method. We support our approach with both numerical and analytical arguments.

 - **Abstract**
 The TeV observations of GRB~221009A provided us with a unique opportunity to analyze the contemporaneous phase in which both prompt and afterglow emissions are seen simultaneously. To describe this initial phase of Gamma-Ray Burst afterglows, we suggest a model for a blast wave with an intermittent energy supply. We treat the blast wave as a two-element structure. The central engine supplies energy to the inner part (shocked ejecta material) via the reverse shock. As the shocked ejecta material expands, its internal energy is transferred to the shocked external matter. We take into account the inertia of the shocked external material so that the pressure difference across this region determines the derivative of the blast wave's Lorentz factor. Applied to GRB~221009A, the model yields a very good fit to the observations of the entire TeV lightcurve except for three regions where there are excesses in the data with respect to the model. Those are well correlated with the three largest episodes of the prompt activity, and thus, we interpret them as the reverse shock emission. Our best-fit solution for GRB~221009A is an extremely narrow jet with an opening angle theta_j approx 0.07^o (500/\Gamma_0) propagating into a wind-like external medium. This extremely narrow angle is consistent with the huge isotropic equivalent energy of this burst, and its inverse jet break explains the very rapid rise of the afterglow. Interestingly, photon-photon annihilation doesn't play a decisive role in the best-fit model.

 - **Abstract**
 With almost 15 years of data taken by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi satellite we discovered an extended source of GeV emission in the region of the very-high-energy (TeV) source 1LHAASO J1945+2424. This TeV source is more extended than the LAT source. The spectrum of the GeV emission is hard (with a photon spectral index ~1.5) and connects smoothly with that of the TeV source, indicating a likely common origin. In order to explain the origin of the gamma rays we explore scenarios which are typically used for supernova remnants (SNRs) and pulsar wind nebulae (PWN). For an SNR with a single particle population, a leptonic particle distribution in the form of a broken power-law with a break energy of ~3.7 TeV explains the spectrum well, while in the hadronic scenario a simple power-law with a hard spectral index of ~1.64 is necessary. In the PWN scenario, reasonable parameters are obtained for a source age of 10 kyr and current pulsar spin-down luminosity of 1e34 erg/s.

 This study aims to improve the photometric calibration of astronomical photo plates. The Sonneberg Observatory's sky patrol was selected, comprising about 300,000 plates, and the digitization workflow is implemented using PyPlate. The challenge is to remove zero point offsets resulting from differences in color sensitivity in the photo plates' emulsion response. By utilizing the Gaia DR3 dataset and the GaiaXPy tool, we are able to obtain a consistent astrometric and photometric calibration of the Sonneberg plates and those of other archives such as APPLAUSE.

 - **Abstract**
 Consistent operation of adaptive optics (AO) systems requires the use of a wavefront sensor (WFS) with high sensitivity and low noise. The nonlinear curvature WFS (nlCWFS) has been shown both in simulations and lab experiments to be more sensitive than the industry-standard Shack-Hartmann WFS (SHWFS), but its noise characteristics have yet to be thoroughly explored. In this paper, we develop a spatial domain wavefront error budget for the nlCWFS that includes common sources of noise that introduce uncertainty into the reconstruction process (photon noise, finite bit depth, read noise, vibrations, non-common-path errors, servo lag, etc.). We find that the nlCWFS can out-perform the SHWFS in a variety of environmental conditions, and that the primary challenge involves overcoming speed limitations related to the wavefront reconstructor. The results of this work may be used to inform the design of nlCWFS systems for a broad range of AO applications.
#### The impact of varying inhomogeneous reionization histories on metrics of  Ly$α$ opacity

 - **Abstract**
 The epoch of hydrogen reionization is complete by $z=5$, but its progression at higher redshifts is uncertain. Measurements of Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity show large scatter at $z<6$, suggestive of spatial fluctuations in neutral fraction ($x_\mathrm{HI}$), temperature, or ionizing background, either individually or in combination. However, these effects are degenerate, necessitating modeling these physics in tandem in order to properly interpret the observations. We begin this process by developing a framework for modeling the reionization history and associated temperature fluctuations, with the intention of incorporating ionizing background fluctuations at a later time. To do this, we generate several reionization histories using semi-numerical code AMBER, selecting histories with volume-weighted neutral fractions that adhere to the observed CMB optical depth and dark pixel fractions. Implementing these histories in the \texttt{Nyx} cosmological hydrodynamics code, we examine the evolution of gas within the simulation, and the associated metrics of the Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity. We find that the pressure smoothing scale within the IGM is strongly correlated with the adiabatic index of the temperature-density relation. We find that while models with 20,000 K photoheating at reionization are better able to reproduce the shape of the observed $z=5$ 1D flux power spectrum than those with 10,000 K, they fail to match the highest wavenumbers. The simulated autocorrelation function and optical depth distributions are systematically low and narrow, respectively, compared to the observed values, but are in better agreement when the reionization history is longer in duration, more symmetric in its distribution of reionization redshifts, or if there are remaining neutral regions at $z<6$. The systematically low variance likely requires the addition of a fluctuating UVB.

 - **Abstract**
 The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE, Wright et al. 2010) and its follow-up Near-Earth Object (NEO) mission (NEOWISE, Mainzer et al. 2011) scan the mid-infrared sky twice a year. The spatial and temporal coverage of the resulting database is of utmost importance for variability studies, in particular of young stellar objects (YSOs) which have red $W1{-}W2$ colors. During such an effort, I noticed subarcsecond position offsets between subsequent visits. The offsets do not appear for targets with small $W1{-}W2$ colors, which points to a chromatic origin in the optics, caused by the spacecraft pointing alternating ``forward'' and ``backward'' from one visit to another. It amounts to 0\farcs1 for targets with $W1{-}W2\approx2$. Consideration of this chromatic offset will improve astrometry. This is of particular importance for NEOs that are generally red.

 - **Abstract**
 A total of 64 ATOMS sources at different evolutionary stages were selected to investigate the kinematics and dynamics of gas structures under feedback. We identified dense gas structures based on the integrated intensity map of H$^{13}$CO$^+$ J=1-0 emission, and then extracted the average spectra of all structures to investigate their velocity components and gas kinematics. For the scaling relations between velocity dispersion $\sigma$, effective radius $R$ and column density $N$ of all structures, $\sigma-N*R$ always has a stronger correlation compared to $\sigma-N$ and $\sigma-R$. There are significant correlations between velocity dispersion and column density, which may imply that the velocity dispersion originates from gravitational collapse, also revealed by the velocity gradients. The measured velocity gradients for dense gas structures in early-stage sources and late-stage sources are comparable, indicating gravitational collapse through all evolutionary stages. We quantitatively estimated the velocity dispersion generated by the outflows, inflows, ionized gas pressure and radiation pressure, and found that the ionized gas feedback is stronger than other feedback mechanisms. However, although feedback from HII regions is the strongest, it does not significantly affect the physical properties of the embedded dense gas structures. Combining with the conclusions in Zhou+2023 on cloud-clump scales, we suggest that although feedback from cloud to core scales will break up the original cloud complex, the substructures of the original complex can be reorganized into new gravitationally governed configurations around new gravitational centers. This process is accompanied by structural destruction and generation, and changes in gravitational centers, but gravitational collapse is always ongoing.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are massive solar eruptions, which have a significant impact on Earth. In this paper, we propose a new method, called DeepCME, to estimate two properties of CMEs, namely, CME mass and kinetic energy. Being able to estimate these properties helps better understand CME dynamics. Our study is based on the CME catalog maintained at the Coordinated Data Analysis Workshops (CDAW) Data Center, which contains all CMEs manually identified since 1996 using the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). We use LASCO C2 data in the period between January 1996 and December 2020 to train, validate and test DeepCME through 10-fold cross validation. The DeepCME method is a fusion of three deep learning models, including ResNet, InceptionNet, and InceptionResNet. Our fusion model extracts features from LASCO C2 images, effectively combining the learning capabilities of the three component models to jointly estimate the mass and kinetic energy of CMEs. Experimental results show that the fusion model yields a mean relative error (MRE) of 0.013 (0.009, respectively) compared to the MRE of 0.019 (0.017, respectively) of the best component model InceptionResNet (InceptionNet, respectively) in estimating the CME mass (kinetic energy, respectively). To our knowledge, this is the first time that deep learning has been used for CME mass and kinetic energy estimations.
#### X-Ray Polarization Variability of High Spectral Peak BL Lacertaes: Cases  of 1ES 1959+650 and PKS 2155-304

 - **Abstract**
 By analyzing the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observational data, we report that the significant X-ray polarization variability is detected for 1ES 1959+650 and we also find the highest X-ray polarization so far in PKS 2155-304. The X-ray emission in 2-8 keV band of the high-energy peaked BL Lacertae objects (HBLs) is generally ascribed to the synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons, and thus HBLs are also the main targets of IXPE to investigate the radiation and acceleration mechanisms of particles. In this paper, we report the first IXPE observations of two HBLs. Two times out of four IXPE observations for 1ES 1959+650 detect the significant polarization in 2-8 keV band, and one more in 2-4 keV band. The detected highest polarization degree is 12.4% with an electric vector polarization angle 19.7 degrees in 2-8 keV band. The X-ray polarization of 1ES 1959+650 exhibits the obvious variability, and is accompanied by the variations of polarization angle, flux, and spectrum. For PKS 2155-304, only one observation was performed by IXPE, at which point the X-ray flux of source is almost the historically low state. Interestingly, the detected highest X-ray polarization among blazars is measured in PKS 2155-304. We also find that the obvious variability along with the spectral variation is presented in the simultaneously monitoring Swift-XRT data of PKS 2155-304. We speculate that the dominant X-ray radiations during different IXPE observations are from separate regions in jets and the dominant acceleration mechanism of particles may be also different.

 - **Abstract**
 We present, for the first time, a detailed abundance analysis of the carbon star HE 1104$-$0957 based on high resolution (R${\sim}$ 50\,000) spectra. Our analysis shows that the object is an extremely metal-poor star with [Fe/H] $\sim$ $-$2.96. We find that the object shows enhancement of carbon with [C/Fe] $\sim$ 1.82. However, it does not fall into any of the sub-groups of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars based on the characteristic elemental abundance ratios used for the classification of various CEMP sub-groups. HE 1104$-$0957 is also found to exhibit an enhancement of oxygen and nitrogen with [O/Fe], and [N/Fe] $\sim$ 1.54, and 2.54 respectively. In HE 1104$-$0957, $\alpha$-elements are found to be slightly enhanced with [$\alpha$/Fe] $\sim$ 0.46. Fe-peak elements are also moderately enhanced in HE 1104$-$0957 with a value 0.63 with respect to Fe. Our analysis shows that HE 1104$-$0957 exhibits enhancement of neutron-capture elements, particularly r-process elements. The low-resolution spectra of this object shows the spectral features characteristics of a typical C-R star. However, We find that the surface chemical compositions of this object is contradictory to that expected for a C-R star. It requires a detailed analysis to better understand the abundance anomalies exhibited by this object.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations from several pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have unveiled compelling evidence for a stochastic signal in the nanohertz band. This signal aligns remarkably with a gravitational wave (GW) background, potentially originating from the first-order color charge confinement phase transition. Distinct quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matters, such as quarks or gluons, and diverse phase transition processes thereof can yield disparate GW energy density spectra. In this letter, employing the Bayesian analysis on the NANOGrav 15-year data set, we explore the compatibility with the observed PTA signal of the GW from phase transitions of various QCD matter scenarios in the framework of the holographic QCD. We find that the PTA signal can be effectively explained by the GW from the confinement-deconfinement phase transition of pure quark systems in a hard wall model of the holographic QCD where the bubble dynamics, one important source of the GWs, is of the Jouguet detonations. Notably, our analysis decisively rules out the plausibility of the pure gluon QCD-matter scenario and the non-runaway bubble dynamics model for the phase transition in explaining the observed PTA signal.
#### UV-photoprocessing of acetic acid (CH3COOH)-bearing interstellar ice  analogs

 - **Abstract**
 Acetic acid (CH3COOH) was detected in the gas toward interstellar clouds, hot cores, protostars and comets. Its formation in ice mantles was proposed and acetic acid awaits detection in the infrared spectra of the ice as most other COMs except methanol. The thermal annealing and UV-irradiation of acetic acid in the ice was simulated experimentally in this work under astrophysically relevant conditions. The experiments were performed under ultra-high vacuum conditions. An ice layer was formed by vapor deposition onto a cold substrate, and was warmed up or exposed to UV photons. The ice was monitored by infrared spectroscopy while the molecules desorbing to the gas phase were measured using a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The transformation of the CH3COOH monomers to cyclic dimers occurs at 120 K and the crystal form composed of chain polymers was observed above 160 K during warm-up of the ice. Ice sublimation proceeds at 189 K in our experiments. Upon UV-irradiation simpler species and radicals are formed, which lead to a residue made of complex molecules after warm-up to room temperature. The possible formation of oxalic acid needs to be confirmed. The photodestruction of acetic acid molecules is reduced when mixed with water in the ice. This work may serve to search for the acetic acid photoproducts in lines of sight where this species is detected. A comparison of the reported laboratory infrared spectra with current JWST observations allows to detect or set upper imits on the CH3COOH abundances in interstellar and circumstellar ice mantles.
#### Surviving the Heat: multi-wavelength analysis of V883 Ori reveals that  dust aggregates survive the sublimation of their ice mantles

 - **Abstract**
 Investigating the response of icy dust aggregates to water ice sublimation is essential for understanding the formation and properties of planetesimals in protoplanetary discs. However, their fate remains unclear, as previous studies suggest aggregates could either survive or completely fall apart to (sub){\mu}m-sized grains. Protoplanetary discs around stars undergoing accretion outbursts represent a unique laboratory to study the ice sublimation process, as the water snowline is pushed outward to regions accessible to current observatories. In this work, we aim to understand the aggregates' response to ice sublimation by focusing on V883 Ori, a system currently undergoing a powerful accretion outburst. We present new analysis of archival high resolution ALMA observations of the protoplanetary disc of V883 Ori at 0.88, 1.3, 2.0, and 3.1 mm, and derive new radial spectral index profiles, which we compare with predictions from one-dimensional dust evolution simulations. In the region of V883 Ori where water ice has sublimated, we find lower spectral indices than previously obtained, indicating the presence of cm-sized particles. Coupled with our dust evolution models, we find that the only way to explain their presence is to assume they formed before the outburst, and survived the sublimation process. The resilience of dust aggregates to such intense events leads us to speculate that it may extend to other environments with more gentle heating, such as pebbles drifting through the water snowline in quiescent protoplanetary discs. In that case, it may alter the formation pathway of dry planetesimals interior to the snowline.

 - **Abstract**
 High-precision pulsar timing observations are limited in their accuracy by the jitter noise that appears in the arrival time of pulses. Therefore, it is important to systematically characterise the amplitude of the jitter noise and its variation with frequency. In this paper, we provide jitter measurements from low-frequency wideband observations of PSR J0437$-$4715 using data obtained as part of the Indian Pulsar Timing Array experiment. We were able to detect jitter in both the 300 - 500 MHz and 1260 - 1460 MHz observations of the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). The former is the first jitter measurement for this pulsar below 700 MHz, and the latter is in good agreement with results from previous studies. In addition, at 300 - 500 MHz, we investigated the frequency dependence of the jitter by calculating the jitter for each sub-banded arrival time of pulses. We found that the jitter amplitude increases with frequency. This trend is opposite as compared to previous studies, indicating that there is a turnover at intermediate frequencies. It will be possible to investigate this in more detail with uGMRT observations at 550 - 750 MHz and future high sensitive wideband observations from next generation telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array. We also explored the effect of jitter on the high precision dispersion measure (DM) measurements derived from short duration observations. We find that even though the DM precision will be better at lower frequencies due to the smaller amplitude of jitter noise, it will limit the DM precision for high signal-to-noise observations, which are of short durations. This limitation can be overcome by integrating for a long enough duration optimised for a given pulsar.

 - **Abstract**
 Future observations with next-generation large-area radio telescopes are expected to discover radio pulsars (PSRs) closely orbiting around Sagittarius~A* (Sgr~A*), the supermassive black hole (SMBH) dwelling at our Galactic Center (GC). Such a system can provide a unique laboratory for testing General Relativity (GR), as well as the astrophysics around the GC. In this paper, we provide a numerical timing model for PSR-SMBH systems based on the post-Newtonian (PN) equation of motion, and use it to explore the prospects of measuring the black hole (BH) properties with pulsar timing. We further consider the perturbation caused by the dark matter (DM) distribution around Sgr~A*, and the possibility of constraining DM models with PSR-SMBH systems. Assuming a 5-year observation of a normal pulsar in an eccentric ($e=0.8$) orbit with an orbital period $P_b = 0.5\,$yr, we find that -- with weekly recorded times of arrival (TOAs) and a timing precision of 1 ms -- the power-law index of DM density distribution near the GC can be constrained to about 20%. Such a measurement is comparable to those measurements at the Galactic length scale but can reveal small-scale properties of the DM.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on radio timing observations of PSR J0210+5845 which reveal large deviations from typical pulsar spin-down behaviour. We interpret these deviations as being due to binary motion around the $V=13.5$ star 2MASS J02105640$+$5845176, which is coincident in celestial position and distance with the pulsar. Archival observations and new optical spectroscopy identify this star as a B6V star with a temperature of $T_\mathrm{eff}\approx 14\,000$K and a mass of $M_\mathrm{c}= 3.5$ to $3.8$M$_\odot$, making it the lowest mass main-sequence star known orbiting a non-recycled pulsar. We found that the timing observations constrain the binary orbit to be wide and moderately eccentric, with an orbital period of $P_\mathrm{b}=47^{+40}_{-14}$yr and eccentricity $e=0.46^{+0.10}_{-0.07}$. We predict that the next periastron passage will occur between 2030 and 2034. Due to the low companion mass, we find that the probability for a system with the properties of PSR J0210+5845 and its binary companion to survive the supernova is low. We show that a low velocity and fortuitously directed natal kick is required for the binary to remain bound during the supernova explosion, and argue that an electron-capture supernova is a plausible formation scenario for the pulsar.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study we investigated the interiors of rocky exoplanets in order to identify those that may have large quantities of water. We modelled the interiors of 28 rocky exoplanets, assuming four different layers - an iron core, a rock mantle, a high-pressure ice layer, and a surface ice/water layer. Due to observational bias, our study is limited to habitable zone exoplanets. We determined a range of possible water mass fractions for each planet consistent with the modelled planetary structures. We calculated the tidal heating experienced by these exoplanets through gravitational interactions with their host stars, assuming a temperature- and composition dependent Maxwell viscoelastic rheology. Assuming radioactive elemental abundances observed in Solar System meteorites, we also calculated the radiogenic heat flux inside the planets. We estimated the probability of the presence of a thick ocean layer in these planets, taking into account the effect of both tidal and radiogenic heating. Our results showed that Proxima Centauri b, Ross 128 b, Teegarden's b and c, GJ 1061 c and d, and TRAPPIST-1 e may have an extended liquid water reservoir. Furthermore, extremely high H2O-content of the exoplanets Kepler-62 f, Kepler-1652 b, Kepler-452 b, and Kepler-442 b suggests that these planets may maintain a water vapour atmosphere and may in fact be examples of larger ocean worlds. Upon the discovery of new rocky exoplanets beyond the habitable zone, our study can be extended to icy worlds.

 The ESA space mission Euclid was launched on July 1st, 2023 and is undergoing its science verification phase. In this invited review we show that Euclid means a before and an after for our understanding of ultra-cool dwarfs and substellar-mass objects and their connections with stars, exoplanets and the Milky Way. Euclid enables the study with unprecedented statistical significance a very large ensemble of ultracool dwarfs, the identification of new types of substellar objects, and the determination of the substellar binary fraction and the Initial Mass Function (IMF) in diverse galactic environments from the nearest stellar nurseries to the ancient relics of Galactic formation.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution cross-correlation methods are widely used to discover and to characterise atomic and molecular species in exoplanet atmospheres. The characteristic cross-correlation signal is typically represented as a function of the velocity of the system, and the semi-amplitude of the planet's orbit. We present Saltire, a fast and simple model that accurately reproduces the shape of such cross-correlation signals, allowing a direct fit to the data by using a minimum set of parameters. We show how to use this model on the detection of atmospheric CO in archival data of the hot Jupiter tau Bootis b, and how Saltire can be used to estimate the semi-amplitude and rest velocity of high brightness-ratio binaries. By including the shape of the signal, we demonstrate that our model allows to robustly derive the signal position up to 10 times more accurate, compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of correlated noise and demonstrate that Saltire is a robust tool for estimating systematic uncertainties on the signal position. Saltire opens a new door to analyse high signal-to-noise data to accurately study atmospheric dynamics and to measure precise dynamical masses for exoplanets and faint stellar companions. We show, that the phase-resolved shape of the atmospheric CCF signal can accurately be reproduced, allowing studies of phase-dependent signal changes and to disentangle them from noise and data aliases.

 - **Abstract**
 The early solar system contained short-lived radionuclides such as $^{26}$Al (its half-life time $t_{1/2} = 0.7$ Myr), and many hypotheses have been proposed for their origin. One of the possible hypotheses is that when the protoplanetary disk of the solar system had already formed, a very close $(<1\,\mathrm{pc})$ supernova (SN) injected radioactive material directly into the disk. Such a $^{26}$Al injection hypothesis has been tested so far with very limited setups for disk structure and supernova distance, and then by comparing disruption and injection conditions separately. We extend this problem to analytically investigate whether there are conditions under which the surviving disk radius can confine enough $^{26}$Al for planet formation while allowing some disk disruption. We also consider a variety of i) disk mass and structure, ii) $^{26}$Al yields from SNs, and iii) large dust mass fraction $\eta_\mathrm{d}$. We find that $^{26}$Al yields of SN are required as $\gtrsim 2.1\times10^{-3}M_\odot(\eta_\mathrm{d}/0.2)^{-1}$, which is difficult to reproduce given the diversity of ejected $^{26}$Al mass and large dust mass fractions from the supernovae. Furthermore, we find that even if the above conditions are met, the SN shock changes the disk temperature. Our results place a strong constraint on the 'disk injection scenario'; a scenario in which fresh $^{26}$Al of the early Solar System is injected from a supernova into an already formed protosolar nebula is quite challenging. Rather, we suggest that the fresh $^{26}$Al of the early solar system must have been synthesized/injected in other ways.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: We report the discovery and analysis of a periodic methanol maser in the massive protostar IRAS 20216+4104. Methods: To obtain the light curve, we used the 6.7 GHz methanol maser spectra collected between 2000-2003 and 2009-2023 with the Hartebeesthoek and Torun radio telescopes, as well as spectra from the literature reported prior to 1992. Results: The velocity-integrated flux density shows sinusoidal-like variations with a period of 6.9 +/- 0.03 yr. All but one of the features show periodic changes with a relative amplitude of 2 up to >89. A slightly variable feature displays a moderate anti-correlation between the flux density and the other significantly variable features. The maser emission appears to follow the continuum emission of the red-shifted outflow cavity. A maximum emission of 3.4 and 4.6 mu m precedes the maser peak by 15 % of the period and the (infrared) IR light centroids show time-dependent displacement. The periodic behaviour of the maser and IR emission is likely due to the eclipsing effect from a wobbling inner disk.

 - **Abstract**
 We have targeted the dusty symbiotic mira system HM Sge with four instruments from the IR to the UV. We have used these observations along with archival observations to study how the system has been evolving after its 1975 nova-like outburst. We have detected ro-vibrational water emission in a symbiotic system for the first time using new EXES high spectral resolution infrared spectroscopy. The features, detected in emission, have velocities consistent with the systemic velocity but do not show any clear evidence of high velocity outflows. Mid-infrared photometry and grism spectroscopy show that the oxygen-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) dust and dust output has shown little to no change over the past 39 years. In the optical/UV, we detect three main [NII] nebular features that were detected 22 years ago. Two of these features show a small amount of movement corresponding to average outflows speeds of 38 kms and 78 kms since they were previously observed; some previously detected [NII] features are no longer visible. New UV spectroscopy has shown that the nebular environment continues to steadily relax after the system's 1975 outburst. The data suggest however, that the hot component has increased in temperature from 200,000 K in 1989 to now greater than 250,000 K. Our new and archival observations suggest that the evolution of the system after its outburst is swift with little to no major changes after a period of a couple years.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarisation is a powerful remote-sensing tool to study the nature of particles scattering the starlight. It is widely used to characterise interplanetary dust particles in the Solar System and increasingly employed to investigate extrasolar dust in debris discs' systems. We aim to measure the scattering properties of the dust from the debris ring around HD 181327 at near-infrared wavelengths. We obtained high-contrast polarimetric images of HD 181327 in the H band with the SPHERE / IRDIS instrument on the Very Large Telescope (ESO). We complemented them with archival data from HST / NICMOS in the F110W filter reprocessed in the context of the Archival Legacy Investigations of Circumstellar Environments (ALICE) project. We developed a combined forward-modelling framework to simultaneously retrieve the scattering phase function in polarisation and intensity. We detected the debris disc around HD 181327 in polarised light and total intensity. We measured the scattering phase function and the degree of linear polarisation of the dust at 1.6 micron in the birth ring. The maximum polarisation is 23.6% +/- 2.6% and occurs between a scattering angle of 70 deg and 82 deg. We show that compact spherical particles made of a highly refractive and relatively absorbing material in a differential power-law size distribution of exponent $-3.5$ can simultaneously reproduce the polarimetric and total intensity scattering properties of the dust. This type of material cannot be obtained with a mixture of silicates, amorphous carbon, water ice, and porosity, and requires a more refracting component such as iron-bearing minerals. We reveal a striking analogy between the near-infrared polarisation of comets and that of HD 181327. The methodology developed here combining VLT/SPHERE and HST/NICMOS may be applicable in the future to combine the polarimetric capabilities of SPHERE with the sensitivity of JWST.
#### The Carbon-to-Oxygen Ratio in Cool Brown Dwarfs and Giant Exoplanets. I.  The Benchmark Late-T dwarfs GJ 570D, HD 3651B and Ross 458C

 - **Abstract**
 Measurements of the C/O ratio in brown dwarfs are lacking, in part due to past models adopting solar C/O only. We have expanded the ATMO 2020 atmosphere model grid to include non-solar metallicities and C/O ratios in the T dwarf regime. We change the C/O ratio by altering either the carbon or oxygen elemental abundances, and we find that non-solar abundances of these elements can be distinguished based on the shapes of the $H$- and $K$- bands. We compare these new models with medium-resolution ($R\approx1700$), near-infrared ($0.8-2.4\,\mu$m) Gemini/GNIRS spectra of three benchmark late-T dwarfs, GJ 570D, HD 3651B, and Ross 458C. We find solar C/O ratios and best-fitting parameters ($T_\mathrm{eff}$, $\log(g)$, $Z$) broadly consistent with other analyses in the literature based on low-resolution ($R\sim100$) data. The model-data discrepancies in the near-infrared spectra are consistent across all three objects. These discrepancies are alleviated when fitting the Y, J, H and K bands individually, but the resulting best-fit parameters are inconsistent and disagree with the results from the full-spectrum. By examining the model atmosphere properties we find this is due to the interplay of gravity and metallicity on $\mathrm{H_2-H_2}$ collisionally induced absorption. We therefore conclude that there are no significant issues with the molecular opacity tables used in the models at this spectral resolution. Instead, deficiencies are more likely to lie in the model assumptions regarding the thermal structures. Finally, we find a discrepancy between the GNIRS, SpeX, and other near-infrared spectra in the literature of Ross 458C, indicating potential spectroscopic variability.

 - **Abstract**
 Superbursts of neutron stars are rare but powerful events explained by the explosive burning of carbon in the deep layers of the outer envelope of the star. In this paper we perform a simulation of superbursts and propose a simple method for describing the neutrino stage of their cooling, as well as a method for describing the evolution of the burst energy on a scale of several months. We note a universal relation for the temperature distribution in the burnt layer at its neutrino cooling stage, as well as the unification of bolometric light curves and neutrino heat loss rates for deep and powerful bursts. We point out the possibility of long-term retention of the burst energy in the star's envelope. The results can be useful for interpretation of superburst observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We identify jet-shaped morphology in the core-collapse supernova remnant (SNR) CTB 1 that includes two opposite structural features. We identify these as the imprints of a pair of jets that were among the last jets to explode the massive stellar progenitor of CTB 1. We find the projected angle between the jets' axis and the direction of the pulsar velocity, which is the neutron star natal kick, to be 78 degrees. We tentatively identify possible signatures of a second pair of opposite jets along a different direction. If holds, SNR CTB 1 has a point-symmetric structure. The morphology and large angle of the jets' axis to kick velocity are the expectations of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of core-collapse supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a detailed analysis of quasinormal $f-$mode frequencies in neutron stars (NS), within the linearized General Relativistic formalism. From Bayesian inference, we derived approximately 9000 nuclear Equations of State (EOS) subject to various constraints including nuclear saturation properties, the pure neutron matter EOS constraint obtained within $\chi$EFT, and pQCD at densities relevant to NS cores. The composition and oscillatory dynamics of NS are then investigated using this set. The EOS are transformed into a spectral representation, aiding in the efficient computation of NS properties. The median frequency values of the $f-$mode for NS with masses ranging from 1.4$M_\odot$ to 2.0$M_{\odot}$ lie between 1.80 and 2.20 kHz for our entire EOS set. Our findings do not reveal a strong correlation between $f-$mode frequencies and individual nuclear saturation properties of the EOS. This suggests the need for more complex methods to unravel multiple-parameter relationships. We noticed a strong relationship between the radii and $f-$mode frequencies for different NS masses. Using this correlation along with NICER observations of PSR J0740+6620 and PSR 0030+0451, we obtained constraints that have minimal overlap in the radius domain and differ in the frequency domain from our entire nucleonic EOS set. This indicates that there may be a need to consider additional exotic particles or maybe a deconfined quark phase in the EOS relevant to the NS core. We argue that future observations of the radius or $f-$mode frequency for more than one NS mass, particularly at the extremes, are likely to settle the issue by either ruling out only nucleonic EOS or providing definitive evidence in its favour.

 - **Abstract**
 The latest improvements in the scale and calibration of Type Ia supernovae catalogues allow us to constrain the specific nature and evolution of dark energy through its effect on the expansion history of the universe. We present the results of Bayesian cosmological model comparison on the SNe~Ia catalogue Pantheon+, where Flat $\Lambda$CDM is preferred by the data over all other models and we find moderate evidence ($\Delta \log \mathcal{Z} \sim 2.5$) to reject a number of the alternate dark energy models. The effect of peculiar velocity corrections on model comparison is analysed, where we show that removing the peculiar velocity corrections results in a varying fit on non-$\Lambda$CDM parameters. As well as comparing cosmological models, the Bayesian methodology is extended to comparing the scatter model of the data, testing for non-gaussianity in the Pantheon+ Hubble residuals. We find that adding a scale parameter to the Pantheon+ covariances, or alternately using a multivariate Student's t-distribution fits the data better than the fiducial analysis, producing a cosmology independent evidence increase of $\Delta \log \mathcal{Z} = 2.29 $ and $2.46$ respectively. This improved treatment of the scatter decreases the uncertainty in the constraint on the Hubble constant, finding $H_0 = 73.67 \pm 0.99 $ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, in $ 5.7 \sigma$ tension with Planck. We also explore $M_B$ transition models as a potential solution for the Hubble tension, finding no evidence to support these models among the SNe data.
