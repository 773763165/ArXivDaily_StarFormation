 - **Abstract**
 We present a comparison of the Milky Way's star formation rate (SFR) surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) obtained with two independent state-of-the-art observational methods. The first method infers $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ from the observations of the dust thermal emission from interstellar dust grains in far infrared wavelengths registered in the Herschel Infrared Galactic Plane Survey (Hi-GAL), as presented in Elia et al. (2022). The second method obtains $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ by modeling the current population of O-, B-, and A-type stars in a 6 kpc $\times$ 6 kpc area around the Sun, as presented in Zari et al. (2023). We found an agreement between the two methods within a factor of two for the mean SFRs and the SFR surface density profiles. Given the broad differences between the observational techniques and the independent assumptions in the methods to compute the SFRs, this agreement constitutes a significant advance in our understanding of the star formation of our Galaxy and implies that the local SFR has been roughly constant over the past 10 Myr.

 - **Abstract**
 The dominant formation mechanism of brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects in star-forming regions is presently uncertain. Do they form like stars, via the collapse and fragmentation of cores in Giant Molecular clouds, or do they form like planets in the discs around stars and are ejected via dynamical interactions? In this paper, we quantify the spatial distribution of substellar objects in NGC1333, in particular focusing on planetary-mass objects that have been the target of recent deep imaging observations. We find that these objects have a spatial distribution that is indistinguishable from the stars, and more massive brown dwarfs. We also analyse N-body simulations and find that a population of ejected planets would have a significantly different spatial and kinematic distribution to stars, and brown dwarfs that also formed through gravitational collapse and fragmentation. We therefore conclude that the low-mass substellar objects in NGC1333 formed more like stars than planets, although we predict that a population of hitherto undetected ejected planetary mass objects may be lurking in this, and other star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Many post-processing algorithms have been developed in order to better separate the signal of a companion from the bright light of the host star, but the effect of such algorithms on the shape of exoplanet spectra extracted from integral field spectrograph data is poorly understood. The resulting spectra are affected by noise that is correlated in wavelength space due to both optical and data processing effects. Within the framework of Bayesian atmospheric retrievals, we aim to understand how these correlations and other systematic effects impact the inferred physical parameters. We consider three algorithms (KLIP, PynPoint and ANDROMEDA), optimizing the choice of algorithmic parameters using a series of injection tests into archival SPHERE and GPI data of the HR 8799 system. The wavelength-dependent covariance matrix is calculated to provide a measure of instrumental and algorithmic systematics. We perform atmospheric retrievals using petitRADTRANS on optimally extracted spectra to measure how these data processing systematics influence the retrieved parameter distributions. The choice of data processing algorithm and parameters significantly impact the accuracy of retrieval results, with the mean posterior parameter bias ranging from 1 to 3 $\sigma$ from the true input parameters. Including the full covariance matrix in the likelihood improves the accuracy of inferred parameters, and cannot be accounted for using ad hoc scaling parameters in the retrieval framework. Using the Bayesian information criterion and other statistical measures as a heuristic goodness-of-fit metrics, the retrievals including the full covariance matrix are favoured when compared to using only the diagonal elements.
#### Searching for outflows in X-ray weak quasars

 - **Abstract**
 The connection between X-ray weakness and powerful X-ray outflows is both expected in a scenario where outflows are connected with radiation-driven winds, and observed in several sources, both in the local Universe and at high redshift. Here I present the first results of a new study of this possible connection based on a search for SDSS quasars with weak X-ray emission in serendipitous XMM-Newton observations. The selected objects have a "normal" optical/UV blue continuum, but a flat and extraordinarily weak X-ray spectrum. The availability of rest-frame optical/UV spectra allows to check for the signature of outflows in the absorption lines and/or in the profiles of the emission lines. This method could reveal the presence of a population of so-far overlooked outflowing quasars and confirm the connection between winds and X-ray weakness in quasars.

 - **Abstract**
 Minimising the impact of stellar variability in Radial Velocity (RV) measurements is a critical challenge in achieving the 10 cm s$^{-1}$ precision needed to hunt for Earth twins. Since 2012, a dedicated programme has been underway with HARPS-N, to conduct a blind RV Rocky Planets Search (RPS) around bright stars in the Northern Hemisphere. Here we describe the results of a comprehensive search for planetary systems in two RPS targets, HD 166620 and HD 144579. Using wavelength-domain line-profile decorrelation vectors to mitigate the stellar activity and performing a deep search for planetary reflex motions using a trans-dimensional nested sampler, we found no significant planetary signals in the data sets of either of the stars. We validated the results via data-splitting and injection recovery tests. Additionally, we obtained the 95th percentile detection limits on the HARPS-N RVs. We found that the likelihood of finding a low-mass planet increases noticeably across a wide period range when the inherent stellar variability is corrected for using scalpels U-vectors. We are able to detect planet signals with $M\sin i \leq 1$ M$_\oplus$ for orbital periods shorter than 10 days. We demonstrate that with our decorrelation technique, we are able to detect signals as low as 54 cm s$^{-1}$, which brings us closer to the calibration limit of 50 cm s$^{-1}$ demonstrated by HARPS-N. Therefore, we show that we can push down towards the RV precision required to find Earth analogues using high-precision radial velocity data with novel data-analysis techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 This tutorial is an introduction to High-Contrast Imaging, a technique that enables astronomers to isolate light from faint planets and/or circumstellar disks that would otherwise be lost amidst the light of their host stars. Although technically challenging, high-contrast imaging allows for direct characterization of the properties of detected circumstellar sources. The intent of the article is to provide newcomers to the field a general overview of the terminology, observational considerations, data reduction strategies, and analysis techniques high-contrast imagers employ to identify, vet, and characterize planet and disk candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultraviolet spectra were taken of 25 Detached Eclipsing Binaries (DEBs) with spectral types O, B, and early A with the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) satellite in the 1150 to 1900 ${\AA}$ region. The spectra were compared with BOSZ model atmospheres (Bohlin, et al. 2017). The composite spectra of the DEBs were modeled by a combination of models representing the hot and cool components, and the temperatures of the hottest components of the systems were determined. From these temperatures a direct Mass-Temperature relation was obtained for stars close to the main sequence with solar metallicity for B and early A stars: log M/Msun = -5.90 $\pm$ 0.27 + (1.56 $\pm$ 0.07) x log T This relation allows a mass to be inferred for comparable stars from an ultraviolet spectrum. The five chemically peculiar Am stars in the sample have larger radii than normal A stars of the same mass.

 - **Abstract**
 We return to interpreting the historical SN~1987A neutrino data from a modern perspective. To this end, we construct a suite of spherically symmetric supernova models with the Prometheus-Vertex code, using four different equations of state and five choices of final baryonic neutron-star (NS) mass in the 1.36-1.93 M$_\odot$ range. Our models include muons and proto-neutron star (PNS) convection by a mixing-length approximation. The time-integrated signals of our 1.44 M$_\odot$ models agree reasonably well with the combined data of the four relevant experiments, IMB, Kam-II, BUST, and LSD, but the high-threshold IMB detector alone favors a NS mass of 1.7-1.8 M$_\odot$, whereas Kam-II alone prefers a mass around 1.4 M$_\odot$. The cumulative energy distributions in these two detectors are well matched by models for such NS masses, and the previous tension between predicted mean neutrino energies and the combined measurements is gone, with and without flavor swap. Generally, our predicted signals do not strongly depend on assumptions about flavor mixing, because the PNS flux spectra depend only weakly on antineutrino flavor. While our models show compatibility with the events detected during the first seconds, PNS convection and nucleon correlations in the neutrino opacities lead to short PNS cooling times of 5-9 s, in conflict with the late event bunches in Kam-II and BUST after 8-9 s, which are also difficult to explain by background. Speculative interpretations include the onset of fallback of transiently ejected material onto the NS, a late phase transition in the nuclear medium, e.g., from hadronic to quark matter, or other effects that add to the standard PNS cooling emission and either stretch the signal or provide a late source of energy. More research, including systematic 3D simulations, is needed to assess these open issues.
#### Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey of the Cygnus-X region  (PILS-Cygnus) -- The role of the external environment in setting the  chemistry of protostars

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Molecular lines are commonly detected towards protostellar sources. However, to get a better understanding of the chemistry of these sources we need unbiased molecular surveys over a wide frequency range for as many sources as possible to shed light on the origin of this chemistry, particularly any influence from the external environment. We present results from the PILS-Cygnus survey of ten intermediate- to high-mass protostellar sources in the nearby Cygnus-X complex, through high angular resolution interferometric observations over a wide frequency range. Using the Submillimeter Array (SMA), a spectral line survey of ten sources was performed in the frequency range 329-361 GHz, with an angular resolution of $\sim$1\farcs5, ($\sim$2000 AU, source distance of 1.3 kpc). Spectral modelling was performed to identify molecular emission and determine column densities and excitation temperatures for each source. We detect CH$_3$OH towards nine of the ten sources, CH$_3$OCH$_3$ and CH$_3$OCHO towards three sources, and CH$_3$CN towards four sources. Towards five sources the chemistry is spatially differentiated (different species peak at different positions and are offset from the peak continuum emission). The chemical properties of each source do not correlate with their position in the Cygnus-X complex, nor do the distance or direction to the nearest OB associations. However, the five sources located in the DR21 filament do appear to show less line emission compared to the five sources outside the filament. This work shows how important wide frequency coverage observations are combined with high angular resolution observations for studying the protostellar environment. Based on the ten sources observed here, the external environment appears to only play a minor role in setting the chemical environment on these small scales ($<$ 2000 AU).

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate optical characteristics of flashes caused by impacting meter- to decameter-sized outer solar system objects on Jupiter and contributions of reflected light from surface clouds at visible wavelengths to estimate more accurate bulk parameters such as the luminous energy of the flash, the kinetic energy, the mass, and the size of the impact object. Based on the results of recent reflectivity studies of the Jovian surface, we develop a cloud reflection model that calculates the contribution of the reflected light relative to that directly from the flash. We compare the apparent luminous energy of the previously reported flashes with the expected cloud reflection contributions to obtain their revised bulk parameters. We found that the cloud reflection contributions can be up to 200% of the flux directly from the flash and thus can be the most significant uncertainty in the measurement of the bulk parameters. The reflection contributions strongly depend on wavelength. With our cloud reflection correction, the revised bulk parameters of the previously reported flashes are obtained. Our cloud reflection correction provides a better understanding of the properties of impacting objects on Jupiter and is crucial for ongoing detailed investigations using high-sensitivity and multi-wavelength observation systems such as PONCOTS. It will also be useful for understanding other optical transients in Jupiter's upper atmosphere, such as the recently discovered sprite-like events.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery and characterisation of a giant transiting planet orbiting around a nearby M3.5V dwarf (d = 80.4 pc, G = 15.1 mag, K=11.2 mag, R$_\star$ = 0.354 $\pm$ 0.011 R$_\odot$, M$_\star$ = 0.3400 $\pm$ 0.0086 M$_\odot$). Using the photometric time series from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) sectors 10, 36, 46, and 63, and near-infrared spectrophotometry from ExTrA, we measured a planetary radius of 0.766 $\pm$ 0.026 R$_J$ and an orbital period of 1.52 days. With high-resolution spectroscopy taken by the CFHT/SPIRou and ESO/ESPRESSO spectrographs, we refined the host star parameters ([Fe/H] = 0.27 $\pm$ 0.12) and measured the mass of the planet (0.2729 $\pm$ 0.0058 M$_J$). Based on these measurements, TOI- 4860 b joins the small set of massive planets found around mid-to-late M dwarfs (< 0.4 R$_\odot$), providing both an interesting challenge to planet formation theory and a favourable target for further atmospheric studies with transmission spectroscopy. We identify an additional signal in the radial velocity data that we attribute to an eccentric (e = 0.657 $\pm$ 0.089) planet candidate with an orbital period of 426.9 $\pm$ 7.4 days and a minimum mass of 1.66 $\pm$ 0.26 M$_J$.

 - **Abstract**
 A mid-infrared nulling-space interferometer is a promising way to characterize thermal light from habitable planet candidates around Sun-like stars. However, one of the main challenges for achieving this ambitious goal is a high-precision stability of the optical path difference (OPD) and amplitude over a few days for planet detection and up to a few weeks for in-depth characterization. Here we propose a new method called phase-space synthesis decomposition (PSSD) to shorten the stability requirement to minutes, significantly relaxing the technological challenges of the mission. Focusing on what exactly modulates the planet signal in the presence of the stellar leak and systematic error, PSSD prioritizes the modulation of the signals along the wavelength domain rather than baseline rotation. Modulation along the wavelength domain allows us to extract source positions in parallel to the baseline vector for each exposure. The sum of the one-dimensional data converts into two-dimensional information. Based on the reconstructed image, we construct a continuous equation and extract the spectra through the singular value decomposition (SVD) while efficiently separating them from a long-term systematic stellar leak. We performed numerical simulations to investigate the feasibility of PSSD for the LIFE mission concept. We confirm that multiple terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around a Sun-like star at 10 pc can be detected and characterized despite high levels and long durations of systematic noise. We also find that PSSD is more robust against a sparse sampling of the array rotation compared to purely rotation-based signal extraction. Using PSSD as signal extraction method significantly relaxes the technical requirements on signal stability and further increases the feasibility of the LIFE mission.

#### Neutral atomic and molecular clouds and star formation in the outer  Carina arm

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive investigation of HI (super)clouds, molecular clouds (MCs), and star formation in the Carina spiral arm of the outer Galaxy. Utilizing HI4PI and CfA CO survey data, we identify HI clouds and MCs based on the ($l$, ${v_\mathrm{LSR}}$) locations of the Carina arm. We analyzed 26 HI clouds and 48 MCs. Most of the identified HI clouds are superclouds, with masses exceeding $10^6~{\mathrm{M_\odot}}$. We find that 15 of these superclouds have associated MC(s) with ${M_\mathrm{HI}} \gtrsim 10^6~{\mathrm{M_\odot}}$ and ${\Sigma_\mathrm{HI+H_2}} \gtrsim$ 50 ${\mathrm{M_\odot}} \rm pc^{-2}$. Our virial equilibrium analysis suggests that these CO-bright HI clouds are gravitationally bound or marginally bound. We report an anti-correlation between molecular mass fractions and Galactocentric distances, and a correlation with total gas surface densities. Nine CO-bright HI superclouds are associated with HII regions, indicating ongoing star formation. We confirm the regular spacing of HI superclouds along the spiral arm, which is likely due to some underlying physical process, such as gravitational instabilities. We observe a strong spatial correlation between HII regions and MCs, with some offsets between MCs and local HI column density peaks. Our study reveals that in the context of HI superclouds, the star formation rate surface density is independent of HI and total gas surface densities but positively correlates with molecular gas surface density. This finding is consistent with both extragalactic studies of the resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and local giant molecular clouds study of Lada et al. (2013), emphasizing the crucial role of molecular gas in regulating star formation processes.

 - **Abstract**
 A CALLISTO system was set up at the Arthur C Clarke Institute and connected to the e-CALLISTO global network which observes the solar radio bursts in 24 hours. CALLISTO is the foremost observation facility to investigate celestial objects in radio region in Sri Lanka. The system consists of the CALLISTO spectrometer and controlling software,logarithmic periodic antenna and pre-amplifier. CALLISTO spectrometer is able to detect solar radio bursts in the frequency range of 45 MHz to 870 MHz with a channel resolution of 62.5 kHz.The log-periodic antenna was designed for 7 dBi gain and achieved the voltage standing wave ratio, less than 1.5 which is acquired by the overall impedance of the antenna, 49.3 ohms. The linear polarized antenna is pointing to zenith and the dipoles directed to north-south direction. The system detects solar radio emissions originated by solar flares and corona mass ejections. The radio bursts occurs as emission stripes in the radio spectra and classify from type I to V mainly on drift rate and band width. The system observed a type III solar radio burst on 5th July 2013 and a type II burst on 25th October 2013 which was originated by X1.7 solar flare. The type II bursts characterize with narrow bandwidth and drift slowly from higher to lower frequencies while the main features of type III bursts are high drift rate and broad bandwidth.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate polarimetric calibration of the radio pulse profiles from pulsars is crucial for studying their radiation properties at these wavelengths. Inaccurate calibration can also distort recorded pulse profiles, introducing noise in time of arrival (TOA) data and thus degrading pulsar timing analyses. One method for determining the full polarimetric response of a given telescope is to conduct observations of bright polarized pulsars over wide ranges of parallactic angles, to sample different orientations of their polarization angle and determine the cross-couplings between polarization feeds. The Nan\c{c}ay decimetric Radio Telescope (NRT) is a 94m equivalent meridian telescope, capable of tracking a given pulsar for approximately one hour around transit. In November 2019, we began conducting regular observations of the bright and highly linearly polarized pulsar PSR~J0742$-$2822, in a special mode where the feed horn rotates by $\sim 180^\circ$ over the course of the one hour observation, mimicking wide parallactic angle variations and enabling us to determine the polarimetric response of the NRT at 1.4~GHz. The improved polarimetric response of the NRT as determined from these observations was applied to observations of a selection of MSPs with published polarimetric properties. We find that the new polarimetric profiles and polarization position angles are consistent with previous findings, unlike NRT polarimetric results obtained with the previously used method of calibration. The analysis of timing data on J1730$-$2304, J1744$-$1134, and J1857+0953 shows that the new calibration method improves the quality of the timing, and the Matrix Template Matching (MTM) method proves very effective at reducing noise from imperfect calibration. For pulsars with sufficient degrees of polarization, the MTM method appears to be the preferred method for extracting TOAs from NRT observations.
#### Beyond small-scale transients: a closer look at the diffuse quiet solar  corona

 - **Abstract**
 Within the quiet Sun corona imaged at 1 MK, much of the field of view consists of diffuse emission that appears to lack the spatial structuring that is so evident in coronal loops or bright points. We seek to determine if these diffuse regions are categorically different in terms of their intensity fluctuations and spatial configuration from the more well-studied dynamic coronal features. We analyze a time series of observations from Solar Orbiter's High Resolution Imager in the Extreme Ultraviolet to quantify the characterization of the diffuse corona at high spatial and temporal resolutions. We then compare this to the dynamic features within the field of view, mainly a coronal bright point. We find that the diffuse corona lacks visible structuring, such as small embedded loops, and that this is persistent over the 25 min duration of the observation. The intensity fluctuations of the diffuse corona, which are within +/-5%, are significantly smaller in comparison to the coronal bright point. Yet, the total intensity observed in the diffuse corona is of the same order as the bright point. It seems inconsistent with our data that the diffuse corona is a composition of small loops or jets or that it is driven by discrete small heating events that follow a power-law-like distribution. We speculate that small-scale processes like MHD turbulence might be energizing the diffuse regions, but at this point we cannot offer a conclusive explanation for the nature of this feature.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes, which could have formed during the early Universe through overdensities in primordial density fluctuations during inflation, are potential candidates for dark matter. We explore the use of lensing parallax of Gamma ray bursts, which results in different fluxes being observed from two different vantage points, in order to probe the abundance of primordial black holes in the unexplored window within the mass range $[10^{-15}-10^{-11}]M_\odot$. We derive the optical depth for the detectability of lensing of GRBs with a distribution of source properties and realistic detector sensitivities. We comment on the ability of the proposed Indian twin satellite mission Daksha in its low earth orbit to conduct this experiment. If the two Daksha satellites observe 10000 GRBs simultaneously and the entirety of dark matter is made up of $[10^{-15}-10^{-12}]M_\odot$ black holes, Daksha will detect non-zero lensing events with a probability ranging from [80, 50] per cent. Non-detections will not conclusively rule out primordial black holes as dark matter in this mass range. However, we show that meaningful constraints can be obtained in such a case if the two satellites are separated by at least the Earth-Moon distance.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the correlation between the non-thermal velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm nth}$) and the length-scale (L) in the neutral interstellar medium (ISM) using a large number of Hi gas components taken from various published Hi surveys and previous Hi studies. We notice that above the length-scale ($L$) of 0.40 pc, there is a power-law relationship between $\sigma_{\rm nth}$ and $L$. However, below 0.40 pc, there is a break in the power-law, where $\sigma_{\rm nth}$ is not significantly correlated with $L$. It has been observed from the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that for the dataset of $L > 0.40$ pc, the most probable values of intensity ($A$) and power-law index ($p$) are 1.14 and 0.55 respectively. Result of $p$ suggests that the power-law is steeper than the standard Kolmogorov law of turbulence. This is due to the dominance of clouds in the cold neutral medium. This is even more clear when we separate the clouds into two categories: one for $L$ is > 0.40 pc and the kinetic temperature ($T_k$ ) is < 250 K, which are in the cold neutral medium (CNM) and for other one where L is > 0.40 pc and T k is between 250 K and 5000 K, which are in the thermally unstable phase (UNM). Most probable values of $A$ and $p$ are 1.14 and 0.67 respectively in the CNM phase and 1.01 and 0.52 respectively in the UNM phase. A greater number of data points is effective for the UNM phase in constructing a more accurate estimate of $A$ and $p$, since most of the clouds in the UNM phase lie below 500 K. However, from the value of $p$ in the CNM phase, it appears that there is a significant difference from the Kolmogorov scaling, which can be attributed to a shock-dominated medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Many supernovae (SNe) imply an interaction of the SN ejecta with matter (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. This suggests that many massive stars may undergo various degrees of envelope stripping shortly before exploding, and produce a considerable diversity in their pre-explosion CSM properties. We explore a generic set of ~100 detailed massive binary evolution models to characterize the amount of envelope stripping and the expected CSM configurations. Our binary models were computed with the MESA stellar evolution code, considering an initial primary star mass of 12.6 Msun, and focus on initial orbital periods above 500 d. We compute these models up to the time of the primary's iron core collapse. We find that Roche lobe overflow often leads to incomplete stripping of the mass donor, resulting in a large variety of pre-SN envelope masses. Many of our models' red supergiant (RSG) donors undergo core collapse during Roche lobe overflow, with mass transfer and thus system mass loss rates of up to 0.01 Msun/yr at that time. The corresponding CSM densities are similar to those inferred for Type IIn SNe like 1998S. In other cases, the mass transfer turns unstable, leading to a common envelope phase at such late time that the mass donor explodes before the common envelope is fully ejected or the system has merged. We argue that this may cause significant pre-SN variability, as for example in SN 2020tlf. Other models suggest a common envelope ejection just centuries before core collapse, which may lead to the strongest interactions, as in superluminous Type IIn SNe like 1994W, or 2006gy. Wide massive binaries offer a natural framework to understand a broad range of hydrogen-rich interacting SNe. On the other hand, the flash features observed in many Type IIP SNe, like in SN 2013fs, may indicate that RSGs are more extended than currently assumed.

 - **Abstract**
 Apsidal motion is the precession of the line of apsides in the orbit of a binary star due to perturbations from General Relativity (GR), tides, or third body interactions. The rate of precession due to tidal effects depends on the interior structures of the stars and, as a result, binaries where such precession occurs are of great interest. Apsidal motion is observed through the analysis of eclipse times, revealing small changes in the average interval between successive primary and secondary eclipses, taking all available observed times of eclipse and yielding an estimate of the apsidal rate. Given that this is a single observed quantity, various degeneracies are unavoidably present. Ideally, one would have a model that predicts eclipse times given the orbital and stellar parameters. These parameters for a given binary could then be computed using least squares, provided a suitably large number of eclipse times. Here we use the Eclipsing Light Curve (ELC) program as such a model. The Newtonian equations of motion with extra force terms accounting for GR contributions and tidal distortions are integrated, yielding precise sky positions as a function of time. Times of mid-eclipse and instantaneous orbital elements are computed as a function of time. In this paper we outline the method, and compare numerically computed apsidal rates with standard formulae using a set of 15 binaries based on real systems. For our simulated systems, the derived apsidal rates agree with the standard formula.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe~Ia) from both the Carnegie Supernova Project~I (CSP-I) and II (CSP-II), and extend the Hubble diagram from the optical to the near-infrared wavelengths ($uBgVriYJH$). We calculate the Hubble constant, $H_0$ using various distance calibrators: Cepheids, Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB), and Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF). Combining all methods of calibrations, we derive $\rm H_0=71.43 \pm 0.62 \ (stat) \pm 2.43 \ (sys) \ km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}$ from $B$-band, and $\rm H_0=72.65 \pm 0.63 \ (stat) \pm 2.88 \ (sys) \ km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}$ from $H$-band. By assigning equal weight to the Cepheid, TRGB, and SBF calibrators, we derive the systematic errors required for consistency in the first rung of the distance ladder, resulting in an increased systematic error in $H_0$. As a result, the tension between the late-time $H_0$ we derive by combining the various distance calibrators and the early-time $H_0$ from the Cosmic Microwave Background is reduced. The highest precision in SN~Ia luminosity is found in the $Y$ band ($0.12\pm0.01$ mag), as defined by the intrinsic scatter ($\sigma_{int}$). We revisit SN~Ia Hubble residual-host mass correlations and recover previous results that these correlations do not change significantly between the optical and the near-infrared wavelengths. Finally, SNe~Ia that explode beyond 10 kpc from their host centers exhibit smaller dispersion in their luminosity, confirming our earlier findings. Reduced effect of dust in the outskirt of hosts may be responsible for this effect.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a summary of the results of the OJ 287 observational campaign, which was carried out during the 2021/2022 observational season. This season is special in the binary model because the major axis of the precessing binary happens to lie almost exactly in the plane of the accretion disc of the primary. This leads to pairs of almost identical impacts between the secondary black hole and the accretion disk in 2005 and 2022. In 2005, a special flare called "blue flash" was observed 35 days after the disk impact, which should have also been verifiable in 2022. We did observe a similar flash and were able to obtain more details of its properties. We describe this in the framework of expanding cloud models. In addition, we were able to identify the flare arising exactly at the time of the disc crossing from its photo-polarimetric and gamma-ray properties. This is an important identification, as it directly confirms the orbit model. Moreover, we saw a huge flare that lasted only one day. We may understand this as the lighting up of the jet of the secondary black hole when its Roche lobe is suddenly flooded by the gas from the primary disk. Therefore, this may be the first time we directly observed the secondary black hole in the OJ 287 binary system.
#### Biosignature false positives in potentially habitable planets around M  dwarfs: the effect of UV radiation from one flare

 - **Abstract**
 Many past studies have predicted the steady-state production and maintenance of abiotic O$_2$ and O$_3$ in the atmospheres of CO$_2$-rich terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarf stars. However, the time-dependent responses of these planetary atmospheres to flare events - and the possible temporary production or enhancement of false positive biosignatures therein - has been comparatively less well studied. Most past works that have modeled the photochemical response to flares have assumed abundant free oxygen like that of the modern or Proterozoic Earth. Here we examine in detail the photochemical impact of the UV emitted by a single flare on abiotic O$_2$/O$_3$ production in prebiotic, CO$_2$-dominated atmospheres of M dwarf planets with CO$_2$ levels ranging from 10% to 90% of 1 bar. We find that a single flare generally destroys O$_2$ while modestly enhancing O$_3$ column densities. We simulate the spectral observables of both the steady-state atmosphere and time-dependent spectral response over the flare window for both emitted and transmitted light spectra. Over the course of the flare, the O$_3$ UV Hartley band is modestly enhanced by a maximum of 6 ppm while the CO$_2$ molecular transit depths modestly decline by 7 ppm. In both emitted and transmitted light spectra, the 9.65 $\mu$m O$_3$ band is hidden by the overlapping 9.4 $\mu$m CO$_2$ band for all scenarios considered. Overall, we find that the possible enhancements of abiotic O$_3$ due to a single flare are small compared to O$_3$'s sensitivity to other parameters such as CO$_2$ and H$_2$O abundances or the availability of reducing gases such as H$_2$.

 - **Abstract**
 This work aims at investigating the optical transmission system needed for such lightweight sail, taking into account the physical constraints of such unprecedented link and focusing on the optimal scheme for the optical signal emission. In particular, the optical signal is distributed to several emitters on the sail. The light diffraction resulting from the pattern of the emitters acting coherently determines the characteristics of the whole beam transmitted by the sail and of the received signal on the Earth. The performance of the digital communication system using pulse position modulation (PPM) can be assessed and channel coding schemes are proposed. We are using the paradigm for which the entire sail communication system is described as a Tree-of-light: the detectors, CPU, memory and laser transmitter are the central unit, representing the trunk of the tree. The branches of the tree are the waveguides, directed to the sail surface. By means of multimode splitters, the signal is further distributed via the petioles to the emitters, the leaves, realized by grating couplers (GCs), on which this work is more focused.
#### HST-1 as a Window to the Energetics of the Jet Spine of M87

 - **Abstract**
 A new interpretation of the optical knot in the jet of M87, HST-1, is presented. High sensitivity 22 GHz Very Large Array images locate HST-1 to within 6 mas of the jet axis immediately upstream. 1.7 GHz Very Long Baseline Array images of a bright flare in 2005 indicates that the preponderance of emission in the early stages originates in an elongated region that is tilted $12.5^{\circ}$ from the jet axis. The superluminal motion, shape, location and the large jet-aligned optical/UV polarization suggest an identification with the putative relativistic spine of the jet. As such, energy flux estimates for HST-1, $\sim 870$ mas from the nucleus, published in 2006 indicate that the central engine injected $Q_{\rm{spine}}\approx 2.5 \times 10^{41}\rm{ergs/s}$ into the base of the spine $\sim 200$ years earler. Furthermore, previous studies reveal a tubular protonic jet on sub-mas scales that envelopes a low luminosity core, presumably the faint spine base. It was estimated that the central engine injected $Q_{\rm{tubular\,jet}}\approx 6.1\times 10^{41}\rm{ergs/s}$ $\sim 1.5$ years earlier. If one component of the jet is inherently more powerful, a firm constraint on total jet power in the recent past exists. If the emitted jet is inherently dominated by the spine (tubular jet) then the total bilaterally symmetric jet power emitted from the central engine was $<4Q_{\rm{spine}}\approx 1.0 \times 10^{42}\rm{ergs/s}$ ($< 4Q_{\rm{tubular\,jet}}\approx 2.4\times 10^{42}\rm{ergs/s}$) $\sim 200$ ($\sim 1.5$) years earlier. Assuming a nearly constant central engine injected jet power for $\sim 200$ years indicates a total jet power of $\lesssim 2\times 10^{42}$ ergs/s in epochs of modern observation or $\lesssim 3.5\%$ jet production efficiency for an accretion rate of 0.001$M_{\odot}$/yr.
