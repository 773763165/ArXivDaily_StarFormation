 - **Abstract**
 Understanding planetesimal formation is an essential first step to understanding planet formation. The distribution of these first solid bodies will drive the locations where planetary embryos can grow. We seek to understand the parameter space of possible protoplanetary disk formation and evolution models of our Solar System. A good protoplanetary disk scenario for the Solar System must meet at least the following three criteria: 1) an extended dust disk (at least 45 au); 2) formation of planetesimals in at least two distinct locations; and 3) transport of high temperatures condensates (i.e., calcium-aluminium-rich inclusion, CAIs) to the outer disk. We explore a large parameter space to study the effect of the disk viscosity, the timescale of infall of material into the disk, the distance within which material is deposited into the disk, and the fragmentation threshold of dust particles. We find that scenarios with a large initial disk viscosity ($\alpha>0.05$), relatively short infall timescale ($T_{infall}<100-200$ kyr), and a small centrifugal radius ($R_C\sim0.4$~au; the distance within which material falls into the disk) result in disks that satisfy the criteria for a good protoplanetary disk of the Solar System. The large initial viscosity and short infall timescale result in a rapid initial expansion of the disk, which we dub the inflationary phase of the disk. Furthermore, a temperature-dependent fragmentation threshold, which mimics that cold icy particles break more easily, results in larger and more massive disks. This results in more "icy" than "rocky" planetesimals. Such scenarios are also better in line with our Solar System, which has small terrestrial planets and massive giant planet cores. Finally, we find that scenarios with large $R_C$ cannot transport CAIs to the outer disk and do not produce planetesimals at two locations within the disk.

 - **Abstract**
 The dissertation presents result from study of Pre-main sequence (PMS) stars that are in the earliest stages of stellar evolution. These young stellar objects are still in the process of formation, and the energy they emit is produced only by gravitational contraction. The main results were obtained with the telescopes at the National Astronomical Observatory Rozhen, as well as with the use of archival photographic observations and spectral observations obtained in collaboration with colleagues from abroad. Our results are obtained by studying the photometric and spectral variability of PMS stars. Our main goal is to study the processes of star formation, the formation of circumstellar disks, the structure of the circumstellar environment and the interaction of the star-disk system. The results of our research have been published in 65 scientific papers that have been cited over 300 times. The photometric and spectral variability of PMS stars is of great importance for modeling star formation processes. On the one hand, photometric variability allows us to easily detect young objects, since they are characterized by rapid variability and in many cases with large amplitudes. On the other hand, stars form in groups and are physically located in the same geometric space, and several variable objects that are at approximately the same stage of evolution can be observed simultaneously. Comparing star systems of different ages can be used to trace the stages of stellar evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on a novel laboratory method, 14 mm-wave lines of the molecular ion H$_2$CCCH$^+$ have been measured in high resolution, and the spectroscopic constants of this asymmetric rotor determined with high accuracy. Using the Yebes 40 m and IRAM 30 m radio telescopes, we detect four lines of H$_2$CCCH$^+$ towards the cold dense core TMC-1. With a dipole moment of about 0.55 Debye obtained from high-level ab initio calculations, we derive a column density of 5.4$\pm$1$\times$10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ and 1.6$\pm$0.5$\times$10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the ortho and para species, respectively, and an abundance ratio N(H$_2$CCC)/N(H$_2$CCCH$^+$)= 2.8$\pm$0.7. The chemistry of H$_2$CCCH$^+$ is modelled using the most recent chemical network for the reactions involving the formation of H$_2$CCCH$^+$. We find a reasonable agreement between model predictions and observations, and new insights into the chemistry of C$_3$ bearing species in TMC-1 are obtained.
#### On the Internal Structure of Relativistic Jets with Zero Velocity Along  the Axis
 - **Authors:** V. S. Beskin, F. A. Kniazev, K. Chatterjee
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01890
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01890
 - **Abstract**
 The present work is devoted to the analysis of the internal structure of relativistic jets under the condition that the velocity of the plasma flow at the jet axis vanishes. It is shown that in spite of the seemingly fundamental difference in the formulation of the problem at the axis, the key properties of the internal structure of such relativistic jets remain the same as for nonzero velocity along the axis. In both cases, at a sufficiently low ambient pressure, a dense core appears near the axis, the radius of which is close to the size of the light cylinder.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of ALMA-ACA 7 m-array observations in $^{12}$CO($J=2-1$), $^{13}$CO($J=2-1$), and C$^{18}$O($J=2-1$) line emission toward the molecular-gas disk in the Local Group spiral galaxy M33 at an angular resolution of 7''.31 $\times$ 6''.50 (30 pc $\times$ 26 pc). We combined the ACA 7 m-array $^{12}$CO($J=2-1$) data with the IRAM 30 m data to compensate for emission from diffuse molecular-gas components. The ACA+IRAM combined $^{12}$CO($J=2-1$) map clearly depicts the cloud-scale molecular-gas structure over the M33 disk. Based on the ACA+IRAM $^{12}$CO($J=2-1$) cube data, we cataloged 848 molecular clouds with a mass range from $10^3$ $M_{\odot}$ to $10^6$ $M_{\odot}$. We found that high-mass clouds ($\geq 10^5 M_{\odot}$) tend to associate with the $8 \mu$m-bright sources in the spiral arm region, while low-mass clouds ($< 10^5 M_{\odot}$) tend to be apart from such $8 \mu$m-bright sources and to exist in the inter-arm region. We compared the cataloged clouds with GMCs observed by the IRAM 30 m telescope at 49 pc resolution (IRAM GMC: Corbelli et al. 2017), and found that a small IRAM GMC is likely to be identified as a single molecular cloud even in ACA+IRAM CO data, while a large IRAM GMC can be resolved into multiple ACA+IRAM clouds. The velocity dispersion of a large IRAM GMC is mainly dominated by the line-of-sight velocity difference between small clouds inside the GMC rather than the internal cloud velocity broadening.
#### Modelling dynamically driven global cloud formation microphysics in the  HAT-P-1b atmosphere

 - **Abstract**
 Insight into the formation and global distribution of cloud particles in exoplanet atmospheres continues to be a key problem to tackle going into the JWST era. Understanding microphysical cloud processes and atmospheric feedback mechanisms in 3D has proven to be a challenging prospect for exoplaneteers. In an effort to address the large computational burden of coupling these models in 3D simulations, we develop an open source, lightweight and efficient microphysical cloud model for exoplanet atmospheres. `Mini-cloud' is a microphysical based cloud model for exoplanet condensate clouds that can be coupled to contemporary general circulation models (GCMs) and other time dependent simulations. We couple mini-cloud to the Exo-FMS GCM and use a prime JWST target, the hot Jupiter HAT-P-1b, as a test case for the cloud formation module. After 1000+ of days of integration with mini-cloud, our results show a complex 3D cloud structure with cloud properties relating closely the dynamical and temperature properties of the atmosphere. Current transit and emission spectra data are best fit with a reduced cloud particle number density compared to the nominal simulation, with our simulated JWST NIRISS SOSS spectra showing promising prospects for characterising the atmosphere in detail. Overall, our study is another small step in first principles 3D exoplanet cloud formation microphysical modelling. We suggest that additional physics not included in the present model, such as coagulation, are required to reduce the number density of particles to appropriately observed levels.
#### Bayesian evidence for spectral lag transition due to Lorentz Invariance  Violation for 32 Fermi/GBM Gamma-ray Bursts

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.02296
 - **Abstract**
 We use the spectral lag data of 32 long GRBs detected by Fermi/GBM, which has been recently collated in Liu et al (2022) to carry out a search for Lorentz Invariance violation (LIV) using Bayesian model selection. We use two different parametric functions to model the null hypothesis of only intrinsic emission: a smooth broken power law model (SBPL) (proposed in Liu et al) as well as a simple power law model, which has been widely used before in literature. We find that using the SBPL model as the null hypothesis, only three GRBs show decisive evidence for linear LIV, of which only one shows decisive evidence for quadratic LIV. When we use the simple power-law model as the null hypothesis, we find 15 and 16 GRBs showing decisive evidence for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively. Finally, when we apply the SBPL model to model the intrinsic emission in GRB 1606025B, the evidence for LIV (which was previously reported using the simple power law model) disappears. This underscores the importance of adequately modelling the intrinsic emission while searching for evidence of LIV using spectral lags.
