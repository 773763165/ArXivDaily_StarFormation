 - **Abstract**
 We analytically solve the problem of Bose star growth in the bath of gravitationally interacting particles. We find that after nucleation of this object, the bath is described by a self-similar solution of the kinetic equation, which is an attractor. Together with the conservation laws, this fixes mass evolution of the Bose star. Our results explain slowdown of the star growth at a certain "core-halo" mass, but also predict formation of the heavier and lighter objects in magistral dark matter models.

 - **Abstract**
 The most extensive survey of carbon monoxide (CO) gas in the Taurus molecular cloud relied on $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO $J=1 \rightarrow 0$ emission only, distinguishing the region where $^{12}$CO is detected without $^{13}$CO (named mask 1 region) from the one where both are detected (mask 2 region). We have taken advantage of recent $^{12}$CO $J=3\rightarrow2$ JCMT observations where they include mask 1 regions to estimate density, temperature, and $N$(CO) with a LVG model. This represents 1395 pixels out of $\sim$1.2 million in the mark 1 region. Compared to Pineda et al. (2010) results, and assuming a $T_\textrm{kin}$ of 30 K, we find a higher volume density of molecular hydrogen of 3.3$\rm \times\ 10^3$ $\textrm{cm}^{-3}$, compared to their 250--700 $\textrm{cm}^{-3}$ and a CO column density of 5.7$\rm \times\ 10^{15}\ \textrm{cm}^{-2}$, about a quarter of their value. The differences are important and show the necessity to observe several CO transitions to better describe the intermediate region between the dense cloud and the diffuse atomic medium. Future observations to extend the $^{12}$CO $J=3\rightarrow2$ mapping further away from the $^{13}$CO--detected region comprising mask 1 are needed to revisit our understanding of the diffuse portions of dark clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results from our deep optical photometric observations of Bochum 2 (Boc2) star cluster obtained using the $1.3$m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope along with archival photometric data from Pan-STARRS2/2MASS/UKIDSS surveys. We also used high-quality parallax and proper motion data from the $Gaia$ Data Release 3. We found that the Boc2 cluster has a small size ($\sim$1.1 pc) and circular morphology. Using $Gaia$ parallax of member stars and isochrone fitting method, the distance of this cluster is estimated as $3.8\pm0.4$ kpc. We have found that this cluster holds young ($\sim5$ Myr) and massive (O$7-$O$9$) stars as well as an older population of low mass stars. We found that the massive stars have formed in the inner region of the Boc2 cluster in a recent epoch of star formation. We have derived mass function slope ($\Gamma$) in the cluster region as $-2.42\pm0.13$ in the mass range $\sim0.72<$M/M$_{\odot}<2.8$. The tidal radius of the Boc2 cluster ($\sim7-9$) is much more than its observed radius ($\sim1.1$ pc). This suggests that most of the low-mass stars in this cluster are the remains of an older population of stars formed via an earlier epoch of star formation.
#### Interior-atmosphere modelling to assess the observability of rocky  planets with JWST

 - **Abstract**
 Super-Earths present compositions dominated by refractory materials. However, there is a degeneracy in their interior structure between a planet with no atmosphere and a small Fe content, and a planet with a thin atmosphere and a higher core mass fraction. To break this degeneracy, atmospheric characterization observations are required. We present a self-consistent interior-atmosphere model to constrain the volatile mass fraction, surface pressure, and temperature of rocky planets with water and CO2 atmospheres. These parameters obtained in our analysis can then be used to predict observations in emission spectroscopy and photometry with JWST, which can determine the presence of an atmosphere, and if present, its composition. To obtain the bolometric emission and Bond albedo for an atmosphere in radiative-convective equilibrium, we present the k-uncorrelated approximation for fast computations within our retrieval on planetary mass, radius and host stellar abundances. For the generation of emission spectra, we use our k-correlated atmospheric model. An adaptive MCMC is used for an efficient sampling of the parameter space at low volatile mass fractions. We show how to use our modelling approach to predict observations with JWST for TRAPPIST-1 c and 55 Cancri e. TRAPPIST-1 c's most likely scenario is a bare surface, although the presence of an atmosphere cannot be ruled out. If the emission in the MIRI F1500 filter is 731 ppm or higher, there would be a water-rich atmosphere. For fluxes between 730 and 400 ppm, no atmosphere is present, while low emission fluxes (300 ppm) indicate a CO2-dominated atmosphere. In the case of 55 Cancri e, a combined spectrum with NIRCam and MIRI LRS may present high uncertainties at wavelengths between 3 and 3.7 $\mu$m. However, this does not affect the identification of H2O and CO2 because they do not present spectral features in this wavelength range.
#### Impact of astrophysical effects on the dark matter mass constraint with  21cm intensity mapping

 - **Abstract**
 We present an innovative approach to constraining the non-cold dark matter model using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We perform a suite of hydrodynamic simulations with varying dark matter particle masses and generate mock 21cm radio intensity maps to trace the dark matter distribution. Our proposed method complements the traditional power spectrum analysis. We compare our CNN classification results with those from the power spectrum of the differential brightness temperature map of 21cm radiation, and find that the CNN outperforms the latter. Moreover, we investigate the impact of baryonic physics on the dark matter model constraint, including star formation, self-shielding of HI gas, and UV background model. We find that these effects may introduce some contamination in the dark matter constraint, but they are insignificant when compared to the realistic system noise of the SKA instruments.
#### Coma environment of comet C/2017 K2 around the water ice sublimation  boundary observed with VLT/MUSE

 - **Abstract**
 We report a new imaging spectroscopic observation of Oort-cloud comet C/2017 K2 (hereafter K2) on its way to perihelion at 2.53 au, around a heliocentric distance where H2O ice begins to play a key role in comet activation. Normalized reflectances over 6 500--8 500 AA for its inner and outer comae are 9.7+/-0.5 and 7.2+/-0.3 % (10^3 AA)^-1, respectively, the latter being consistent with the slope observed when the comet was beyond the orbit of Saturn. The dust coma at the time of observation appears to contain three distinct populations: mm-sized chunks prevailing at <~10^3 km; a 10^5-km steady-state dust envelope; and fresh anti-sunward jet particles. the dust chunks dominate the continuum signal and are distributed over a similar radial distance scale as the coma region with redder dust than nearby. they also appear to be co-spatial with OI1D, suggesting that the chunks may accommodate H2O ice with a fraction (>~1 %) of refractory materials. The jet particles do not colocate with any gas species detected. The outer coma spectrum contains three significant emissions from C2(0,0) Swan band, OI1D, and CN(1,0 red band, with an overall deficiency in NH2. Assuming that all OI1D flux results from H2O dissociation, we compute an upper limit on the water production rate Q_H2O of ~7 x 10^28 molec s^-1 (with an uncertainty of a factor of two). the production ratio log[Q_C2/Q_CN] of K2 suggests that the comet has typical carbon-chain composition, with the value potentially changing with distance from the Sun. Our observations suggest that water ice-containing dust chunks (>0.1 mm) near K2's nucleus emitted beyond 4 au may be responsible for its very low gas rotational temperature and the discrepancy between its optical and infrared lights reported at similar heliocentric distances.
#### Massive pre-main-sequence stars in M17: $1^{\rm st}$ and $2^{\rm nd}$  overtone CO bandhead emission and the thermal infrared

 - **Abstract**
 Recently much progress has been made in probing the embedded stages of massive star formation, pointing to formation scenarios akin to a scaled up version of low-mass star formation. However, the latest stages of massive star formation have rarely been observed. Using 1st and 2nd overtone CO bandhead emission and near- to mid-infrared photometry we aim to characterize the remnant formation disks around 5 unique pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars with masses $6-12~\rm M_{\odot}$, that have constrained stellar parameters thanks to their detectable photospheres. We seek to understand this emission and the disks it originates from in the context of the evolutionary stage of the studied sources. We use an analytic LTE disk model to fit the CO bandhead and the dust emission, found to originate in different disk regions. For the first time we modeled the 2nd overtone emission. Furthermore, we fit continuum normalized bandheads and show the importance of this in constraining the emission region. We also include $^{13}\rm CO$ in our models as an additional probe of the young nature of the studied objects. We find that the CO emission originates in a narrow region close to the star (<1 AU) and under very similar disk conditions (temperatures and densities) for the different objects. This is consistent with previous modeling of this emission in a diverse range of young stellar objects. We discuss these results in the context of the positions of these PMS stars in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram and the CO emission's association with early age and high accretion rates in (massive) young stellar objects. We conclude that, considering their mass range and for the fact that their photospheres are detected, the M17 PMS stars are observed in a relatively early formation stage. They are therefore excellent candidates for longer wavelength studies to further constrain the end stages of massive star formation.
#### Analytical Fitting of Gamma-ray Photopeaks in Germanium Cross Strip  Detectors

 - **Abstract**
 In an ideal germanium detector, fully-absorbed monoenergetic gamma-rays will appear in the measured spectrum as a narrow peak, broadened into a Gaussian of width determined only by the statistical properties of charge cloud generation and the electronic noise of the readout electronics. Multielectrode detectors complicate this picture. Broadening of the charge clouds as they drift through the detector will lead to charge sharing between neighboring electrodes and, inevitably, low-energy tails on the photopeak spectra. We simulate charge sharing in our germanium cross strip detectors in order to reproduce the low-energy tails due to charge sharing. Our goal is to utilize these simulated spectra to develop an analytical fit (shape function) for the spectral lines that provides a robust and high-quality fit to the spectral profile, reliably reproduces the interaction energy, noise width, and the number of counts in both the true photopeak and the low-energy tail, and minimizes the number of additional parameters. Accurate modeling of the detailed line profiles is crucial for both calibration of the detectors as well as scientific interpretation of measured spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 PySR is an open-source library for practical symbolic regression, a type of machine learning which aims to discover human-interpretable symbolic models. PySR was developed to democratize and popularize symbolic regression for the sciences, and is built on a high-performance distributed back-end, a flexible search algorithm, and interfaces with several deep learning packages. PySR's internal search algorithm is a multi-population evolutionary algorithm, which consists of a unique evolve-simplify-optimize loop, designed for optimization of unknown scalar constants in newly-discovered empirical expressions. PySR's backend is the extremely optimized Julia library SymbolicRegression.jl, which can be used directly from Julia. It is capable of fusing user-defined operators into SIMD kernels at runtime, performing automatic differentiation, and distributing populations of expressions to thousands of cores across a cluster. In describing this software, we also introduce a new benchmark, "EmpiricalBench," to quantify the applicability of symbolic regression algorithms in science. This benchmark measures recovery of historical empirical equations from original and synthetic datasets.
#### Theoretical tidal evolution constants for stellar models from the  pre-main sequence to the white dwarf stage Apsidal motion constants, moment  of inertia, and gravitational potential energy

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most reliable means of studying the stellar interior is through the apsidal motion in double line eclipsing binary systems since these systems present errors in masses, radii, and effective temperatures of only a few per cent. On the other hand, the theoretical values of the apsidal motion to be compared with the observed values depend on the stellar masses of the components and more strongly on their radii (fifth power).The main objective of this work is to make available grids of evolutionary stellar models that, in addition to the traditional parameters (e.g. age, mass, log g, T$_{\rm eff}$), also contain the necessary parameters for the theoretical study of apsidal motion and tidal evolution. This information is useful for the study of the apsidal motion in eclipsing binaries and their tidal evolution, and can also be used for the same purpose in exoplanetary systems. All models were computed using the MESA package. We consider core overshooting for models with masses $\ge$ 1.2 M$_\odot$. For the amount of core overshooting we adopted a recent relationship for mass $\times$ core overshooting. We adopted for the mixing-length parameter $\alpha_{\rm MLT}$ the value 1.84 (the solar-calibrated value). Mass loss was taken into account in two evolutionary phases. The models were followed from the pre-main sequence phase to the white dwarf (WD) stage.The evolutionary models containing age,luminosity, log g, and Teff, as well as the first three harmonics of the internal stellar structure (k$_2$, k$_3$, and k$_4$), the radius of gyration $\beta$ y, and the dimensionless variable $\alpha$, related to gravitational potential energy, are presented in 69 tables covering three chemical compositions: [Fe/H] = -0.50, 0.00, and 0.50. Additional models with different input physics are available.
