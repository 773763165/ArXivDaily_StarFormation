          EphemerisSources.jl: Idiomatic Ephemeris Sourcing and Parsing in Julia

 - **Abstract**
 Students and professionals in astronomy, astrodynamics, astrophysics, and other related fields often download and parse data about objects in our solar system -- ephemeris data -- from two major providers: JPL's publicly-available [Generic SPICE Kernels](this https URL) and JPL's [Horizons platform](this https URL). SPICE kernels are typically read through the SPICE Toolkit, which is available in a variety of programming languages, including the C Programming Language with `CSPICE` [@cspice]. The Julia packages [`this http URL`](this https URL) and [`this http URL`](this https URL) expose many `CSPICE` functions through Julia functions. Julia users can load and interact with SPICE kernels through methods such as `this http URL` and `this http URL`. Horizons provides data through a variety of methods, including email, command-line, graphical web interfaces, and a [REST API](this https URL) [@horizons]. This paper introduces several packages -- `this http URL`, `this http URL`, `this http URL` and `this http URL` -- which allow users to download and process Cartesian state vector data idiomatically, all from within Julia. While ephemeris data comes in many forms, including observer tables, osculating orbital elements, and binary formats, these packages currently target Cartesian state vector (position and velocity) ephemeris data. Through the use of these packages, users can share replicable code which automatically fetches data from publicly-available ephemeris sources, as opposed to manually including ephemeris data files with their source code distribution.

          The GAPS Programme at TNG. LXV. Precise density measurement of TOI-1430 b, a young planet with an evaporating atmosphere

 - **Abstract**
 Small-sized exoplanets in tight orbits around young stars (10-1000 Myr) give us the opportunity to investigate the mechanisms that led to their formation, the evolution of their physical and orbital properties and, especially, of their atmospheres. Thanks to the all-sky survey carried out by TESS, many of these exoplanets have been discovered and have subsequently been characterized with dedicated follow-up observations. In the context of a collaboration among the GAPS, TKS and CPS teams, we measured with a high level of precision the mass and the radius of TOI-1430 b, a young (~700 Myr) exoplanet with an escaping He atmosphere orbiting the K-dwarf star HD 235088 (TOI-1430). By adopting appropriate stellar parameters, which were measured in this work, we were able to simultaneously model the signals due to strong stellar activity and the transiting planet TOI-1430 b in both photometric and spectroscopic series. This allowed us to measure the density of the planet with high precision, and reconstruct the evolution of its atmosphere. TOI-1430 is an active K-dwarf star born 700+/-150 Myr ago and rotates in ~12 d. It hosts a mini-Neptune whose orbital period is Pb=7.434133+/-0.000004 d. Thanks to long-term monitoring of this target performed with TESS, HARPS-N, HIRES, and APF, we estimated a radius Rb=1.98+/-0.07 $R_{\oplus}$, a mass Mb=4.2+/-0.8 $M_{\oplus}$, and thus a planetary density $\rho$b=0.5+/-0.1 $\rho_{\oplus}$. TOI-1430 b is hence a low-density mini-Neptune with an extended atmosphere, at the edge of the radius gap. Because this planet is known to have an evaporating atmosphere of He, we reconstructed its atmospheric history. Our analysis supports the scenario in which, shortly after its birth, TOI-1430 b may have been super-puffy, with a radius 5x-13x and a mass 1.5x-2x that of today; in ~200 Myr from now, TOI-1430 b should lose its envelope, showing its Earth-size core.

          A non-axisymmetric potential for the Milky Way disk

 - **Abstract**
 We provide a purely dynamical global map of the non-axisymmetric structure of the Milky Way disk. For this, we exploit the information contained within the in-plane motions of disk stars from Gaia DR3 to adjust a model of the Galactic potential, including a detailed parametric form for the bar and spiral arms. We explore the parameter space of the non-axisymmetric components with the backward integration method, first adjusting the bar model to selected peaks of the stellar velocity distribution in the Solar neighbourhood, and then adjusting the amplitude, phase, pitch angle and pattern speed of spiral arms to the median radial velocity as a function of position within the disk. We check a posteriori that our solution also qualitatively reproduces various other features of the global non-axisymmetric phase-space distribution, including most of the moving groups and phase-space ridges despite those not being primarily used in the adjustment. This fiducial model has a bar with pattern speed $37~{\rm kms}^{-1}{\rm kpc}^{-1}$ and two spiral modes that are two-armed and three-armed respectively. The two-armed spiral mode has a $\sim 25~\%$ local contrast surface density, a low pattern speed of $13.1~{\rm kms}^{-1}{\rm kpc}^{-1}$, and matches the location of the Crux-Scutum, Local and Outer arm segments. The three-armed spiral mode has a $\sim 9~\%$ local contrast density, a slightly higher pattern speed of $16.4~{\rm kms}^{-1}{\rm kpc}^{-1}$, and matches the location of the Carina-Sagittarius and Perseus arm segments. The Galactic bar, with a higher pattern speed than both spiral modes, has recently disconnected from those two arms. The fiducial non-axisymmetric potential presented in this paper, reproducing most non-axisymmetric signatures detected in the stellar kinematics of the Milky Way disk, can henceforth be used to confidently integrate orbits within the Galactic plane.

          A spectro-temporal view of normal branch oscillations in Cygnus X-2 as seen by NICER and NuSTAR

 - **Abstract**
 We report the spectro-temporal study of the neutron star low mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-2 using NICER and NuSTAR data while the source was in the normal branch (NB). We detect a normal branch oscillation (NBO) feature at ~ 5.41 Hz that appears in the middle portion of the NB branch. We note that the NBO appeared only in the 0.5-3 keV energy range, with maximum strength in the 1-2 keV energy band, but was absent in the 3-10 keV energy band of NuSTAR and NICER data. The energy spectrum of the source exhibits an emission feature at ~ 1 keV, previously identified as the Fe L transition in the outer region of the accretion disk. Upon considering both the Fe L and NBO features, we suggest that the originating location of the Fe L line and the NBOs may coincide and perhaps be due to the same underlying mechanism. Therefore, lags seen in the frequency/energy dependent lag spectra of Cygnus X-2 could be considered to be arising from a region of photoionized material far from the central source. We study the frequency and energy dependent lag spectra of the source, which exhibited a few milliseconds hard lag at the NBO frequency (12-15 ms) and a switch from hard to soft lags at 1 keV. The rms spectrum peaks at 1 keV and the covariance spectrum clearly resembles a thermal spectrum. We discuss the spectro-temporal behavior of the NBO and attempt to constrain its location of origin.

          Evolution of Supernova Remnants in a Cloudy Multiphase Interstellar Medium

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of supernova remnants (SNRs) in a two-phase cloudy medium by performing a series of high-resolution (up to $\Delta x\approx0.01\,\mathrm{pc}$), 3D hydrodynamical simulations including radiative cooling and thermal conduction. We aim to reach a resolution that directly captures the shock-cloud interactions for the majority of the clouds initialized by the saturation of thermal instability. In comparison to the SNR in a uniform medium with the volume filling warm medium, the SNR expands similarly (following $\propto t^{2/5}$) but sweeps up more mass as the cold clouds contribute before shocks in the warm medium become radiative. However, the SNR in a cloudy medium continuously loses energy after shocks toward the cold clouds cool, resulting in less hot gas mass, thermal energy, and terminal momentum. Thermal conduction has little effect on the dynamics of the SNR but smooths the morphology and modifies the internal structure by increasing the density of hot gas by a factor of $\sim 3-5$. The simulation results are not fully consistent with many previous 1D models describing the SNR in a cloudy medium including a mass loading term. By direct measurement in the simulations, we find that, apart from the mass source, the energy sink is also important with a spatially flat cooling rate $\dot{e}\propto t^{-11/5}$. As an illustration, we show an example 1D model including both mass source and energy sink terms (in addition to the radiative cooling in the volume filling component) that better describes the structure of the simulated SNR.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on an international scientific conference, where we brought together the African and European academic astronomy communities. This conference aimed to bridge the gap between those in position of privilege, with ease of access to international networking events (i.e., the typical experience of those affiliated with Western institutions), with those who have been historically excluded (affecting the majority of African scientists/institutions). We describe how we designed the conference around cutting-edge problems in the research field, but with a large focus on building networking and professional relationships. Significant effort went into: (1) ensuring a diverse representation of participants; (2) practically and financially supporting those who may have never attended an international conference and; (3) creating an inclusive and supportive environment through a careful programme of activities, both before and during the event. Throughout this process maintaining scientific integrity was a core commitment. We summarise some of the successes, challenges, and lessons learnt from organising this conference. We also present feedback obtained from participants, which demonstrates an overall achievement of our objectives. This is all combined to provide some key recommendations for any groups, from any research field, who wishes to lead similar initiatives.

          Temporal Changes in the Infrared Spectra of Magellanic Carbon Stars

 - **Abstract**
 The Medium-Resolution Spectrometer on the Mid-Infrared Instrument on JWST obtained spectra of three carbon stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Two of the spectra differ significantly from spectra obtained ~16-19 years earlier with the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope. The one semi-regular variable among the three has changed little. The long-period Mira variable in the sample shows changes consistent with its pulsation cycle. The short-period Mira shows dramatic changes in the strength of its molecular absorption bands, with some bands growing weaker and some stronger. Whether these variations result from its pulsation cycle or its evolution is not clear.

          Streams and Bubbles: Tidal Shaping of Planetary Outflows

 - **Abstract**
 Planets lose mass to atmospheric outflows, and this mass loss is thought to be central in shaping the bimodal population of gaseous giant and rocky terrestrial exoplanets in close orbits. We model the escape of planetary atmospheres in three dimensional gas dynamic simulations in order to study their emergent morphology. Planetary outflows show a range of shapes from fast, isotropic outflows bounded by bow shocks to slower motion confined to thin streams. We show that a crucial factor is the role of the tidal gravity and orbiting reference frame in which planets lose mass. Flows can be characterized by the dimensionless Rossby number evaluated at the scale of the Hill sphere. Flows with a low Rossby number are significantly deviated and shaped by the stellar gravity, while those with a high Rossby number are comparatively unaffected. Rossby number alone is sufficient to predict outflow morphology as well as kinematic gradients across transit. The known exoplanet population should span a range of outflow Rossby numbers and thus shapes. We can use this information to constrain outflow physics and to inform observing strategies.

 - **Abstract**
 Star-forming regions host a large and evolving suite of molecular species. Molecular transition lines, particularly of complex molecules, can reveal the physical and dynamical environment of star formation. We aim to study the large-scale structure and environment of high-mass star formation through single-dish observations of CH$_3$CCH, CH$_3$OH, and H$_2$CO. We have conducted a wide-band spectral survey with the IRAM 30-m telescope and the 100-m GBT towards the high-mass star-forming region DR21(OH)/N44. We use a multi-component local thermodynamic equilibrium model to determine the large-scale physical environment near DR21(OH) and the surrounding dense clumps. We follow up with a radiative transfer code for CH$_3$OH to look at non-LTE behaviour. We then use a gas-grain chemical model to understand the formation routes of these molecules in their observed environments. We disentangle multiple components of DR21(OH) in each of the three molecules. We find a warm and cold component each towards the dusty condensations MM1 and MM2, and a fifth broad, outflow component. We also reveal warm and cold components towards other dense clumps in our maps: N40, N36, N41, N38, and N48. We find thermal mechanisms are adequate to produce the observed abundances of H$_2$CO and CH$_3$CCH while non-thermal mechanisms are needed to produce CH$_3$OH. Through a combination of wide-band mapping observations, LTE and non-LTE model analysis, and chemical modelling, we disentangle the different velocity and temperature components within our clump-scale beam, a scale that links a star-forming core to its parent cloud. We find numerous warm, 20-80 K components corresponding to known cores and outflows in the region. We determine the production routes of these species to be dominated by grain chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 The Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) is the first in-ice radio array in the northern hemisphere for the detection of ultra-high energy neutrinos via the coherent radio emission from neutrino-induced particle cascades within the ice. The array is currently in phased construction near Summit Station on the Greenland ice sheet, with 7~stations deployed during the first two boreal summer field seasons of 2021 and 2022. In this paper, we describe the installation and system design of these initial RNO-G stations, and discuss the performance of the array as of summer 2024.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiation is a universal friction-increasing agent. When two fluid layers are in relative motion, the inevitable exchange of radiation between such layers gives rise to an effective force, which tries to prevent the layers from sliding. This friction is often modeled as a Navier-Stokes shear viscosity. However, non-Newtonian corrections are expected to appear at distances of about one optical depth from the layers' interface. Such corrections prevent the viscous stress from becoming too large. Here, we set the foundations of a rigorous theory for these corrections, valid along incompressible flows. We show that, in the linear regime, the infinite Chapman-Enskog series can be computed analytically, leading to universal formulas for all transport coefficients, which apply to any fluid, with any composition, with radiation of any type (also neutrinos), and with nearly any type of radiative process. We then show that, with an appropriate shear-heat coupling coefficient, Israel-Stewart theory can correctly describe most non-Newtonian features of radiative shear stresses.

          Comet ATLAS (C/2024 S1) -- Second Ground-Based Discovery of a Kreutz Sungrazer in Thirteen Years

 - **Abstract**
 Comet ATLAS (C/2024 S1) is a bright dwarf sungrazer, the second Kreutz comet discovery from the ground this century, 13 years after comet Lovejoy (C/2011 W3). The Population II membership of comet ATLAS sets it apart from the overwhelming majority of other bright dwarf sungrazers, most of them classified as members of Populations I, Pe, or Pre-I in the context of the contact-binary model. The new sungrazer might be closely related to comet du Toit (C/1945 X1), but most exciting is the possibility that it is a fragment of the parent comet of the Great September Comet of 1882 (C/1882 R1) and comet Ikeya-Seki (C/1965 S1). However, this scenario requires that the original orbital period of comet ATLAS -- rather poorly known at present -- be 886 yr. If its orbital period should turn out to be decidedly shorter, another scenario involving a 13th-century sungrazer should be preferred instead. More work on the orbit needs to be done. The apparent contradiction between the discovery of comet ATLAS and previous failures to find any dwarf Kreutz sungrazers in images taken with large ground-based telescopes at moderate heliocentric distances is explained by the propensity of Population II dwarf comets for outbursts, acting in collusion with extremely rare occurrences of these objects. Also addressed are the dynamical properties of perihelion fragmentation as well as the nature and timing of the expected 21st-century cluster of Kreutz comets, swarms of dwarf sungrazers, and related issues.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational-lensing parallax of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is an intriguing probe of primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter in the asteroid-mass window, $2\times 10^{-16}M_{\odot} \lesssim M_{\text{PBH}} \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-12}M_{\odot}$. Recent work in the literature has shown exciting potential reach for this "picolensing" signal if a future space mission were to fly two x-/$\gamma$-ray detectors in the Swift/BAT class, with inter-spacecraft separation baselines on the order of the Earth-Moon distance. We revisit these projections with a view to understanding their robustness to various uncertainties related to GRBs. Most importantly, we investigate the impact of uncertainties in observed GRB angular sizes on reach projections for a future mission. Overall, we confirm that picolensing shows great promise to explore the asteroid-mass window; however, we find that previous studies may have been too optimistic with regard to the baselines required. Detector baselines on the order of at least the Earth-L2 distance would make such a mission more robust to GRB size uncertainties; baselines on the order of an astronomical unit (AU) would additionally enable reach that equals or exceeds existing microlensing constraints up to $M_{\text{PBH}}\sim 10^{-5}M_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss the usability of the gravitational wave detector LISA for studying the orientational distribution of compact white dwarf binaries in the Galactic bulge. We pay special attention to measuring the dipole pattern of the distribution around the Galactic rotation axis. Based on our new formulation, which leverages the parity properties of the involved systems, we found that the apparent thickness of the bulge in the sky becomes critical for the dipole measurement. We also discuss the extra-Galactic studies for black hole binaries and neutron star binaries with BBO/DECIGO.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the temporal and spatial variations in lithium abundance within the Milky Way using a sample of 22,034 main-sequence turn-off (MSTO) stars and subgiants, characterised by precise stellar ages, 3D NLTE (non-local thermodynamic equilibrium) lithium abundances, and birth radii. Our results reveal a complex variation in lithium abundance with stellar age: a gradual increase from 14 Gyr to 6 Gyr, followed by a decline between 6 Gyr and 4.5 Gyr, and a rapid increase thereafter. We find that young Li-rich stars (ages $<$ 4 Gyr, A(Li) $>$ 2.7 dex) predominantly originate from the outer disc. By binning the sample according to guiding center radius and z$_{\rm max}$, we observe that these young Li-rich stars migrate radially to the local and inner discs. In addition, the stars originating from the inner disc experienced a rapid Li enrichment process between 8 Gyr and 6 Gyr. Our analysis suggests that the age range of Li-dip stars is 4-5 Gyr, encompassing evolution stages from MSTO stars to subgiants. The Galactic radial profile of A(Li) (with respect to birth radius), as a function of age, reveals three distinct periods: 14-6 Gyr ago, 6-4 Gyr ago, and 4-1 Gyr ago. Initially, the lithium abundance gradient is positive, indicating increasing Li abundance with birth radius. During the second period, it transitions to a negative and broken gradient, mainly affected by Li-dip stars. In the final period, the gradient reverts to a positive trend.

 - **Abstract**
 The standing waves existed in radio telescope data are primarily due to reflections among the instruments, which significantly impact the spectrum quality of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Eliminating these standing waves for FAST is challenging given the constant changes in their phases and amplitudes. Over a ten-second period, the phases shift by 18$^{\circ}$ while the amplitudes fluctuate by 6 mK. Thus, we developed the fast Fourier transform (FFT) filter method to eliminate these standing waves for every individual spectrum. The FFT filter can decrease the root mean square (RMS) from 3.2 to 1.15 times the theoretical estimate. Compared to other methods such as sine fitting and running median, the FFT filter achieves a median RMS of approximately 1.2 times the theoretical expectation and the smallest scatter at 12%. Additionally, the FFT filter method avoids the flux loss issue encountered with some other methods. The FFT is also efficient in detecting harmonic radio frequency interference (RFI). In the FAST data, we identified three distinct types of harmonic RFI, each with amplitudes exceeding 100 mK and intrinsic frequency periods of 8.1, 0.5, and 0.37 MHz, respectively. The FFT filter, proven as the most effective method, is integrated into the HI data calibration and imaging pipeline for FAST (HiFAST, this https URL).

          Grain Size in the Class I Protostellar System TMC-1A Constrained with ALMA and VLA Observations

 - **Abstract**
 The disk mass and substructure in young stellar objects suggest that planet formation may start at the protostellar stage through the growth of dust grains. To accurately estimate the grain size at the protostellar stage, we have observed the Class I protostar TMC-1A using the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at the Q (7 mm) and Ka (9 mm) bands at a resolution of ~0.2" and analyzed archival data of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at Band 6 (1.3 mm) and 7 (0.9 mm) that cover the same spatial scale. The VLA images show a compact structure with a size of ~25 au and a spectral index of ~2.5. The ALMA images show compact and extended structures with a spectral index of ~2 at the central ~40 au region and another index of ~3.3 in the outer region. Our SED analysis using the observed fluxes at the four bands suggests one branch with a small grain size of ~0.12 mm and another with a grown grain size of ~4 mm. We also model polarized dust continuum emission adopting the two grain sizes and compare them with an observational result of TMC-1A, suggesting that the small grain size is preferable to the grown grain size. The small grain size implies gravitational instability in the TMC-1A disk, which is consistent with a spiral-like component recently identified.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The small- to intermediate-mass ($M <0.8 M_\odot$), most metal-poor stars that formed in the infancy of the Universe are still shining today in the sky. They are very rare, but their discovery and investigation brings new knowledge on the formation of the first stellar generations. Aims: SDSS J102915.14+172927.9 is one of the most metal-poor star known to date. Since no carbon can be detected in its spectrum, a careful upper limit is important, both to classify this star and to distinguish it from the carbon-enhanced stars that represent the majority at these metallicities. Methods: We undertook a new observational campaign to acquire high-resolution UVES spectra. The new spectra were combined with archival spectra in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. From the combined spectrum, we derived abundances for seven elements (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, Ni, and a tentative Li) and five significant upper limits (C, Na, Al, Sr, and Ba). Results: The star has a carbon abundance A(C) <4.68 and therefore is not enhanced in carbon, at variance with the majority of the stars at this Fe regime, which typically show A(C)> 6.0. A feature compatible with the Li doublet at 670.7 nm is tentatively detected. Conclusions: The upper limit on carbon implies $Z<1.915 \times 10^{-6}$, more than 20 times lower than the most iron-poor star known. Therefore, the gas cloud out of which the star was formed did not cool via atomic lines but probably through dust. Fragmentation of the primordial cloud is another possibility for the formation of a star with a metallicity this low.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by the vast gap between photometric and spectroscopic data volumes, there is great potential in using 5D kinematic information to identify and study substructures of the Milky Way. We identify substructures in the Galactic halo using 46,575 RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) from Gaia DR3 with the photometric metallicities and distances newly estimated by Li et al. (2023). Assuming a Gaussian prior distribution of radial velocity, we calculate the orbital distribution characterized by the integrals of motion for each RRL based on its 3D positions, proper motions and corresponding errors, and then apply the friends-of-friends algorithm to identify groups moving along similar orbits. We have identified several known substructures, including Sagittarius (Sgr) Stream, Hercules-Aquila Cloud (HAC), Virgo Overdensity (VOD), Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES), Orphan-Chenab stream, Cetus-Palca, Helmi Streams, Sequoia, Wukong and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) leading arm, along with 18 unknown groups. Our findings indicate that HAC and VOD have kinematic and chemical properties remarkably similar to GES, with most HAC and VOD members exhibiting eccentricity as high as GES, suggesting that they may share a common origin with GES. The ability to identify the low mass and spatially dispersed substructures further demonstrates the potential of our method, which breaks the limit of spectroscopic survey and is competent to probe the substructures in the whole Galaxy. Finally, we have also identified 18 unknown groups with good spatial clustering and proper motion consistency, suggesting more excavation of Milky Way substructures in the future with only 5D data.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the interstellar and potentially circumstellar extinction in the sight lines of classical T Tauri stars is an important ingredient for constructing reliable spectral energy distributions, which catalyze protoplanetary disk chemistry, for example. Therefore, some attempts of measuring $A_{V}$ toward individual stars have been made using partly different wavelength regimes and different underlying assumptions. We used strong lines of Ly{\alpha} fluorescent H2 and derived the extinction based on the assumption of optically thin transitions. We investigated a sample of 72 classical T Tauri stars observed with the Hubble Space Telescope in the framework of the ULLYSES program. We computed $A_{V}$ and $R_{V}$ values for the 34 objects with sufficient data quality and an additionally $A_{V}$ value for the canonical $R_{V}$ = 3.1 value. Our results agree largely with values obtained from optical data. Moreover, we confirm the degeneracy between $A_{V}$ and $R_{V}$ and present possibilities to break this. Finally, we discuss whether the assumption of optical thin lines is valid.

 - **Abstract**
 Data access -- or the availability of new and archival data for use by the larger community -- is key for scientific advancement. How data is presented, searched, and formatted determines accessibility and it can be difficult to find a solution that fits the needs of a given subdiscipline. We present a generalized roadmap for developing a specialty astronomy database with web application based on the development of the SpExoDisks (Spectra of Exoplanet forming Disks) database (this http URL), which provides infrared spectra of protoplanetary disks. Expertise in an astronomy subdiscipline can provide two necessary components for creating a database: access to a large volume of specialized data and knowledge of how that data should be presented to the community. However, there are a variety of steps and decisions for database development that can fall outside astronomy expertise. Here we offer generalized discussions on design and process that are accompanied by real-world examples from the SpExoDisks developer team and website. Starting from the database portal design and data organization, we demonstrate on-demand data distribution and query using publicly accessible database software. These systems support interactive visualizations such that users can explore spectra directly from their browsers. We also offer details that show how the technical concepts in SpExoDisks are implemented, particularly emphasizing sustainability and long-term management of the codebase and processes. Finally, we illustrate the utility that a specialty website can offer to the community by providing a specific example of how the combined spectra from SpExoDisks can enhance our understanding of protoplanetary disks.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce TPCNet, a neural network predictor that combines Convolutional and Transformer architectures with Positional encodings, for neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) spectral analysis. Trained on synthetic datasets, our models predict cold neutral gas fraction ($f_\text{CNM}$) and HI opacity correction factor ($R_\text{HI}$) from emission spectra based on the learned relationships between the desired output parameters and observables (optically-thin column density and peak brightness). As a follow-up to Murray et al. (2020)'s shallow Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we construct deep CNN models and compare them to TPCNet models. TPCNet outperforms deep CNNs, achieving a 10% average increase in testing accuracy, algorithmic (training) stability, and convergence speed. Our findings highlight the robustness of the proposed model with sinusoidal positional encoding applied directly to the spectral input, addressing perturbations in training dataset shuffling and convolutional network weight initializations. Higher spectral resolutions with increased spectral channels offer advantages, albeit with increased training time. Diverse synthetic datasets enhance model performance and generalization, as demonstrated by producing $f_\text{CNM}$ and $R_\text{HI}$ values consistent with evaluation ground truths. Applications of TPCNet to observed emission data reveal strong agreement between the predictions and Gaussian decomposition-based estimates (from emission and absorption surveys), emphasizing its potential in HI spectral analysis.

          Impact of Jupiter's heating and self-shadowing on the Jovian circumplanetary disk structure

 - **Abstract**
 Deciphering the structure of the circumplanetary disk that surrounded Jupiter at the end of its formation is key to understanding how the Galilean moons formed. Three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations have shown that this disk was optically thick and significantly heated to very high temperatures due to the intense radiation emitted by the hot, young planet. Analyzing the impact of Jupiter's radiative heating and shadowing on the structure of the circumplanetary disk can provide valuable insights into the conditions that shaped the formation of the Galilean moons. To assess the impact of Jupiter's radiative heating and shadowing, we have developed a two-dimensional quasi-stationary circumplanetary disk model and used a grey atmosphere radiative transfer method to determine the thermal structure of the disk. We find that the circumplanetary disk self-shadowing has a significant effect, with a temperature drop of approximately 100 K in the shadowed zone compared to the surrounding areas. This shadowed zone, located around 10 Jupiter radii, can act as a cold trap for volatile species such as NH$_3$, CO$_2$ and H$_2$S. The existence of these shadows in Jupiter's circumplanetary disk may have influenced the composition of the building blocks of the Galilean moons, potentially shaping their formation and characteristics. Our study suggests that the thermal structure of Jupiter's circumplanetary disk, particularly the presence of cold traps due to self-shadowing, may have played a crucial role in the formation and composition of the Galilean moons.

          Small and Close-In Planets are Uncommon around A-type Stars

 - **Abstract**
 The Kepler and K2 missions enabled robust calculations of planet occurrence rates around FGKM-type stars. However, these missions observed too few stars with earlier spectral types to tightly constrain the occurrence rates of planets orbiting hotter stars. Using TESS, we calculate the occurrence rate of small ($1 \, R_\oplus < R_{\rm p} < 8 \, R_\oplus$), close-in ($P_{\rm orb} < 10$~days) planets orbiting A-type stars for the first time. We search a sample of 20,257 bright ($6 < T < 10$) A-type stars for transiting planets using a custom pipeline and vet the detected signals, finding no reliable small planets. We characterize the pipeline completeness using injection/recovery tests and determine the $3\sigma$ upper limits of the occurrence rates of close-in sub-Saturns ($4 \, R_\oplus < R_{\rm p} < 8 \, R_\oplus$), sub-Neptunes ($2 \, R_\oplus < R_{\rm p} < 4 \, R_\oplus$), and super-Earths ($1 \, R_\oplus < R_{\rm p} < 2 \, R_\oplus$). We find upper limits of $2.2 \pm 0.4$ sub-Saturns and $9.1 \pm 1.8$ sub-Neptunes per 1000 A-type stars, which may be more than $3\times$ and $6\times$ lower than \textit{Kepler}-era estimates for Sun-like stars. We calculate an upper limit of $186 \pm 34$ super-Earths per 1000 A-type stars, which may be more than $1.5\times$ lower than that for M dwarfs. Our results hint that small, close-in planets become rarer around early-type stars and that their occurrence rates decrease faster than that of hot Jupiters with increasing host star temperature. We discuss plausible explanations for these trends, including star-disk interactions and enhanced photoevaporation of planet atmospheres.

          'Weather' in the LSST Camera: Investigating Patterns in Differenced Flat Images

 - **Abstract**
 During electro-optical testing of the camera for the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, a unique low-signal pattern was found in differenced pairs of flat images used to create photon transfer curves, with peak-to-peak variations of a factor of 10^-3. A turbulent pattern of this amplitude was apparent in many differenced flat-fielded images. The pattern changes from image to image and shares similarities with atmospheric 'weather' turbulence patterns. We applied several strategies to determine the source of the turbulent pattern and found that it is representative of the mixing of the air and index of refraction variations caused by the internal camera purge system displacing air, which we are sensitive to due to our flat field project setup. Characterizing this changing environment with 2-D correlation functions of the 'weather' patterns provides evidence that the images reflect the changes in the camera environment due to the internal camera purge system. Simulations of the full optical system using the galsim and batoid codes show that the weather pattern affects the dispersion of the camera point-spread function at only the one part in 10^-4 level

          Towards a Cosmic-Ray Energy Scale with the Auger Engineering Radio Array

 - **Abstract**
 Radio detection of cosmic-ray (CR) induced extensive air showers with digital antenna arrays is a matured technique by now. At the Pierre Auger Observatory, the Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) has been measuring air-shower signals in conjunction with the particle detectors of the surface detector (SD) for over ten years. For an absolute determination of the CR energy with the Auger baseline detectors, the shower size estimator from the SD is calibrated with the energy scale of the fluorescence detector (FD). However, AERA has an independent access to the energy scale through the reconstructed radio signals. The hybrid detectors at the Pierre Auger Observatory offer the unique opportunity to compare the two independent energy scales. In this contribution, we present our envisaged methodology for cross-checking the agreement between the energy scales of the FD and AERA using hybrid SD-AERA shower data and simulations. We show individual steps of our radio signal reconstruction and highlight the key ingredients for calibrated energy measurements.

          The evolutionary state of the red giant star L$_2$ Puppis
 - **Authors:** S. Uttenthaler

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 Context: L$_2$ Puppis (L$_2$ Pup) is a nearby red giant star and an important object in late-type star research because it has a dust disc and potentially a companion. Aims: L$_2$ Pup is often called the second-closest Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star to the sun, second only to R Doradus. However, whether the star is indeed on the AGB or the Red Giant Branch (RGB) is questionable. We review its evolutionary state. Methods: We analyse high-resolution optical archive spectra to search for absorption lines of the third dredge-up indicator technetium (Tc) in L$_2$~Pup. We also compare the star to a sample of well-known AGB stars in terms of luminosity and pulsation properties and place it in a Gaia-2MASS diagram. Results: L$_2$ Pup is found to be Tc-poor. Thus, it is not undergoing third dredge-up events. The star is fainter than the RGB tip and fainter than all Tc-rich stars in the comparison sample. L$_2$ Pup pulsates in the fundamental mode, similar to Mira variables, but its pulsation properties do not allow us to distinguish between the RGB and AGB stages. Conclusions: In conclusion, L$_2$ Pup could be an RGB or early AGB star, but it is more likely to be an RGB than an AGB star. Our findings are important for a better understanding of the L$_2$ Pup system and its past and future evolution

          Assessing the processes behind planet engulfment and its imprints

 - **Abstract**
 Throughout a planetary system's formation evolution, some of the planetary material may end up falling into the host star and be engulfed by it, leading to a potential variation of the stellar composition. The present study explores how planet engulfment may impact the chemical composition of the stellar surface and discusses what would be the rate of events with an observable imprint, for Sun-like stars. We use data from the NGPPS calculations by the Generation III Bern model to analyse the conditions under which planet engulfment may occur. Additionally, we use stellar models computed with Cesam2k20 to account for how the stellar internal structure and its processes may affect the dilution of the signal caused by planet engulfment. Our results show that there are three different phases associated to different mechanisms under which engulfment events may happen. Moreover, systems that undergo planet engulfment are more likely to come from protoplanetary disks that are more massive and more metal-rich than non-engulfing systems. Engulfment events leading to an observable signal happen after the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk when the convective envelope of the stars becomes thinner. With the stellar convective layer shrinking as the star evolves in the main sequence, they display a higher variation of chemical composition, which also correlates with the amount of engulfed material. By accounting for the physical processes happening in the stellar interior and in the optimistic case of being able to detect variations above 0.02 dex in the stellar composition, we find an engulfment rate no higher than $20\%$ for Sun-like stars that may reveal detectable traces of planet engulfment. Engulfment events that lead to an observable variation of the stellar composition are rare due to the specific conditions required to result in such signatures.

          Accreting Binary Eccentricities follow Predicted Equilibrium Values

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate observations of circumbinary disks (CBD), to find evidence for an equilibrium eccentricity predicted by current binary accretion theory. Although stellar binary demographics in the Milky Way show no evidence for a preferred eccentricity for binary systems, we show that actively accreting systems lie on a predicted equilibrium eccentricity curve. We constrain our sample to only systems that have well defined orbital parameters (e.g,. eccentricity, mass-ratio, inclination angle). We find observations are consistent with theory for stellar binaries that are aligned with the disk and that are separated enough that tidal circularization is negligible. This suggests that eccentricity in these systems evolves after the dissipation of the CBD, given the flat eccentricity distribution of binary systems in the Milky Way.
