 - **Abstract**
 The detectability of the gravitational-wave signal from $r$-modes depends on the interplay between the amplification of the mode by the CFS instability and its damping due to dissipative mechanisms present in the stellar matter. The instability window of $r$-modes describes the region of stellar parameters (angular velocity, $\Omega$, and redshifted stellar temperature, $T^\infty$), for which the mode is unstable. In this study, we reexamine this problem in nonbarotropic neutron stars, taking into account the previously overlooked nonanalytic behavior (in $\Omega$) of relativistic $r$-modes and enhanced energy dissipation resulting from diffusion in superconducting stellar matter. We demonstrate that at slow rotation rates, relativistic $r$-modes exhibit weaker amplification by the CFS instability compared to Newtonian ones. However, their dissipation through viscosity and diffusion is significantly more efficient. In rapidly rotating neutron stars within the framework of general relativity, the amplification of $r$-modes by the CFS mechanism and their damping due to shear viscosity become comparable to those predicted by Newtonian theory. In contrast, the relativistic damping of the mode by diffusion and bulk viscosity remains significantly stronger than in the nonrelativistic case. Consequently, account for diffusion and general relativity leads to a substantial modification of the $r$-mode instability window compared to the Newtonian prediction. This finding is important for the interpretation of observations of rotating neutron stars, as well as for overall understanding of $r$-mode physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Over 4 billion years ago, Earth is thought to have been a hazy world akin to Saturn's moon Titan. The organic hazes in the atmosphere at this time could contain a vast inventory of life's building blocks, and thus may have seeded warm little ponds for life. In this work, we produce organic hazes in the lab in atmospheres with high (5%) and low (0.5%) CH4 abundances and analyze the solid particles for nucleobases, amino acids, and a few other organics using GC/MS/MS to obtain their concentrations. We also analyze heated (200 $^{\circ}$C) samples from the high methane organic haze experiment to simulate these particles sitting on an uninhabitable surface. Finally, we use our experimental results and estimates of atmospheric haze production as inputs for a comprehensive numerical pond model to calculate the concentrations of nucleobases from organic hazes in these environments. We find that organic hazes typically provide up to 0.2-6.5 $\mu$M concentrations of nucleobases to warm little ponds for potentially habitable Hadean conditions. However, without seepage, uracil and thymine can reach ~100 $\mu$M concentrations, which is the present lower experimental limit to react these species to form nucleotides. Heating samples leads to partial or complete decay of biomolecules, suggesting that biomolecule stockpiling on the hot surface is unlikely. The ideal conditions for the delivery of life's building blocks from organic hazes would be when the Hadean atmosphere is rich in methane, but not so rich as to create an uninhabitable surface.
#### Earths are not Super-Earths, Saturns are not Jupiters: Imprints of  pressure-bump planet formation on planetary architectures

 - **Abstract**
 In protoplanetary disks, sufficiently massive planets excite pressure bumps, which can then be preferred locations for forming new planet cores. We discuss how this loop may affect the architecture of multi-planet systems, and compare our predictions with observation. Our main prediction is that low-mass planets and giant planets can each be divided into two subpopulations with different levels of mass uniformity. Low-mass planets that can and cannot reach the pebble isolation mass (the minimum mass required to produce a pressure bump) develop into intra-similar "Super-Earths" and more diverse "Earths", respectively. Gas giants that do and do not accrete envelope quickly develop into intra-similar "Jupiters" and more diverse "Saturns", respectively. Super-Earths prefer to form long chains via repeated pressure-bump planet formation, while Jupiter formation is usually terminated at pairs or triplets due to dynamical instability. These predictions are broadly consistent with observations. In particular, we discover a previously overlooked mass uniformity dichotomy among the observed populations of both low-mass planets (Earths vs. Super-Earths) and gas giants (Saturns vs. Jupiters). For low-mass planets, planets well below the pebble isolation mass ($\lesssim 3M_\oplus$ or $\lesssim 1.5 R_\oplus$ for sun-like stars) show significantly higher intra-system pairwise mass difference than planets around the pebble isolation mass. For gas giants, the period ratios of intra-system pairs show a bimodal distribution, which can be interpreted as two subpopulations with different levels of mass uniformity. These findings suggest that pressure-bump planet formation could be an important ingredient in shaping planetary architectures.
#### Constraining dark energy with the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect

 - **Abstract**
 We use the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, by now detectable at $\sim 5\sigma$ within the context of $\Lambda{}$CDM cosmologies, to place strong constraints on dynamical dark energy theories. Working within an effective field theory framework for dark energy we find that including ISW constraints from galaxy-CMB cross-correlations significantly strengthens existing large-scale structure constraints, yielding bounds consistent with $\Lambda{}$CDM and approximately reducing the viable parameter space by $\sim 70\%$. This is a direct consequence of ${\cal O}(1)$ changes induced in these cross-correlations by otherwise viable dark energy models, which we discuss in detail. We compute constraints by adapting the $\Lambda{}$CDM ISW likelihood from [1] for dynamical dark energy models using galaxy data from 2MASS, WISE $\times$ SuperCOSMOS, SDSS-DR12, QSOs and NVSS, CMB data from Planck 18, and BAO and RSD large scale structure measurements from BOSS and 6dF. We show constraints both in terms of EFT-inspired $\alpha_i$ and phenomenological $\mu/\Sigma$ parametrisations. Furthermore we discuss the approximations involved and related aspects of bias modelling in detail and highlight what these constraints imply for the underlying dark energy theories.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomers have always wanted to know whether there are other planets around other stars that support life like our Earth. The search for life elsewhere has led us to new findings of extreme planetary conditions that humans were unaware of. Here we present the habitability index values of three earlier discovered exoplanets: Kepler-504 b (of the star Kepler-504), Kepler-315 b and Kepler-315 c (of the Kepler-315 stellar system). We wanted to know what are the ideal factors that decide the chances of habitability, e.g., the orbital distance from the star, the type of star, or a combination of multiple properties. We hypothesized that there should exist a combination of these properties that will increase the chances that the exoplanet would be similar to Earth. We have adopted the Earth Similarity Index (ESI) for calculating the physical similarity of exoplanets to Earth, and hence the probability of them being habitable. Using available telescope data, we found that Kepler-504 b, with a host M-type star (small red dwarf), and Kepler-315 c, with a host G-type star, had ESI values of 71.23% and 69.44%, respectively, thereby showing high similarity to Earth. Kepler-315 b, with a host G-type star, on the other hand, had an ESI value of only 35.68%, showing poor similarity to Earth. We have also listed previously calculated ESI values of additional exoplanets from the Planet Habitability Laboratory catalog, which supports our hypothesis. Thus, it suggests that a combination of star-type and orbital radius seems to make conditions favorable. Future work can study more exoplanets with such combinations to further validate these findings.

 - **Abstract**
 GJ 9827 is a bright, nearby K7V star orbited by two super-Earths and one mini-Neptune on close-in orbits. The system was first discovered using K2 data and then further characterized by other spectroscopic and photometric instruments. Previous literature studies provide several mass measurements for the three planets, however, with large variations and uncertainties. To better constrain the planetary masses, we added high-precision radial velocity measurements from ESPRESSO to published datasets from HARPS, HARPS-N, and HIRES and we performed a Gaussian process analysis combining radial velocity and photometric datasets from K2 and TESS. This method allowed us to model the stellar activity signal and derive precise planetary parameters. We determined planetary masses of $M_b = 4.28_{-0.33}^{+0.35}$ M${_\oplus}$, $M_c = 1.86_{-0.39}^{+0.37}$ M${_\oplus}$, and $M_d = 3.02_{-0.57}^{+0.58}$ M${_\oplus}$, and orbital periods of $1.208974 \pm 0.000001$ days for planet b, $3.648103_{-0.000010}^{+0.000013}$ days for planet c, and $6.201812 \pm 0.000009$ days for planet d. We compared our results to literature values and found that our derived uncertainties for the planetary mass, period, and radial velocity amplitude are smaller than the previously determined uncertainties. We modeled the interior composition of the three planets using the machine-learning-based tool ExoMDN and conclude that GJ 9827 b and c have an Earth-like composition, whereas GJ 9827 d has an hydrogen envelope, which, together with its density, places it in the mini-Neptune regime.

 - **Abstract**
 A dust nucleating agent may be present in interstellar or circumstellar media that has gone seemingly undetected and unstudied for decades. Some analyses of the Murchison CM2 meteorite suggest that at least some of the aluminum present within condensed as aluminum nitrides instead of the long studied, but heretofore undetected suite of aluminum oxides. The present theoretical study utilizes explicitly correlated coupled cluster theory and density functional theory to provide a pathway of formation from alane (AlH$_3$) and ammonia to the cyclic structure, Al$_2$N$_2$H$_4$ which has the proper Al/N ratio expected of bulk aluminum nitrides. Novel rovibrational spectroscopic constants are computed for alane and the first two formed structures, AlNH$_6$ and AlNH$_4$, along the reaction pathway for use as reference in possible laboratory or observational studies. The $\nu_8$ bending frequency for AlNH$_6$ at 755.7 cm$^{-1}$ (13.23 $\mu$m) presents a vibrational transition intensity of 515 km mol$^{-1}$, slightly more intense than the anti-symmetric C$-$O stretch of carbon dioxide, and contains a dipole moment of 5.40 D, which is $\sim 3 \times$ larger than that of water. Thus, the present reaction pathway and rovibrational spectroscopic analysis may potentially assist in the astrophysical detection of novel, inorganic species which may be indicative of larger dust grain nucleation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present emission maps (1.5'$\times$1.5' scale, corresponding to 0.18 pc) of the DCN ($J=2-1$) and DCO$^+$ ($J=2-1$) lines in the 2 mm band toward the Orion KL region obtained with the 2 mm receiver system named B4R installed on the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT). The DCN emission shows a peak at the Orion KL hot core position, whereas no DCO$^+$ emission has been detected there. The DCO$^+$ emission shows enhancement at the west side of the hot core, which is well shielded from the UV radiation from OB massive stars in the Trapezium cluster. We have derived the abundance ratio of DCN/DCO$^+$ at three representative positions where both species have been detected. The gas components with $V_{\rm {LSR}} \approx 7.5-8.7$ km/s are associated with low abundance ratios of $\sim4-6$, whereas much higher abundance ratios ($\sim22-30$) are derived for the gas components with $V_{\rm {LSR}} \approx 9.2-11.6$ km/s. We have compared the observed abundance ratio to our chemical models and found that the observed differences in the DCN/DCO$^+$ abundance ratios are explained by different densities.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectral fitting of X-ray data usually involves minimizing statistics like the chi-square and the Cash statistic. Here we discuss their limitations and introduce two measures based on the cumulative sum (CuSum) of model residuals to evaluate whether model complexity could be increased: the percentage of bins exceeding a nominal threshold in a CuSum array (pct$_{CuSum}$), and the excess area under the CuSum compared to the nominal (p$_\textit{area}$). We demonstrate their use with an application to a $\textit{Chandra}$ ACIS spectral fit.

 - **Abstract**
 Refractory inclusions in chondritic meteorites, namely amoeboid olivine aggregates (AOAs) and Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs), are among the first solids to have formed in the solar system. The isotopic composition of CAIs is distinct from bulk meteorites, which either results from extreme processing of presolar carriers in the CAI-forming region, or reflects an inherited heterogeneity from the Sun's parental molecular cloud. Amoeboid olivine aggregates are less refractory than CAIs and provide a record of how the isotopic composition of solid material in the disk may have changed in time and space. However, the isotopic composition of AOAs and how this composition relates to that of CAIs and later-formed solids is unknown. Here, using new O, Ti, and Cr isotopic data for eight AOAs from the Allende CV3 chondrite, we show that CAIs and AOAs share a common isotopic composition, indicating a close genetic link and formation from the same isotopic reservoir. Because AOAs are less refractory than CAIs, this observation is difficult to reconcile with a thermal processing origin of the isotope anomalies. Instead, the common isotopic composition of CAIs and AOAs is readily accounted for in a model in which the isotopic composition of infalling material from the Sun's parental molecular cloud changed over time. In this model, CAIs and AOAs record the isotopic composition of the early infall, while later-formed solids contain a larger fraction of the later, isotopically distinct infall. This model implies that CAIs and AOAs record the isotopic composition of the Sun and suggests that the nucleosynthetic isotope heterogeneity of the solar system is predominantly produced by mixing of solar nebula condensates, which acquired their distinct isotopic compositions as a result of time-varied infall from the protosolar cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 1 (EUSO-SPB1) was launched in 2017 April from Wanaka, New Zealand. The plan of this mission of opportunity on a NASA super pressure balloon test flight was to circle the southern hemisphere. The primary scientific goal was to make the first observations of ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray extensive air showers (EASs) by looking down on the atmosphere with an ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence telescope from suborbital altitude (33~km). After 12~days and 4~hours aloft, the flight was terminated prematurely in the Pacific Ocean. Before the flight, the instrument was tested extensively in the West Desert of Utah, USA, with UV point sources and lasers. The test results indicated that the instrument had sensitivity to EASs of approximately 3 EeV. Simulations of the telescope system, telescope on time, and realized flight trajectory predicted an observation of about 1 event assuming clear sky conditions. The effects of high clouds were estimated to reduce this value by approximately a factor of 2. A manual search and a machine-learning-based search did not find any EAS signals in these data. Here we review the EUSO-SPB1 instrument and flight and the EAS search.
#### Observations of high-order multiplicity in a high-mass stellar  protocluster

 - **Abstract**
 The dominant mechanism forming multiple stellar systems in the high-mass regime (M$_\ast \gtrsim $ 8 $M_{\odot}$) remained unknown because direct imaging of multiple protostellar systems at early phases of high-mass star formation is very challenging. High-mass stars are expected to form in clustered environments containing binaries and higher-order multiplicity systems. So far only a few high-mass protobinary systems, and no definitive higher-order multiples, have been detected. Here we report the discovery of one quintuple, one quadruple, one triple and four binary protostellar systems simultaneously forming in a single high-mass protocluster, G333.23--0.06, using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array high-resolution observations. We present a new example of a group of gravitationally bound binary and higher-order multiples during their early formation phases in a protocluster. This provides the clearest direct measurement of the initial configuration of primordial high-order multiple systems, with implications for the in situ multiplicity and its origin. We find that the binary and higher-order multiple systems, and their parent cores, show no obvious sign of disk-like kinematic structure. We conclude that the observed fragmentation into binary and higher-order multiple systems can be explained by core fragmentation, indicating its crucial role in establishing the multiplicity during high-mass star cluster formation.
#### Heat loss and internal dynamics of Venus from global surface heat flow  estimates

 - **Abstract**
 The absence of plate tectonics and the young surface age (0.3-1 billion years) of Venus have led to diverse geodynamic models for Venus. The energetics of the Venusian interior drive these models; however, the lack of direct constraints on surface heat flow hampers their quantitative assessment. Here we present the first global heat flow map for Venus, obtained from an inversion of geophysical data, including crustal thickness, effective elastic thickness, and radioactive heat production. Heat flow on Venus is lower and less geographically structured than on Earth but with highs reaching values typical of magmatically active terrestrial areas. The obtained total heat loss is 11-14.5 TW, similar to estimates of the total radioactive heat production. Therefore, at present, Venus proportionally dissipates much less heat than Earth. Furthermore, the calculated crustal temperatures imply that crustal melting or eclogitization are not dominant in the Venusian crust.

 - **Abstract**
 While small, Neptune-like planets are among the most abundant exoplanets, our understanding of their atmospheric structure and dynamics remains sparse. In particular, many unknowns remain on the way moist convection works in these atmospheres where condensable species are heavier than the non-condensable background gas. While it has been predicted that moist convection could shut-down above some threshold abundance of these condensable species, this prediction is based on simple linear analysis and relies on strong assumptions on the saturation of the atmosphere. To investigate this issue, we develop a 3D cloud resolving model for H2 atmospheres with large amounts of condensable species and apply this model to a prototypical temperate Neptune-like planet -- K2-18b. Our model confirms the shut-down of moist convection and the onset of a stably stratified layer in the atmosphere, leading to much hotter deep atmospheres and interiors. Our 3D simulations further provide quantitative estimates of the turbulent mixing in this stable layer, which is a key driver of the cycling of condensables in the atmosphere. This allows us to build a very simple, yet realistic 1D model that captures the most salient features of the structure of Neptune-like atmospheres. Our qualitative findings on the behavior of moist convection in hydrogen atmospheres go beyond temperate planets and should also apply to the regions where iron and silicates condense in the deep interior of H2-dominated planets. Finally, we use our model to investigate the likelihood of a liquid ocean beneath a H2 dominated atmosphere on K2-18b. We find that the planet would need to have a very high albedo (>0.5-0.6) to sustain a liquid ocean. However, due to the spectral type of the star, the amount of aerosol scattering that would be needed to provide such a high albedo is inconsistent with the latest observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Sunlight scattered from the surface of an airless body is generally partially polarized, and the corresponding polarization state includes information about the scattering surface, such as albedo, surface grain sizes, composition, and taxonomic types. Aims. We conducted polarimetry of two large airless bodies, the Dawn mission targets (1) Ceres and (4) Vesta, in the near-infrared region. We further investigated the change in the polarimetric phase curves over the wavelengths expected from previous works. Methods. We used the Nishiharima Infrared Camera (NIC) installed at the Nishi-Harima Astronomical Observatory (NHAO) to observe these objects at multiple geometric configurations in the J, H, and $\mathrm{K_s}$ bands ($ \lambda \sim 1.2\mathrm{-}2.3 \mathrm{\mu m} $). Results. Polarimetric parameters were determined and compared with previously reported experimental results. In particular, Vesta exhibits a characteristic change in the negative polarization branch as the wavelength increases to the $\mathrm{K_s}$ band, which we interpret as an indication of the dominant existence of $D \sim 10\mathrm{-}20 \mathrm{\mu m}$ particles. Our approach is supported by empirical reasoning and coincides well with an independent, theory-driven approach based on thermal modeling. Conclusions. This work demonstrates how near-infrared polarimetry can be utilized to quantitatively determine the particle size of airless objects. This finding will have important implications for asteroid taxonomy and regolith evolution.
#### Near-Ultraviolet Radiation toward Molecular Cloud N4 in W 50/SS 433:  Evidence for Direct Interaction of the Jet with Molecular Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 We compared the molecular clouds in the western part of SS 433 with near-ultraviolet radiation data obtained from GALEX. Near-ultraviolet radiation is prominently confirmed toward only N4, while no near-ultraviolet radiation is detected toward N1, N2, and N3. The radiative region of near-ultraviolet radiation is nearly the same as the CO-emitting region in N4, and does not extend beyond the jet seen in X-ray radiation. Near-ultraviolet radiation cannot be explained solely by broadband continuous radiation and may originate from line emissions. The intensity of near-ultraviolet radiation exhibits an anti-correlation with that of 13CO(J=3-2) emission. This anti-correlation, along with strong far-infrared radiation in the region with weaker near-ultraviolet radiation intensity compared to its surroundings, suggests that near-ultraviolet radiation originates from behind the molecular cloud, heating up the interstellar dust in N4. Subsequently, the dust in N4 re-radiates in the far-infrared band. In the same region, a high peak T_MB ratio of 12CO(J=3-2)/12CO(J=1-0) of ~0.9, and a high kinetic temperature of T_k ~56 K in the molecular cloud indicate that CO molecules are highly excited, and the molecular cloud is heated through photoelectric heating. This heating results from electrons released due to the photoelectric effect caused by the phenomenon where interstellar dust absorbs near-ultraviolet radiation. In terms of the timescale of near-ultraviolet radiation originating from line emissions, near-ultraviolet radiation towards N4 cannot be explained by the shock of the blast wave from a supernova that created W 50. These findings also suggest that N4 directly interacts with the jet from SS 433. As a result of this direct interaction, near-ultraviolet radiation is emitted from an interacting layer between the jet and N4.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct one-dimensional stellar-evolution simulations of stars with zero age main sequence masses of $M_{ZAMS} = 8.8-9.45 M_\odot$ towards core collapse by electron capture, and find that the convective zone of the pre-collapse core can supply the required stochastic angular momentum fluctuations to set a jet-driven electron capture supernova (ECSN) explosion in the frame of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). By our criteria of minimum convective specific angular momentum and an accreted mass during jet-launching of $M_{acc} \simeq 0.001-0.01 M_\odot$, the layer in the convective zone that when accreted launches the exploding jittering jets resides in the helium-rich zone. This exploding layer is accreted at about a minute to a few hours, depending on the model, after core collapse occurs, much shorter than the time the exploding shock crosses the star. The final (gravitational) mass of the neutron star (NS) remnant is in the range of $M_{NS} =1.25-1.43 M_\odot$. Our results add to the growing support of the JJEM as the main explosion mechanism of massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Pre-main sequence disk accretion is pivotal in determining the final stellar properties and the early conditions for close-in planets. We aim to establish the impact of internal (stellar mass) and external (radiation field) parameters on disk evolution in the Lagoon Nebula massive star-forming region. We employ simultaneous $u,g,r,i,H\alpha$ time series photometry, archival infrared data, and high-precision $K2$ light curves, to derive stellar, disk, and accretion properties for 1012 Lagoon Nebula members. Of all young stars in the Lagoon Nebula, we estimate $34\%-37\%$ have inner disks traceable down to $\sim 12$ $\mu$m, while $38\%-41\%$ are actively accreting. We detect disks $\sim$1.5 times more frequently around G/K/M stars than higher-mass stars, which appear to deplete their inner disks on shorter timescales. We find tentative evidence for faster disk evolution in the central regions of the Lagoon Nebula, where the bulk of the O/B population is located. Conversely, disks appear to last longer at its outskirts, where the measured fraction of disk-bearing stars tends to exceed those of accreting and disk-free stars. The derived mass accretion rates show a non-uniform dependence on stellar mass between $\sim 0.2-5$ $M_\odot$. In addition, the typical accretion rates appear to differ across the Lagoon Nebula extension, with values two times lower in the core region than at its periphery. Finally, we detect tentative density gradients in the accretion shocks, with lags in the appearance of brightness features as a function of wavelength that can amount to $\sim7\%-30\%$ of the rotation period.
