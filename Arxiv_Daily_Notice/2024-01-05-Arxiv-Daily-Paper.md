 - **Abstract**
 We explore the potential of enhancing LLM performance in astronomy-focused question-answering through targeted, continual pre-training. By employing a compact 7B-parameter LLaMA-2 model and focusing exclusively on a curated set of astronomy corpus -- comprising abstracts, introductions, and conclusions -- we achieve notable improvements in specialized topic comprehension. While general LLMs like GPT-4 outperform in broader question-answering scenarios due to superior reasoning capabilities, our findings suggest that continual pre-training with limited resources can still enhance model performance on specialized topics. Additionally, we present an extension of AstroLLaMA: the fine-tuning of the 7B LLaMA model on a domain-specific conversational dataset, culminating in the release of the chat-enabled AstroLLaMA for community use. Comprehensive quantitative benchmarking is currently in progress and will be detailed in an upcoming full paper. The model, AstroLLaMA-Chat, is now available at https://huggingface.co/universeTBD, providing the first open-source conversational AI tool tailored for the astronomy community.

 - **Abstract**
 We developed a tool that measures equivalent widths of various lines in low resolution optical spectra, and it was applied to stellar spectra obtained as part of SDSS-V and LAMOST programs. These lines, such as Li I which directly indicates stellar youth, or optical H I and Ca II which in emission indicate activity associated with stellar youth, are commonly seen in YSOs. We observe several notable differences in the properties of these lines between YSOs and the field stars. Using these data, we devise a set of criteria through which it is possible to confirm the youth of stars that have been observed by the ABYSS program, as well as to identify likely young stars that have serendipitously been observed by other programs. We examine the decrement of H lines seen in emission in CTTSs, and estimate the properties of the accretion stream that is responsible for the production of these lines. Finally, we examine the evolution of Li I as a function of age, and characterize the scatter in its abundance that appears to be intrinsic in young M dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 Detection of redshifted \ion{H}{i} 21cm emission is a potential probe for investigating the Universe's first billion years. However, given the significantly brighter foreground, detecting 21cm is observationally difficult. The Earth's ionosphere considerably distorts the signal at low frequencies by introducing directional-dependent effects. Here, for the first time, we report the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to extract the global 21cm signal characteristics from the composite all-sky averaged signal, including foreground and ionospheric effects such as refraction, absorption, and thermal emission from the ionosphere's F and D-layers. We assume a 'perfect' instrument and neglect instrumental calibration and beam effects. To model the ionospheric effect, we considered the static and time-varying ionospheric conditions for the mid-latitude region where LOFAR is situated. In this work, we trained the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for various situations using a synthetic set of the global 21cm signals created by altering its parameter space based on the "$\rm \tanh$" parameterized model and the Accelerated Reionization Era Simulations (ARES) algorithm. The obtained result shows that the ANN model can extract the global signal parameters with an accuracy of $\ge 96 \% $ in the final study when we include foreground and ionospheric effects. On the other hand, a similar ANN model can extract the signal parameters from the final prediction dataset with an accuracy ranging from $97 \%$ to $98 \%$ when considering more realistic sets of the global 21cm signals based on physical models.
#### Chaos in Inhomogeneous Neutrino Fast Flavor Instability

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01936
 - **Abstract**
 In dense neutrino gases, the neutrino-neutrino coherent forward scattering gives rise to a complex flavor oscillation phenomenon not fully incorporated in simulations of neutron star mergers (NSM) and core collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Moreover, it has been proposed to be chaotic, potentially limiting our ability to predict neutrino flavor transformations in simulations. To address this issue, we explore how small flavor perturbations evolve within a narrow centimeter-scale region inside a NSM and a toy neutrino distribution. Our findings reveal that paths in the flavor state space of solutions with similar initial conditions diverge exponentially, exhibiting chaos. This inherent chaos makes the microscopic scales of neutrino flavor transformations unpredictable. However, the domain-averaged neutrino density matrix remains relatively stable, with chaos minimally affecting it. This particular property suggests that domain-averaged quantities remain reliable despite the exponential amplification of errors.

 - **Abstract**
 The AO327 drift survey for radio pulsars and transients used the Arecibo telescope from 2010 until its collapse in 2020. AO327 collected ~3100 hours of data at 327 MHz with a time resolution of 82 us and frequency resolution of 24 kHz. While the main motivation for such surveys is the discovery of new pulsars and new, even unforeseen, types of radio transients, they also serendipitously collect a wealth of data on known pulsars. We present an electronic catalog of data and data products on 206 pulsars whose periodic emission was detected by AO327 and are listed in the ATNF catalog of all published pulsars. The AO327 data products include dedispersed time series at full time resolution, average ("folded") pulse profiles, Gaussian pulse profile templates, and an absolute phase reference that allows phase-aligning the AO327 pulse profiles in a physically meaningful manner with profiles from data taken with other instruments. We also provide machine-readable tables with uncalibrated flux measurements at 327 MHz and pulse widths at 50% and 10% of the pulse peak determined from the fitted Gaussian profile templates. The AO327 catalog data set can be used in applications like population analysis of radio pulsars, pulse profile evolution studies in time and frequency, cone and core emission of the pulsar beam, scintillation, pulse intensity distributions, and others. It also constitutes a ready-made resource for teaching signal processing and pulsar astronomy techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 As a potential candidate for the late-time accelerating expansion of the Universe, the Chaplygin gas and its generalized models have significant implications to modern cosmology. In this work we investigate the effects of dark energy on the internal structure of a neutron star composed of two phases, which leads us to wonder: Do stable neutron stars have a dark-energy core? To address this question, we focus on the radial stability of stellar configurations composed by a dark-energy core -- described by a Chaplygin-type equation of state (EoS) -- and an ordinary-matter external layer which is described by a polytropic EoS. We examine the impact of the rate of energy densities at the phase-splitting surface, defined as $\alpha= \rho_{\rm dis}^-/\rho_{\rm dis}^+$, on the radius, total gravitational mass and oscillation spectrum. The resulting mass-radius diagrams are notably different from dark energy stars without a common-matter crust. Specifically, it is found that both the mass and the radius of the maximum-mass configuration decrease as $\alpha$ becomes smaller. Furthermore, our theoretical predictions for mass-radius relations consistently describe the observational measurements of different massive millisecond pulsars as well as the central compact object within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347. The analysis of the normal oscillation modes reveals that there are two regions of instability on the $M(\rho_c)$ curve when $\alpha$ is small enough indicating that the usual stability criterion $dM/d\rho_c>0$ still holds for rapid phase transitions. However, this is no longer true for the case of slow transitions.

 - **Abstract**
 The US National Gemini Office (US NGO), part of the Community Science and Data Center (CSDC) at NSF's NOIRLab, has completed a project to upgrade the IRAF-based Gemini reduction software to provide a fully supported system capable of running natively on modern hardware. This work includes 64-bit platform ports of the GEMINI package and dependency tasks (e.g. from the STSDAS external package), upgrades to the core IRAF system and all other external packages to fix any platform and licensing problems, and the establishment of fully supported Help Desk and distribution systems for the user community. Early results show a 10-20X speedup of execution times using the native 64-bit software compared to the virtualized 32-bit solutions now in use. Results are even better on new Apple M1/M2 platforms where the additional overhead of Intel CPU emulation can be eliminated. Timing comparisons, science verification testing, and release plans are discussed.
#### Surveying the Giant HII Regions of the Milky Way with SOFIA: VI. NGC  3603

 - **Abstract**
 We present our sixth set of results from our mid-infrared imaging survey of Milky Way Giant HII regions with our detailed analysis of NGC 3603, the most luminous GHII region in the Galaxy. We used imaging data from the FORCAST instrument on the Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) at 20 and 37 microns which mapped the central ~8.5'x8.5' infrared-emitting area of NGC 3603 at a spatial resolution of <~3". Utilizing these SOFIA data in conjunction with multi-wavelength observations from the near-infrared to radio, including Spitzer-IRAC and Herschel-PACS archival data, we investigate the physical nature of individual infrared sources and sub-components within NGC 3603. For individual compact sources we used the multi-wavelength photometry data to construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and fit them with massive young stellar object (MYSO) SED models, and find 14 sources that are likely to be MYSOs. We also detect dust emission from the 3 massive proplyd candidates, as well as from the disk and outflow of the evolved blue supergiant, Sher 25. Utilizing multi-wavelength data, we derived luminosity-to-mass ratio and virial parameters for the star-forming clumps within NGC 3603, estimating their relative ages and finding that NGC 3603 is an older GHII region overall, compared to our previously studied GHII regions. We discuss how NGC 3603, which we categorize as a 'cavity-type' GHII region, exhibits a more modest number of MYSOs and molecular clumps when compared to the 'distributed-type' GHII regions that share similar Lyman continuum photon rates.

 - **Abstract**
 In this research, we investigate the structural evolution of the cosmic web, employing advanced methodologies from Topological Data Analysis. Our approach involves leveraging $Persistence$ $Signals$, an innovative method from recent literature that facilitates the embedding of persistence diagrams into vector spaces by re-conceptualizing them as signals in $\mathbb R^2_+$. Utilizing this methodology, we analyze three quintessential cosmic structures: clusters, filaments, and voids. A central discovery is the correlation between $Persistence$ $Energy$ and redshift values, linking persistent homology with cosmic evolution and providing insights into the dynamics of cosmic structures.

 - **Abstract**
 An inner component misaligned from an outer component in a protoplanetary disk can result in the former casting shadows on the latter. We present a new instance of shadowing on the outer disk around a very low mass star, ZZ~Tau~IRS. Through the analysis of near-infrared (NIR) archival data at $\lambda=1.6$~$\mu$m acquired with the Wide Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope, we identified brightness asymmetries in the top and bottom halves of the highly inclined outer disk, separated by a dark lane. The brighter sides in the top and bottom halves are on the opposite sides, which we attributed to shadows cast by a misaligned inner disk. Radiative transfer modeling of the system with a misaligned angle of 15~deg between the inner and outer disks well reproduced the observations. Additionally, we found an elevated brightness temperature of $^{12}$CO~(3-2) at $r\sim30$~au on the brighter side in NIR wavelengths in the top half disk, which can be explained by the shadowing effect too. While the origin of the misaligned inner disk remains unclear, future monitoring observations to search for temporal variations in brightness asymmetries will likely provide useful clues.

 - **Abstract**
 Utilizing astrometric parameters sourced from \textit{Gaia} Data Release 3 and radial velocities obtained from various spectroscopic surveys, we identify 519 high-velocity stars (HiVels) with a total velocity in the Galactocentric restframe greater than 70\% of their local escape velocity under the {\tt\string Gala} {\tt\string MilkyWayPotential}. Our analysis reveals that the majority of these HiVels are metal-poor late-type giants, and we show 9 HiVels that are unbound candidates to the Galaxy with escape probabilities of 50\%. To investigate the origins of these HiVels, we classify them into four categories and consider the impact of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) potential on their backward-integration trajectories. Specifically, we find that one of the HiVels can track back to the Galactic Center, and three HiVels may originate from the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph). Furthermore, some HiVels appear to be ejected from the Galactic disk, while others formed within the Milky Way or have an extragalactic origin. Given that the LMC has a significant impact on the orbits of Sgr dSph, we examine the reported HiVels that originate from the Sgr dSph, with a few of them passing within the half-light radius of the Sgr dSph.

 - **Abstract**
 The Habitable Worlds Observatory will attempt to image Earth-sized planets in Habitable Zone orbits around nearby Sun-like stars. In this work we explore approximate analytic yield calculations for a future flagship direct imaging mission for a survey sample of uniformly distributed set of identical Sun-like stars. We consider the dependence of this exoplanet detection yield on factors such as eta_Earth, telescope diameter, total on-sky time, orbital phase and separation, inner working angle, flux contrast, desired signal-to-noise ratio, spectral resolution, and other factors. We consider the impact on yield and survey efficiency in the absence of and with precursor knowledge of the Earth-size analog exoplanets. In particular, for precursor knowledge we assume the exoplanet orbital phase at the time of observation can be optimized so as to only image the Earth-size analog exoplanet when it is outside the inner working angle. We find that the yield of flagship direct imaging missions such as Habitable Worlds Observatory will be inner-working angle limited for the estimated exoplanet yields, and will not be impacted by precursor knowledge given our assumptions presented herein. However, we find that the survey efficiency will be enhanced by precursor knowledge. We benchmark our analytic approximations against detailed simulations for coronagraphs and starshades carried out for the HabEx and LUVOIR missions concept studies, and find consistent conclusions. Our analytic relations thus provide quick estimates and derivatives of the impact of key mission parameter choices on exo-Earth yield when considering design trades that can supplement existing computational simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 In this White Paper, we present recommendations for the scientific community and funding agencies to foster the infrastructure for a collaborative multi-messenger and time-domain astronomy (MMA/TDA) ecosystem. MMA/TDA is poised for breakthrough discoveries in the coming decade. In much the same way that expanding beyond the optical bandpass revealed entirely new and unexpected discoveries, cosmic messengers beyond light (i.e., gravitational waves, neutrinos, and cosmic rays) open entirely new windows to answer some of the most fundamental questions in (astro)physics: heavy element synthesis, equation of state of dense matter, particle acceleration, etc. This field was prioritized as a frontier scientific pursuit in the 2020 Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics via its "New Windows on the Dynamic Universe" theme. MMA/TDA science presents technical challenges distinct from those experienced in other disciplines. Successful observations require coordination across myriad boundaries -- different cosmic messengers, ground vs. space, international borders, etc. -- all for sources that may not be well localized, and whose brightness may be changing rapidly with time. Add that all of this work is undertaken by real human beings, with distinct backgrounds, experiences, cultures, and expectations, that often conflict. To address these challenges and help MMA/TDA realize its full scientific potential in the coming decade (and beyond), the second in a series of community workshops sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and NASA titled "Windows on the Universe: Establishing the Infrastructure for a Collaborative Multi-Messenger Ecosystem" was held on October 16-18, 2023 in Tucson, AZ. Here we present the primary recommendations from this workshop focused on three key topics -- hardware, software, and people and policy. [abridged]
#### Dust and Volatiles in the Disintegrating Comet C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS)

 - **Abstract**
 C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) is an Oort cloud comet with an orbital period of $\sim$5895$\,{\rm yr}$. Starting in March 2020, its nucleus underwent disintegration. In order to investigate the gas and dust properties of C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) during its disintegration, we obtained long-slit spectra at 3600--8700$\,{\rm\mathring{A}}$ and $BVRI$ multi-band images with the Xinglong 2.16-Meter Telescope in April 2020. Our observations revealed that C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) exhibited strong emission bands of CN, C$_2$, C$_3$, and NH$_2$ which are superimposed on a dust scattering continuum, typical of cometary spectra in the optical. The production rates of CN, C$_2$, and C$_3$ derived using the Haser model and the corresponding C$_2$/CN and C$_3$/CN ratios suggest that C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) is a ``typical'' Oort cloud comet under the A'Hearn classification, although it appears less dusty as revealed by the $Af\rho$ quantities. Its dust-scattering reflectivity is slightly red, with a gradient of $\sim$5% per $10^3\,{\rm\mathring{A}}$. We model the reflectivity gradient in terms of porous dust and find that the red color is accounted for by porous dust.
#### Multiple power-law tails in the density and column-density distribution  in contracting star-forming clumps

 - **Abstract**
 We present a numerical study of the evolution of power-law tails (PLTs) in the (column-)density distributions ($N$-PDF, $\rho$-PDF) in contracting star-forming clumps in primordial gas, without and with some initial rotational and/or turbulent support. In all considered runs multiple PLTs emerge shortly after the formation of the first protostar. The first PLT (PLT 1) in the $\rho$-PDF is a stable feature with slope $q_1\simeq -1.3$ which corresponds -- under the condition of preserved spherical symmetry -- to the outer envelope of the protostellar object with density profile $\rho\propto l^{-2}$ in the classical Larson-Penston collapse model, where $l$ is the radius. The second PLT (PLT 2) in the $\rho$-PDF is stable in the pure-infall runs but fluctuates significantly in the runs with initial support against gravity as dozens of protostars form and their mutual tidal forces change the density structure. Its mean slope, $\langle q_2\rangle\simeq -2$, corresponds to a density profile of $\rho\propto l^{-3/2}$ which describes a core in free fall in the classical Larson-Penston collapse model or an attractor solution at scales with dominating protostellar gravity. PLT 1 and PLT 2 in the $N$-PDFs are generally consistent with the observational data of Galactic low-mass star-forming regions from {\it Herschel} data. In the runs with initial support against gravity a third PLT (PLT~3) in the $\rho$-PDFs appears simultaneously with or after the emergence of PLT 2. It is very shallow, with mean slope of $\langle q_3\rangle\simeq -1$, and is associated with the formation of thin protostellar accretion disks.
#### Detection and characterisation of icy cavities on the nucleus of comet  67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the detection of three icy cavities on the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. They were identified on high-resolution anaglyphs built from images acquired by the OSIRIS instrument aboard the Rosetta spacecraft on 2016 April 9-10. Visually, they appear as bright patches of typically 15 to 30 m across whose large reflectances and spectral slopes in the visible substantiate the presence of sub-surface water ice. Using a new high-resolution photogrammetric shape model we determined the three-dimensional shape of these cavities whose depth ranges from 20 to 47 m. Spectral slopes were interpreted with models combining water ice and refractory dark material and the water ice abundances in the cavities were found to amount to a few per cent. The determination of the lifetime of the icy cavities was strongly biased by the availability of appropriate and favourable observations, but we found evidences of values of up to two years. The icy cavities were found to be connected to jets well documented in past studies. A thermal model allowed us to track their solar insolation over a large part of the orbit of the comet and a transitory bright jet on 2015 July 18 was unambiguously linked to the brief illumination of the icy bottom of one of the three cavities. These cavities are likely to be the first potential subsurface access points detected on a cometary nucleus and their lifetimes suggest that they reveal pristine sub-surface icy layers or pockets rather than recently recondensed water vapor.
#### NGC 2403 XMM4: evidence for a super-Eddington neutron star with a  possible transient pulsation

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the X-ray source NGC 2403 XMM4 (4XMM J073702.2+653934) based on 20 years of archival observations with XMM-Newton, Chandra, Swift and NuSTAR. Although it has previously been classified as an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX), we show that its luminosity rarely, if ever, passes the $10^{39} \rm ~erg~s^{-1}$ threshold luminosity for a ULX. It does, however, behave very similarly to ULXs, with its 0.3-10 keV spectra well described by two thermal components, the softer of which behaves consistently with the expectations for an advection-dominated disc ($L\propto T^{1.49\pm0.85}$), and we find tentative evidence for an extra spectral component above 10 keV. We also find moderately significant evidence for an absorption feature in one spectrum that could originate in an outflowing wind, although a cyclotron resonance scattering feature is also a possibility. Most intriguingly, we find a possible transient pulsation at $\sim 3.32$ Hz in a short segment of one observation using an accelerated pulsation search. This evidence suggests that NGC 2403 XMM4 is displaying many of the hallmarks of super-Eddington accretion at luminosities between $5 - 10 \times 10^{38} \rm ~erg~s^{-1}$ which, when considered alongside the putative pulsation, points to the presence of a neutron star as the accreting object this system.

 To date, the hot Jupiter WASP-12 b has been the only planet with confirmed orbital decay. The late F-type host star has been hypothesized to be surrounded by a large structure of circumstellar material evaporated from the planet. We obtained two high-resolution spectral transit time series with CARMENES and extensively searched for absorption signals by the atomic species Na, H, Ca, and He using transmission spectroscopy, thereby covering the He I triplet with high resolution for the first time. We apply SYSREM for atomic line transmission spectroscopy, introduce the technique of signal protection to improve the results for individual absorption lines, and compare the outcomes to those of established methods. No transmission signals were detected and the most stringent upper limits as of yet were derived for the individual indicators. Nonetheless, we found variation in the stellar Halpha and He I lines, the origin of which remains uncertain but is unlikely to be activity. To constrain the enigmatic activity state of WASP-12, we analyzed XMM-Newton X-ray data and found the star to be moderately active at most. We deduced an upper limit for the X-ray luminosity and the irradiating X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) flux of WASP-12 b. Based on the XUV flux upper limit and the lack of the He I signal, our hydrodynamic models slightly favor a moderately irradiated planet with a thermospheric temperature of <= 12,000 K, and a conservative upper limit of <= 4e12 g/s on the mass-loss rate. Our study does not provide evidence for an extended planetary atmosphere or absorption by circumstellar material close to the planetary orbit.

 Recent astrophysical mass inferences of compact stars (CSs) HESS J1731-347 and PSR J0952-0607, with extremely small and large masses respectively, as well as the measurement of the neutron skin of Ca in the CREX experiment challenge and constrain the models of dense matter. In this work, we examine the concept of hybrid stars - objects containing quark cores surrounded by nucleonic envelopes - as models that account for these new data along with other (multimessenger) inferences. We employ a family of 81 nucleonic equations of state (EoSs) based on covariant density functional with variable skewness and slope of symmetry energy at saturation density and a constant speed-of-sound EoS for quark matter. For each nucleonic EoS, a family of hybrid star EoS is generated by varying the transition density from nucleonic to quark matter, the density jump at the transition, and the speed-of-sound. These models are tested against the data from GW170817 and J1731-347, which favor low-density soft EoS and PSR J0592-0607 and J0740+6620, which require high-density stiff EoS. We then examine the occurrence of twin configurations and quantify the ranges of masses and radii that they can possess. It is shown that including J1731-347 data favors EoS models which predict low-mass twin stars with masses $M \lesssim 1.3\,M_{\odot}$ that can be realized if the deconfinement transition density is low. If combined with a large speed-of-sound in quark matter such models allow for maximum masses of hybrid stars in the range $2.0$-$2.6\,M_{\odot}$.

 Aims. The initial stages of planet formation may start concurrently with the formation of a gas-dust protoplanetary disk. This makes the study of the earliest stages of protoplanetary disk formation crucially important. Here we focus on dust growth and pebble formation in a protoplanetary disk that is still accreting from a parental cloud core. Methods. We have developed an original three-dimensional numerical hydrodynamics code, which computes the collapse of rotating clouds and disk formation on nested meshes using a novel hybrid Coarray Fortran-OpenMP approach for distributed and shared memory parallelization. Dust dynamics and growth are also included in the simulations. Results. We found that the dust growth from $\sim 1~\mu$m to 1-10~mm already occurs in the initial few thousand years of disk evolution but the Stokes number hardly exceeds 0.1 because of higher disk densities and temperatures compared to the minimum mass Solar nebular. The ratio of the dust-to-gas vertical scale heights remains rather modest, 0.2--0.5, which may be explained by the perturbing action of spiral arms that develop in the disk soon after its formation. The dust-to-gas mass ratio in the disk midplane is highly nonhomogeneous throughout the disk extent and is in general enhanced by a factor of several compared to the fiducial 1:100 value. Low St hinders strong dust accumulation in the spiral arms compared to the rest of the disk and the nonsteady nature of the spirals is also an obstacle. The spatial distribution of pebbles in the disk midplane exhibits a highly nonhomogeneous and patchy character. The total mass of pebbles in the disk increases with time and reaches a few tens of Earth masses after a few tens of thousand years of disk evolution. Abridged.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the deepest 850 $\mu$m map of the SSA22 field to date, utilizing a combination of new and archival observations taken with SCUBA-2, mounted at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). The mapped area covers an effective region of approximately 0.34 deg$^2$, achieving a boundary sensitivity of 2 mJy beam$^{-1}$, with the deepest central coverage reaching a depth of $\sigma_\text{rms}$ $\sim$ 0.79 mJy beam$^{-1}$, the confusion noise is estimated to be $\sim$ 0.43 mJy beam$^{-1}$. A catalogue of 850 $\mu$m sources in the SSA22 field is generated, identifying 390 sources with single-to-noise ratios above 3.5, out of which 92 sources exceed 5$\sigma$. The derived intrinsic number counts at 850 $\mu$m are found to be in excellent agreement with published surveys. Interestingly, the SSA22 number counts also exhibit an upturn in the brighter flux region, likely attributed to local emitters or lensing objects within the field. On the scale of $\sim$ 0.3 deg$^2$, the 850 $\mu$m number counts are unaffected by cosmic variance and align with the blank field. In the deep region ($\sigma_\text{rms}$ $\leqslant$ 1 mJy), the counts for fluxes below 8 mJy are consistent with the blank field, and the excess in the brighter regime is not significant. Due to the limited number of very bright sources and the insubstantial cosmic variance in our field, we attribute the fluctuations in the number counts primarily to Poisson noise. The SCUBA-2 850 $\mu$m detection in the SSA22 field does not exhibit indications of overdensity.

 - **Abstract**
 During solar flares, spectral lines formed in the photosphere have been shown to exhibit changes to their profiles despite the challenges of energy transfer to these depths. Recent work has shown that deep-forming spectral lines are subject to significant contributions from regions above the photosphere throughout the flaring period, resulting in a composite emergent intensity profile from multiple layers of the atmosphere. We employ radiative-hydrodynamic and radiative transfer calculations to simulate the response of the solar/stellar atmosphere to electron beam heating and synthesize spectral lines of Fe I to investigate the line-of-sight velocity fields information available from Doppler shifts of the emergent intensity profile. By utilizing the contribution function to deconstruct the line profile shape into its constituent sources, we show that variations in the line profiles are primarily caused by changes in the chromosphere. Up-flows in this region were found to create blueshifts or "false" redshifts in the line core dependent on the relative contribution of the chromosphere compared to the photosphere. In extreme solar and stellar flare scenarios featuring explosive chromospheric condensations, red-shifted transient components can dominate the temporal evolution of the profile shape, requiring a tertiary component consideration to fully characterize. We conclude that deep-forming lines require a multi-component understanding and treatment, with different regions of the spectral line being useful for probing individual regions of the atmosphere's velocity flows.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on studies of Classical Nova (CN) explosions where we follow the evolution of thermonuclear runaways (TNRs) on oxygen-neon (ONe) white dwarfs (WDs). Using NOVA, a one-dimensional hydrodynamic computer code, we accrete Solar matter until the TNR is ongoing and then switch to a mixed composition. This approach is guided by the results of multi-dimensional studies of TNRs in WDs which find that sufficient mixing with WD core material occurs after the TNR is well underway, and levels of enrichment of the CNONeMg elements are reached that agree with observations of CN ejecta abundances. Because the amount of accreted material is inversely proportional to the oxygen abundance, by first accreting Solar matter, the amount of accreted material is larger than in those simulations with an initially enriched composition. We vary the mass of the WD (from 0.6 Msun to 1.35 Msun) and the composition of the mixed materials. Our results show large enrichments of 7Be in the ejected gases implying that ONe CNe and CO CNe (Starrfield et al. 2020) may be responsible for a significant fraction (about 100 Msun) of the galactic 7Li ( about 1000 Msun). The production of 22Na and 26Al in CN explosions and the gamma-ray emission predicted by our simulations is discussed. The WDs in all our simulations eject less material than they accrete and we predict that the WD is growing in mass as a consequence of the CN outburst. ONe CNe, therefore, may be an important channel for accretion induced collapse (AIC) events.

 - **Abstract**
 We successfully measured the trigonometric parallax of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) to be $117\pm17$ micro-arcseconds ($\mu$as) using the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA) with the newly developed broad-band signal-processing system named OCTAVE-DAS. The measured parallax corresponds to a Galactocentric distance at the Sun of $R_0 = 8.5^{+1.5}_{-1.1}$ kpc. By combining the astrometric results with VERA and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) over a monitoring period of 25 years, the proper motion of Sgr A* is obtained to be $(\mu_\alpha, \mu_\delta) = (-3.133\pm0.003, -5.575\pm0.005)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ in equatorial coordinates, corresponding to $(\mu_l, \mu_b) = (-6.391\pm0.005, -0.230\pm0.004)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ in Galactic coordinates. This gives an angular orbital velocity of the Sun of $\Omega_\odot = 30.30 \pm 0.02$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. We find upper limits to the core wander, $\Delta \theta < 0.20$ mas (1.6 AU), peculiar motion, $\Delta \mu < 0.10$ mas yr$^{-1}$ (3.7 km s$^{-1}$), and acceleration, $a < 2.6$ $\mu$as yr$^{-2}$ (0.10 km s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$) for Sgr A*. Thus, we obtained upper mass limits of $\approx$ 3 $\times$ 10$^{4}$$M_{\odot}$ and $\approx$ 3 $\times$ 10$^{3}$$M_{\odot}$ for the supposed intermediate-mass black holes at 0.1 and 0.01 pc from the Galactic center, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray-emitting symbiotic stars exhibit a variety of spectral shapes classified as $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$ and $\beta$/$\delta$ types, which have been attributed to different phenomena such as thermonuclear burning on the surface of the white dwarf (WD) component, shocks between winds and jets with the red giant companion's extended atmosphere, the presence of heavily extinguished hot plasma from the inner region from an accretion disk and/or a combination of these. However, there is observational evidence that this classification scheme is not definite and, for example, some sources change from one type to another within months or years. In this work, it is proposed that a simple disk-like model can be used to explain the X-ray properties observed from reflection dominated symbiotic stars. For this purpose we use the Stellar Kinematics Including Radiative Transfer (SKIRT) code, which has been recently upgraded to include radiative transfer from X-ray photons. It is found that thee properties of the accretion disk (geometry and density) in combination with the viewing angle can be invoke to explain the spectral properties of $\beta$, $\delta$ and $\beta/\delta$ X-ray-emitting symbiotic stars. Spectral variations and type swaps observed for some X-ray-emitting sources can also be explained by variations in the disk properties.
#### Exploring the dependence of chemical traits on metallicity: chemical  trends for red giant stars with asteroseismic ages

 - **Abstract**
 Given the massive spectroscopic surveys and the Gaia mission, the Milky Way has turned into a unique laboratory to be explored using abundance ratios that show a strong dependency with time. Within this framework, the data provided through asteroseismology serve as a valuable complement. Yet, it has been demonstrated that chemical traits can not be used as universal relations across the Galaxy. To complete this picture, it is important to investigate the dependence on metallicity of the chemical ratios employed for inferring stellar ages. We aim to explore different combinations of neutron-capture, odd-Z and $\alpha$ elements as a function of age, particularly focusing on their metallicity dependence for a sample of 74 giant field stars. Using UVES observations, we derive atmospheric parameters and high-precision line by line chemical abundances (<0.04 dex) for the entire set of spectra. Stellar ages are inferred from astereoseismic information. By fitting chemical-age trends for three different metallicity groups, we estimated their dependence on metallicity. We found that the stronger chemical-age relations ([Zr/$\alpha$]) are not necessarily the ratios with the smaller dependence on metallicity ([Ce/$\alpha$] and [Ce/Eu]). We confirm the [n-capture/$\alpha$]-age trends for evolved stars, wherein the most significant correlation is evident in stars with solar-metallicity, gradually diminishing in stars with lower iron content. The lack of homogeneity within the metallicity range highlights the intricate nature of our Galaxy's star formation history and yield production. Metallicity dependence in s-process element yields and the impact of radial stellar migration challenge the reliability of using chemical abundances alone to date stars. These discoveries raise doubts about universally valid chemical clocks applicable across the entire Galaxy and its diverse metallicity ranges.
#### Structural stability of China's asteroid mission target 2016 HO3 and its  possible structure

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroid 2016 HO3, a small asteroid (<60 m) in super fast rotation state (~28 min), and is the target of China's Tianwen-2 asteroid sample-return mission. In this work, we investigate its structural stability using an advanced soft-sphere-discrete-element-model code, DEMBody, which is integrated with bonded-aggregate models to simulate highly irregular boulders. The asteroid body is numerically constructed by tens of thousands particles, and then is slowly spin up until structural failure. Rubble piles with different morphologies, grain size distributions and structures are investigated. We find a 2016 HO3 shaped granular asteroid would undergo tensile failure at higher cohesive strengths as opposed to shear failure in lower strengths, regardless of its shape and constituent grain size ratio. Such a failure mode transition is consistent with the priority between the Maximum Tensile Stress criterion criterion and the Drucker-Prager criterion. Therefore, previous works that solely considered the Drucker-Prager failure criterion have underestimated the minimal cohesion strength required for fast-rotating asteroids. We predict that the high spin rate of asteroid 2016 HO3 requires a surface cohesion over ~1 Pa and a bulk cohesion over ~10-20 Pa. Through comparing these strength conditions with the latest data from asteroid missions, we suggest a higher likelihood of a monolithic structure over a typical rubble pile structure. However, the possibility of the latter cannot be completely ruled out. In addition, the asteroid's surface could retain a loose regolith layer globally or only near its poles, which could be the target for sampling of Tianwen-2 mission.

 - **Abstract**
 A fraction of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) with signs of interaction with a dense circumstellar matter are preceded by bright precursor emission. While the precursors are likely caused by a mass ejection before core-collapse, their mechanism to power energetic bursts, sometimes reaching $10^{48}$--$10^{49}\ {\rm erg}$ that are larger than the binding energies of red supergiant envelopes, is still under debate. Remarkably, such a huge energy-deposition should result in an almost complete envelope ejection and hence a strong sign of interaction, but the observed SNe with precursors show in fact typical properties among the interacting SNe. More generally, the observed luminosity of $10^{40-42}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ is shown to be challenging for a single SN progenitor. To resolve these tensions, we propose a scenario where the progenitor is in a binary system with a compact object (CO), and an outburst from the star leads to a super-Eddington accretion onto the CO. We show that for sufficiently short separations, outbursts with moderate initial kinetic energies of $10^{46}$--$10^{47}$ erg can be energized by the accreting CO so that their radiative output can be consistent with the observed precursors. We discuss the implications of our model in relation to CO binaries detectable with Gaia and gravitational wave detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 Panspermia is the hypothesis that life originated on Earth from the bombardment of foreign interstellar ejecta harboring polyextremophile microorganisms. Since the 2017 discovery of the comet-like body 'Oumuamua (1I/2017 U1) by the Pans-STARRS telescope, various studies have re-examined panspermia based on updated number density models that accommodate for 'Oumuamua's properties. By utilizing 'Oumuamua's properties as an anchor, we estimate the mass and number density of ejecta in the ISM (rho_m [kg au^-3] and rho_n [au^-3]). We build upon prior work by first accounting for the minimum ejecta size to shield microbes from supernova radiation. Second, we estimate the total number of impact events C_n on Earth after its formation and prior to the emergence of life (~0.8Gyr). We derive a conditional probability relation for the likelihood of panspermia for Earth specifically of <10^-5, given a number of factors including f_B, the fraction of ejecta harboring extremophiles and other factors that are poorly constrained. However, we find that panspermia is a plausible potential life-seeding mechanism for (optimistically) up to ~10^5 of the ~10^9 Earth-sized habitable zone worlds in our Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 For most of cosmic history, the evolution of our Universe has been governed by the physics of a 'dark sector', consisting of dark matter and dark energy, whose properties are only understood in a schematic way. The influence of these constituents is mediated exclusively by the force of gravity, meaning that insight into their nature must be gleaned from gravitational phenomena. The advent of gravitational-wave astronomy has revolutionised the field of black hole astrophysics, and opens a new window of discovery for cosmological sources. Relevant examples include topological defects, such as domain walls or cosmic strings, which are remnants of a phase transition. Here we present the first simulations of cosmic structure formation in which the dynamics of the dark sector introduces domain walls as a source of stochastic gravitational waves in the late Universe. We study in detail how the spectrum of gravitational waves is affected by the properties of the model, and extrapolate the results to scales relevant to the recent evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background. Our relativistic implementation of the field dynamics paves the way for optimal use of the next generation of gravitational experiments to unravel the dark sector.

 - **Abstract**
 The symmetron is a dark energy and dark matter candidate that forms topological defects in the late-time universe and holds promise to resolve some of the cosmological tensions. We perform high resolution simulations of the dynamical and non-linear (a)symmetron using the recently developed relativistic N-body code asevolution. By extensively testing the temporal and spatial convergence of domain decompositioning and domain wall stability, we find criteria and physical intuition for the convergence. We apply the resolution criteria to run five high resolution, $1280^3$ grids and 500 Mpc/h boxsize, simulations of the (a)symmetron and consider the behaviour of the scalar field and the domain walls in each scenario. We find the effect on the matter power spectra, the halo mass function and observables computed over the past lightcone of an observer such as the integrated Sachs-Wolfe and non-linear Rees-Sciama effect (ISW-RS) and the lensing, compared to LCDM. We show local oscillations of the fifth force strength and the formation of planar structures in the density field. The dynamics of the field is visualised in animations with high resolution in time. The simulation code is made publicly available.
