          The Detection of a Possible Exoplanet Orbiting KIC 1718360 Using Machine Learning

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents the detection of a periodic dimming event in the lightcurve of the G1.5IV-V type star KIC 1718360. This is based on visible-light observations conducted by both the TESS and Kepler space telescopes. Analysis of the data points toward a possible orbiting body with a radius of approximately 1.048 Earth Radii with a period of 2.938 days, as well as a semi-major axis of 0.04 AU. The initial observation was made in Kepler Quarter 16 data using the One-Class SVM machine learning method. Subsequent observations by the TESS space telescope corroborate these findings. While still requiring further data to validate, these results may contribute to a growing body of data of Earthlike planets with short-period orbits.

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disks are prone to several hydrodynamic instabilities. One candidate, Convective Overstability (COS), can drive radial semi-convection that may influence dust dynamics and planetesimal formation. However, the COS has primarily been studied in local models. This paper investigates the COS near the mid-plane of radially global disk models. We first conduct a global linear stability analysis, which shows that linear COS modes exist only radially inward of their Lindblad resonance (LR). The fastest-growing modes have LRs near the inner radial domain boundary with effective radial wavelengths that can be a substantial fraction of the disk radius. We then perform axisymmetric global simulations and find that the COS's nonlinear saturation is similar to previous incompressible shearing box simulations. In particular, we observe the onset of persistent zonal and elevator flows for sufficiently steep radial entropy gradients. In full 3D, non-axisymmetric global simulations, we find the COS produces large-scale, long-lived vortices, which induce outward radial transport of angular momentum via the excitation of spiral density waves. The corresponding $\alpha$-viscosity values of order $10^{-3}$ agree well with those found in previous 3D compressible shearing box simulations. However, in global disks, significant modifications to their radial structure are found, including the formation of pressure bumps. Interestingly, the COS typically generates an outward radial mass transport, i.e. decretion. We briefly discuss the possible implications of our results for planetesimal formation and for interpreting dust rings and asymmetries observed in protoplanetary disks.

 - **Abstract**
 The spatial-kinematic structure of 48 young star clusters and associations is investigated. Moran's $I$ statistic is used to quantify the degree of kinematic substructure in each region, and the results are compared to those expected assuming the hierarchical or monolithic models of star cluster formation. Of the observed regions, 39 are found to have significant kinematic substructure, such that they are compatible with the hierarchical model and incompatible with the monolithic model. This includes multiple regions whose $Q$ parameter shows the region to be centrally concentrated and clustered. The remaining nine are compatible with both models. From this it is concluded that the kinematic substructure of the observed star clusters represents strong evidence in favour the hierarchical model of star cluster formation over the monolithic model.

 - **Abstract**
 The relationship between stars and planets provides important information for understanding the interior composition, mineralogy, and overall classification of small planets (R $\lesssim$ 3.5R$_{\oplus}$). Since stars and planets are formed at the same time and from the same material, their compositions are inextricably linked to one another, especially with respect refractory elements like Mg, Si, and Fe. As a result, stellar elemental abundances can help break the degeneracy inherent to planetary mass-radius models and determine whether planets may be similar to the Earth in composition or if additional factors, such as formation near the host star or a giant impact, may have influenced the planet's make-up. To this end, we now have observations of the abundances of extrasolar rocks that were pulled onto the surfaces of a white dwarfs, whose compositions act as a direct insight into the interiors of small exoplanets. From measurements of $\sim$30 of these "polluted" white dwarfs, we have found that composition of the extrasolar rocks are similar to Solar System chondritic meteorites.

          Chemo-dynamical Evolution of Simulated Satellites for a Milky Way-like Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical abundances of Milky Way's satellites reflect their star formation histories (SFHs), yet, due to the difficulty of determining the ages of old stars, the SFHs of most satellites are poorly measured. Ongoing and upcoming surveys will obtain around ten times more medium-resolution spectra for stars in satellites than are currently available. To correctly extract SFHs from large samples of chemical abundances, the relationship between chemical abundances and SFHs needs to be clarified. Here, we perform a high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy with detailed models of star formation, supernova feedback, and metal diffusion. We quantify SFHs, metallicity distribution functions, and the $\alpha$-element (Mg, Ca, and Si) abundances in satellites of the host galaxy. We find that star formation in most simulated satellites is quenched before infalling to their host. Star formation episodes in simulated satellites are separated by a few hundred Myr owing to supernova feedback; each star formation event produces groups of stars with similar [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Fe/H]. We then perform a mock observation of the upcoming Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) observations. We find that Subaru PFS will be able to detect distinct groups of stars in [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] space, produced by episodic star formation. This result means that episodic SFHs can be estimated from the chemical abundances of $\gtrsim$ 1,000 stars determined with medium-resolution spectroscopy.

          Self-Similar Mass Accretion History in Scale-Free Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Using a scale-free $N$-body simulation generated with the ABACUS $N$-body code, we test the robustness of halo mass accretion histories via their convergence to self-similarity. We compare two halo finders, ROCKSTAR and COMPASO. We find superior self-similarity in halo mass accretion histories determined using ROCKSTAR, with convergence to 5% or better between $\sim10^2$ to $10^5$ particles. For COMPASO we find weaker convergence over a similar region, with at least 10% between $\sim10^2$ to $10^4$ particles. Furthermore, we find the convergence to self-similarity improves as the simulation evolves, with the largest and deepest regions of convergence appearing after the scale factor quadrupled from the time at which non-linear structures begin to form. With sufficient time evolution, halo mass accretion histories are converged to self-similarity within 5% with as few as $\sim70$ particles for COMPASO and within 2% for as few as $\sim30$ particles for ROCKSTAR.

          Resonant chains in triple-planetary systems

 - **Abstract**
 A resonant chain may be formed in a multi-planetary system when ratios of the orbital periods can be expressed as ratios of small integers $T_1:T_2: \cdots :T_N=k_1: k_2: \cdots: k_N$. We investigate the dynamics and possible formation of resonant chain. The appropriate Hamiltonian for a three-planet resonant chain is defined and numerically averaged over the synodic period. The stable stationary solutions (apsidal corotational resonance, ACR) of this system, corresponding to the local extrema of Hamiltonian function, can be searched out numerically. The topology of the Hamiltonian around these ACRs reveals their stabilities. We further construct dynamical maps on representative planes to study the dynamics, and we calculate the deviation ($\chi^2$) of the resonant angle from the uniformly distributed values. Finally, the formation of resonant chain via convergent migration is simulated and stable configurations associated with ACRs are verified. We find that stable ACR families arising from circular orbits always exist for any resonant chain, and they may extend to high eccentricity. Around ACR solutions, regular motion are found in two types of resonant configurations. One is characterised by libration of both the two-body resonant angles and the three-body Laplace resonant angle, and the other by libration of only two-body resonant angles. The Laplace resonance seems not to contribute much to the stability. The resonant chain can be formed via convergent migration, and subsequently the resonant configuration evolves along the ACR families to eccentric orbits. Ideally, our methods introduced here can be applied to any resonant chain of any number of planets at any eccentricity.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern inference schemes for the neutron star equation of state (EoS) require large numbers of stellar models constructed with different EoS, and these stellar models must capture all the behavior of stable stars. I introduce termination conditions for sequences of stellar models for cold, non-rotating neutron stars that are guaranteed to identify all stable stellar configurations up to arbitrarily large central pressures along with an efficient algorithm to build accurate interpolators for macroscopic properties. I explore the behavior of stars with both high- and low-central pressures. Interestingly, I find that EoS with monotonically increasing sound-speed can produce multiple stable branches (twin stars) and that large phase transitions at high densities can produce stable branches at nearly any mass scale, including sub-solar masses, while still supporting stars with $M > 2\,M_\odot$. I conclude with some speculation about the astrophysical implications of this behavior.

          Carbon cycle instability for high-$\mathrm{CO_2}$ exoplanets: Implications for habitability

 - **Abstract**
 Implicit in the definition of the classical circumstellar habitable zone (HZ) is the hypothesis that the carbonate-silicate cycle can maintain clement climates on exoplanets with land and surface water across a range of instellations by adjusting atmospheric $\mathrm{CO_2}$ partial pressure ($p\mathrm{CO_2}$). This hypothesis is made by analogy to the Earth system, but it is an open question whether silicate weathering can stabilize climate on planets in the outer reaches of the HZ, where instellations are lower than those received by even the Archean Earth and $\mathrm{CO_2}$ is thought likely to dominate atmospheres. Since weathering products are carried from land to ocean by the action of water, silicate weathering is intimately coupled to the hydrologic cycle, which intensifies with hotter temperatures under Earth-like conditions. Here, we use global climate model (GCM) simulations to demonstrate that the hydrologic cycle responds counterintuitively to changes in climate on planets with $\mathrm{CO_2}$-$\mathrm{H_2O}$ atmospheres at low instellations and high $p\mathrm{CO_2}$, with global evaporation and precipitation decreasing as $p\mathrm{CO_2}$ and temperatures increase at a given instellation. Within the MAC weathering formulation, weathering then decreases with increasing $p\mathrm{CO_2}$ for a range of instellations and $p\mathrm{CO_2}$ typical of the outer reaches of the HZ, resulting in an unstable carbon cycle that may lead to either runaway $\mathrm{CO_2}$ accumulation or depletion of $\mathrm{CO_2}$ to colder (possibly Snowball) conditions. While the behavior of the system has not been completely mapped out, the results suggest that silicate weathering could fail to maintain habitable conditions in the outer reaches of the nominal HZ.

          From Young Massive Clusters to Old Globular Clusters: Density Profile Evolution and IMBH Formation

 - **Abstract**
 The surface brightness profiles of globular clusters are conventionally described with the well-known King profile. However, observations of young massive clusters (YMCs) in the local Universe suggest that they are better fit by simple models with flat central cores and simple power-law densities in their outer regions (such as the Elson-Fall-Freeman, or EFF, profile). Depending on their initial central density, these YMCs may also facilitate large numbers of stellar collisions, potentially creating very massive stars that will directly collapse to intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). Using Monte Carlo $N$-body models of YMCs, we show that EFF-profile clusters transform to Wilson or King profiles through natural dynamical evolution, but that their final $W_0$ parameters do not strongly correlate to their initial concentrations. The most centrally-dense YMCs can produce runaway stellar mergers as massive as $4000\,M_{\odot}$ (the largest resolved mass in our simulations) which can collapse to produce IMBHs of similar masses. In doing so, these runaway collisions also deplete the clusters of their primordial massive stars, reducing the number of stellar-mass BHs by as much as $\sim$ 40\%. This depletion will accelerate the core collapse of clusters, suggesting that the process of IMBH formation itself may produce the high densities observed in some core-collapsed clusters.

          Power spectrum multipoles and clustering wedges during the Epoch of Reionization

 - **Abstract**
 We study the viability of using power spectrum clustering wedges as summary statistics of 21cm surveys during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). For observations along a large lightcone $z\sim 7-9$, the power spectrum is subject to large anisotropic effects due to the evolution along the light-of-sight. Information on the physics of reionization can be extracted from the anisotropy using the power spectrum multipoles. Signals of the power spectrum monopole are highly correlated at scales smaller than the typical ionization bubble, which can be disentangled by including higher-order multipoles. By simulating observations of the low frequency part of the SKA Observatory, we find that the sampling of the cylindrical wavenumber $k$-space is highly non-uniform due to the baseline distribution. Measurements in clustering wedges can be used for isolating parts of $k$-space with relatively uniform sampling, allowing for more precise parameter inference. Using Fisher Matrix forecasts, we find that the reionization model can be inferred with per-cent level precision with $\sim 120$hrs of integration time using SKA-Low. Comparing to using only the power spectrum monopole above the foreground wedge, model inference using multipole power spectra in clustering wedges yields a factor of $\sim 3$ improvement on parameter constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope produces some of the highest sensitivity imaging of the cosmos across all instruments. One of them, the NIRISS Fine Guidance Sensor, provides guide star imaging with a passband of 0.6 to 5 microns through two separate channels, each with a 2.3' x 2.3' field of view (FOV) and a sampling rate of 64 ms$-$data that is taken in parallel and is thus available for every JWST observing program. While the onboard system uses guide stars to provide information to the attitude control system (ACS), which stabilizes the observatory, the astronomical community can also use the data products associated with these 64 ms cadence images as science products. Usages range from studying guide star photometry in search of transient phenomena to using these data to identify and investigate technical anomalies that might occur during scientific observations with the rest of the JWST instruments. Despite this wide range of possible usages, these data products are not straightforward to manipulate and analyze, and there is no publicly available package to download, investigate, and research guide star data. Spelunker is a Python library that was developed to enable access to these guide star data products and their analysis.

          Theoretical investigation of energy levels and transitions for Ce III with applications to kilonova spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Doubly ionized cerium (Ce$^{2+}$) is one of the most important ions to understand the kilonova spectra. In particular, near-infrared (NIR) transitions of Ce III between the ground (5p$^6$ 4f$^2$) and first excited (5p$^6$ 4f 5d) configurations are responsible for the absorption features around 14,500 A. However, there is no dedicated theoretical studies to provide accurate transition probabilities for these transitions. We present energy levels of the ground and first excited configurations and transition data between them for Ce III. Calculations are performed using the GRASP2018 package, which is based on the multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock and relativistic configuration interaction methods. Compared with the energy levels in the NIST database, our calculations reach the accuracy with the root-mean-square (rms) of 2732 cm$^{-1}$ or 1404 cm$^{-1}$ (excluding one highest level) for ground configuration, and rms of 618 cm$^{-1}$ for the first excited configuration. We extensively study the line strengths and find that the Babushkin gauge provide the more accurate values. By using the calculated gf values, we show that the NIR spectral features of kilonova can be explained by the Ce III lines.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pyramid Wavefront Sensor (PyWFS) is highly nonlinear and requires the use of beam modulation to successfully close an AO loop under varying atmospheric turbulence conditions, at the expense of a loss in sensitivity. In this work we train, analyse, and compare the use of deep neural networks (NNs) as non-linear estimators for the non-modulated PyWFS, identifying the most suitable NN architecture for reliable closed-loop AO. We develop a novel training strategy for NNs that seeks to accommodate for changes in residual statistics between open and closed-loop, plus the addition of noise for robustness purposes. Through simulations, we test and compare several deep NNs, from classical to new convolutional neural networks (CNNs), plus a state-of-the-art transformer neural network (TNN, Global Context Visual Transformer, GCViT), first in open-loop and then in closed-loop. Using open-loop simulated data, we observe that a TNN (GCViT) largely surpasses any CNN in estimation accuracy in a wide range of turbulence conditions. Also, the TNN performs better in simulated closed-loop than CNNs, avoiding estimation issues at the pupil borders. When closing the loop at strong turbulence and low noise, the TNN using non-modulated PyWFS data is able to close the loop similar to a PyWFS with $12\lambda/D$ of modulation. When raising the noise only the TNN is able to close the loop, while the standard linear reconstructor fails, even with modulation. Using the GCViT, we close a real AO loop in the optical bench achieving a Strehl ratio between 0.28 and 0.77 for turbulence conditions ranging from 6cm to 20cm, respectively. In conclusion, we demonstrate that a TNN is the most suitable architecture to extend the dynamic range without sacrificing sensitivity for a non-modulated PyWFS. It opens the path for using non-modulated Pyramid WFSs under an unprecedented range of atmospheric and noise conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Connecting a coronagraph instrument to a spectrograph via a single-mode optical fiber is a promising technique for characterizing the atmospheres of exoplanets with ground and space-based telescopes. However, due to the small separation and extreme flux ratio between planets and their host stars, instrument sensitivity will be limited by residual starlight leaking into the fiber. To minimize stellar leakage, we must control the electric field at the fiber input. Implicit electric field conjugation (iEFC) is a model-independent wavefront control technique in contrast with classical electric field conjugation (EFC) which requires a detailed optical model of the system. We present here the concept of an iEFC-based wavefront control algorithm to improve stellar rejection through a single-mode fiber. As opposed to image-based iEFC which relies on minimizing intensity in a dark hole region, our approach aims to minimize the amount of residual starlight coupling into a single-mode fiber. We present broadband simulation results demonstrating a normalized intensity greater than 10^{-10} for both fiber-based EFC and iEFC. We find that both control algorithms exhibit similar performance for the low wavefront error (WFE) case, however, iEFC outperforms EFC by approximately 100x in the high WFE regime. Having no need for an optical model, this fiber-based approach offers a promising alternative to EFC for ground and space-based telescope missions, particularly in the presence of residual WFE.

 - **Abstract**
 High-precision ephemerides are not only useful in supporting space missions, but also in investigating the physical nature of celestial bodies. This paper reports an update to the orbit and rotation model of the Martian moon Phobos. In contrast to earlier numerical models, this paper details a dynamical model that fully considers the rotation of Phobos. Here, Phobos' rotation is first described by Euler's rotational equations and integrated simultaneously with the orbital motion equations. We discuss this dynamical model, along with the differences with respect to the model now in use. We present the variational equation for Phobos' rotation employing the symbolic \emph{Maple} computation software. The adjustment test simulations confirm the latitude libration of Phobos, suggesting gravity field coefficients obtained using a shape model and homogeneous density hypothesis should be re-examined in the future in the context of dynamics. Furthermore, the simulations with different $k_2$ values indicate that it is difficult to determine k_2 efficiently using the current data.

 - **Abstract**
 The Simons Observatory (SO) is a cosmic microwave background (CMB) survey experiment that includes small-aperture telescopes (SATs) observing from an altitude of 5,200 m in the Atacama Desert in Chile. The SO SATs will cover six spectral bands between 27 and 280 GHz to search for primordial B-modes to a sensitivity of $\sigma(r)=0.002$, with quantified systematic errors well below this value. Each SAT is a self-contained cryogenic telescope with a 35$^\circ$ field of view, 42 cm diameter optical aperture, 40 K half-wave plate, 1 K refractive optics, and $<0.1$ K focal plane that holds $>12,000$ TES detectors. We describe the nominal design of the SATs and present details about the integration and testing for one operating at 93 and 145 GHz.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the variability of the accretion disks of black holes and jets is important to identify their internal physical processes. In this letter, we obtain the characteristic damping timescale of 34 blazars and seven microquasars from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope and the XMM-Newton X-ray telescope, respectively. We found that the mass-scaled characteristic timescales, ranging from the microquasars of stellar-mass black holes to the blazars of supermassive black holes, exhibited a linear relationship with a slope of $\sim$0.57. Given the fact the damping timescales of the $\gamma$-ray in the blazars are associated with the jet, we propose that the timescales of the X-ray in these microquasars are also related with the jet. The mass-scaled damping timescale that we found was consistent with the radiation of the optical accretion disk. This can be attributed to the viscous timescale at the ultraviolet-emitting radii of the disk, which can affect the jet. Our study provides a new perspective on the origin of the region of radiation and the possible disk--jet connection based on time-domain analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel method for detecting outliers in astronomical time series based on the combination of a deep neural network and a k-nearest neighbor algorithm with the aim of identifying and removing problematic epochs in the light curves of astronomical objects. We use an EfficientNet network pre-trained on ImageNet as a feature extractor and perform a k-nearest neighbor search in the resulting feature space to measure the distance from the first neighbor for each image. If the distance is above the one obtained for a stacked image, we flag the image as a potential outlier. We apply our method to time series obtained from the VLT Survey Telescope (VST) monitoring campaign of the Deep Drilling Fields of the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)\thanksObservations were provided by the ESO programs 088.D-4013, 092.D-0370, and 094.D-0417 (PI G. Pignata).. We show that our method can effectively identify and remove artifacts from the VST time series and improve the quality and reliability of the data. This approach may prove very useful in sight of the amount of data that will be provided by the LSST, which will prevent the inspection of individual light curves. We also discuss the advantages and limitations of our method and suggest possible directions for future work.

 - **Abstract**
 Optimal extraction of cosmological information from observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background critically relies on our ability to accurately undo the distortions caused by weak gravitational lensing. In this work, we demonstrate the use of denoising diffusion models in performing Bayesian lensing reconstruction. We show that score-based generative models can produce accurate, uncorrelated samples from the CMB lensing convergence map posterior, given noisy CMB observations. To validate our approach, we compare the samples of our model to those obtained using established Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods, which assume a Gaussian lensing potential. We then go beyond this assumption of Gaussianity, and train and validate our model on non-Gaussian lensing data, obtained by ray-tracing N-body simulations. We demonstrate that in this case, samples from our model have accurate non-Gaussian statistics beyond the power spectrum. The method provides an avenue towards more efficient and accurate lensing reconstruction, that does not rely on an approximate analytic description of the posterior probability. The reconstructed lensing maps can be used as an unbiased tracer of the matter distribution, and to improve delensing of the CMB, resulting in more precise cosmological parameter inference.

 - **Abstract**
 XRPIX is the monolithic X-ray SOI (silicon-on-insulator) pixel detector, which has a time resolution better than 10 $\rm{\mu}$s as well as a high detection efficiency for X-rays above 10 keV. XRPIX is planned to be installed on future X-ray satellites. To mount on satellites, it is essential that the ADC (analog-to-digital converter) be implemented on the detector because such peripheral circuits must be as compact as possible to achieve a large imaging area in the limited space in satellites. Thus, we developed a new XRPIX device with the on-chip ADC, and evaluated its performances. As the results, the integral non-linearity was evaluated to be 6 LSB (least significant bit), equivalent to 36~eV. The differential non-linearity was less than 0.7 LSB, and input noise from the on-chip ADC was 5~$\rm{e^{-}}$. Also, we evaluated end-to-end performance including the sensor part as well as the on-chip ADC. As the results, energy resolution at 5.9~keV was 294 $\rm{\pm}$ 4~eV in full-width at half maximum for the best pixel.

          Development of realistic simulations for the polarization of the cosmic microwave background

 - **Abstract**
 Polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can help probe cosmic inflation (via primordial $B$ modes) and test parity-violating physics (via cosmic birefringence), but realizing the potential of these opportunities requires precise control and mitigation of systematic effects. To this end, some experiments (including LiteBIRD) will use rotating half-wave plates (HWPs) as polarization modulators. Ideally, this choice should remove the $1/f$ noise component in the observed polarization and reduce intensity-to-polarization leakage, but any real HWP is characterized by non-idealities that, if not properly treated in the analysis, can lead to new systematics. In this thesis, after briefly introducing the science case, we discuss the macro steps that make up any CMB experiment, introduce the HWP, and present a new time-ordered data (TOD) simulation pipeline tailored to a LiteBIRD-like experiment that returns TOD and binned maps for realistic beams and HWPs. We show that the simulation framework can be used to study how the HWP non-idealities affect the measured cosmic birefringence angle, resulting in a few degrees bias for a realistic choice of HWP. We also derive analytical formulae to model the observed temperature and polarization maps and test them against the simulations. Finally, we present a simple, semi-analytical end-to-end model to propagate the non-idealities through the macro-steps that make up any CMB experiment (observation of multi-frequency maps, foreground cleaning, and power spectra estimation) and compute the HWP-induced bias on the estimated tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, finding that the HWP leads to underestimating $r$. We also show how gain calibration of the CMB temperature can be used to partially mitigate the non-idealities' effect and present a set of recommendations for the HWP design that can help maximize the benefits of gain calibration.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic kilometer neutrino telescope located at the Geographic South Pole. For every observed neutrino event, there are over $10^6$ background events caused by cosmic ray air shower muons. In order to properly separate signal from background, it is necessary to produce Monte Carlo simulations of these air showers. Although to-date, IceCube has produced large quantities of background simulation, these studies still remain statistics limited. The first stage of simulation requires heavy CPU usage while the second stage requires heavy GPU usage. Processing both of these stages on the same node will result in an underutilized GPU but using different nodes will encounter bandwidth bottlenecks. Furthermore, due to the power-law energy spectrum of cosmic rays, the memory footprint of the detector response often exceeded the limit in unpredictable ways. This proceeding presents new client-server code which parallelizes the first stage onto multiple CPUs on the same node and then passes it on to the GPU for photon propagation. This results in GPU utilization of greater than 90% as well as more predictable memory usage and an overall factor of 20 improvement in speed over previous techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBH) can efficiently form black hole binaries in the early universe. We update the resulting constraints on PBH abundance using data from the third observational run (O3) of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. To capture a wide range of PBH scenarios, we consider a variety of mass functions, including critical collapse in the QCD epoch in the presence of non-Gaussianities. Applying hierarchical Bayesian analysis to a population binaries consisting of primordial and astrophysical black holes, we find that, in every scenario, the PBHs can make up at most $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-3}$ of dark matter in the mass range $1-200~M_\odot$. The shape and strength of the constraints are insensitive to the type of non-Gaussianities, the modifications to the mass function during the QCD epoch, or the modelling of the astrophysical PBH population.

          Introducing two improved methods for approximating radiative cooling in hydrodynamical simulations of accretion discs

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of many astrophysical systems depends strongly on the balance between heating and cooling, in particular star formation in giant molecular clouds and the evolution of young protostellar systems. Protostellar discs are susceptible to the gravitational instability, which can play a key role in their evolution and in planet formation. The strength of the instability depends on the rate at which the system loses thermal energy. To study the evolution of these systems, we require radiative cooling approximations because full radiative transfer is generally too expensive to be coupled to hydrodynamical models. Here we present two new approximate methods for computing radiative cooling that make use of the polytropic cooling approximation. This approach invokes the assumption that each parcel of gas is located within a spherical pseudo-cloud which can then be used to approximate the optical depth. The first method combines the methods introduced by Stamatellos et al. and Lombardi et al. to overcome the limitations of each method at low and high optical depths respectively. The second, the "Modified Lombardi" method, is specifically tailored for self-gravitating discs. This modifies the scale height estimate from the method of Lombardi et al. using the analytical scale height for a self-gravitating disc. We show that the Modified Lombardi method provides an excellent approximation for the column density in a fragmenting disc, a regime in which the existing methods fail to recover the clumps and spiral structures. We therefore recommend this improved radiative cooling method for more realistic simulations of self-gravitating discs.

          Exploration of morphological coherence in open clusters with "core-shell'' structure

 - **Abstract**
 The study of their morphological coherence allows for a better understanding of the morphological evolution of open clusters. We employ the ellipsoid fitting method to delineate the 3D spatial structure of the sample clusters while using the morphological dislocation (MD) defined in our previous work and the ellipticity ratio (ER) of the clusters' inner and outer structures to characterize the morphological coherence of the sample clusters. The results show an inverse correlation between the ER of the sample clusters and the number of their members, indicating that sample clusters with much more elliptical external morphology than internal shape have generally a large number of members. Meanwhile, a slight shrinking of the MD of the sample clusters with their members' number may shed light on the significant role of the gravitational binding of the sample clusters in maintaining their morphological stability. Moreover, there are no correlations between the MD and ER of the sample clusters and their age. They are also not significantly correlated with the X-axis, the Y-axis, their orbital eccentricities, and the radial and vertical forces on them. However, the ER of the sample clusters displays some fluctuations in the distributions between it and the above covariates, implying that the morphologies of the sample clusters are sensitive to the external environment if sample effects are not taken into account. Finally, the analysis of the 3D spatial shapes of sample clusters with a small ER or a large ER demonstrates that the number of members lays an important foundation for forming a dense internal system for sample clusters. At the same time, the MD of the sample clusters can serve well as an indicator of their morphological stability, which is built on a certain amount of member stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We have estimated the largest meteoroids present in major meteor showers from observations conducted between 2019-2022 by the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) instrument on the GOES-R satellites. Our integrated time area products for the Leonids, Perseids and eta Aquariids are of order 5 x 10^10 km2 hours. We compute photometric masses for shower fireballs using the approach of Vojacek et al. 2022 to correct from narrow-band GLM luminosity to bolometric luminosity and apply the luminous efficiency relation of Ceplecha and McCrosky 1976 at high speeds. Between 2019 and 2022, the showers definitely observed by GLM were the Leonids, Perseids, and eta Aquariids, with probable detections of the Orionids and Taurids. We find the largest meteoroids to be of order 7 kg for the Leonids, 3 kg for the Perseids, and 3 kg for the eta Aquariids, corresponding to meteoroids of ~ 0.2m diameter. The Orionids and Taurids had maximum meteoroid masses of 4 kg and 150 kg respectively. The Leonids and eta Aquariids are well fit by a single power-law with differential mass exponent, s, of 2.08 +/- 0.08 and 2.00 +/- 0.09 over the mass range 10^-7 < m < 1 kg. All showers had maximum meteoroid masses compatible with Whipple gas-drag ejection, with the exception of the Perseids which have much larger meteoroids than expected which is also consistent with observations from ground based instruments. This may reflect preferential ejection in narrow jets or possibly some form of mantle erosion/release in the past for the parent comet, 109P/Swift-Tuttle.

 - **Abstract**
 The unified dark fluid model unifies dark matter and dark energy into a single component, providing an alternative and more concise framework for interpreting cosmological observations. We introduce a PAge-like Unified Dark Fluid (PUDF) model based on the PAge approximation (Huang 2020), which is parameterized by the age of the universe and an $\eta$ parameter indicating the deviation from Einstein-De Sitter Universe. The PUDF model shares many similar features of the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model and can effectively describe the large-scale structure formation and late-time cosmic acceleration. We constrain the PUDF model with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background anisotropies, baryon acoustic oscillation measurements including those from the most recent DESI 2024, the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae, and the Cosmic Chronometers compilation. Although the PUDF performs well in fitting all the cosmological datasets, the joint analysis of the data still favors the $\Lambda$CDM model over the PUDF model, according to the Bayesian evidence of model comparison.

          Time-dependent long-term hydrodynamic simulations of the inner protoplanetary disk III: The influence of photoevaporation

 - **Abstract**
 The final stages of a protoplanetary disk are essential for our understanding of the formation and evolution of planets. Photoevaporation is an important mechanism that contributes to the dispersal of an accretion disk and has significant consequences for the disk's lifetime. However, the combined effects of photoevaporation and star-disk interaction have not been investigated in previous studies. We combined an implicit disk evolution model with a photoevaporative mass-loss profile. By including the innermost disk regions down to 0.01 AU, we could calculate the star-disk interaction, the stellar spin evolution, and the transition from an accreting disk to the propeller regime self-consistently. Starting from an early Class II star-disk system, we calculated the long-term evolution of the system until the disk becomes almost completely dissolved. Photoevaporation has a significant effect on disk structure and evolution. The radial extent of the dead zone decreases, and the number of episodic accretion events (outbursts) is reduced by high stellar X-ray luminosities. Reasonable accretion rates in combination with photoevaporative gaps are possible for a dead zone that is still massive enough to develop episodic accretion events. Furthermore, the stellar spin evolution during the Class II evolution is less affected by the star-disk interaction in the case of high X-ray luminosities. Our results suggest that the formation of planets, especially habitable planets, in the dead zone is strongly impaired in the case of strong X-ray luminosities. Additionally, the importance of the star-disk interaction during the Class II phase with respect to the stellar spin evolution is reduced.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a set of controlled hydrodynamical simulations to study the effects of strong galactic outflows on the density and temperature structures, and associated X-ray signatures, of extra-planar and circumgalactic gas. We consider three initial state models, isothermal, isentropic, and rotating cooling-flow, for the hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) into which the outflows are driven. The energy sources are either stellar winds and supernovae, or active galactic nuclei. We consider energy injection rates in the range $10^{40} < \dot{E}_{\rm inj} <10^{44.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and compute the time-dependent soft X-ray (0.5-2 keV) surface brightness. For $\dot{E}_{\rm inj} \gtrsim 10^{41} - 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with the exact threshold depending on the initial CGM state, the X-ray response is dominated by dense hot gas in the forward shock that eventually fades into the CGM as a sound wave. The shock surrounds an inner hot bubble leading to a radial flattening of the X-ray surface brightness. For lower energy injection rates, the X-ray surface brightness of the initial CGM state is almost unaffected. We present analytic approximations for the outflow shock propagation and the associated X-ray emissions.

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate gravity in the non-linear regime of cosmic structure using measurements from Stage-IV surveys, it is imperative to accurately compute large-scale structure observables, such as non-linear matter power spectra, for gravity models that extend beyond general relativity. However, the theoretical predictions of non-linear observables are typically derived from N-body simulations, which demand substantial computational resources. In this study, we introduce a novel public emulator, termed FREmu, designed to provide rapid and precise forecasts of non-linear power spectra specifically for the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity model across scales $0.0089 h \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}<k<0.5 h \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and redshifts $0<z<3$. FREmu leverages Principal Component Analysis and Artificial Neural Networks to establish a mapping from parameters to power spectra, utilizing training data derived from the Quijote-MG simulation suite. With a parameter space encompassing 7 dimensions, including $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_b$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sigma_8$, $M_{\nu}$ and $f_{R_0}$, the emulator achieves an accuracy exceeding 95% for the majority of cases, thus proving to be highly efficient for constraining parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 The present work begins by examining the early-Universe inflationary epoch of a special K-essence model, which incorporates a linear coupling term between the scalar field potential and the canonical Lagrangian. For the power law potential, we both numerically and analytically prove that the inflationary parameters such as the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are compatible with the recent BICEP/Keck observations. Continuing this work, our analysis based on comparing early-Universe observations with late-Universe measurements indicates that the tension on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the growth of structure parameter $S_8$ can be alleviated simultaneously. More precisely, compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, our model can reduce $H_0$ tension to roughly $2.2 \sigma$ and the $S_8$ discrepancy diminishes to $0.82\sigma$.
