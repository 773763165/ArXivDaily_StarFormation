 - **Abstract**
 The escape velocity profile of the Milky Way offers a crucial and independent measurement of its underlying mass distribution and dark matter properties. Using a sample of stars from Gaia DR3 with 6D kinematics and strict quality cuts, we obtain an escape velocity profile of the Milky Way from 4 kpc to 11 kpc in Galactocentric radius. To infer the escape velocity in radial bins, we model the tail of the stellar speed distribution with both traditional power law models and a new functional form that we introduce. While power law models tend to rely on extrapolation to high speeds, we find our new functional form gives the most faithful representation of the observed distribution. Using this for the escape velocity profile, we constrain the properties of the Milky Way's dark matter halo modeled as a Navarro-Frenck-White profile. Combined with constraints from the circular velocity at the solar position, we obtain a concentration and mass of $c_{200\rm{c}}^{\rm{DM}} = 13.9^{+6.2}_{-4.3}$ and $\rm{M}_{200\rm{c}}^{\rm{DM}} = 0.55^{+0.15}_{-0.14}\times 10^{12} M_\odot$. This corresponds to a total Milky Way mass of $\rm{M}_{200\rm{c}} = 0.64^{+0.15}_{-0.14}\times 10^{12} M_\odot$, which is on the low end of the historic range of the Galaxy's mass, but in line with other recent estimates.
#### Migration of low-mass planets in inviscid disks: the effect of radiation  transport on the dynamical corotation torque

 - **Abstract**
 Low-mass planets migrate in the type-I regime. In the inviscid limit, the contrast between the vortensity trapped inside the planet's corotating region and the background disk vortensity leads to a dynamical corotation torque, which is thought to slow down inward migration. We investigate the effect of radiative cooling on low-mass planet migration using inviscid 2D hydrodynamical simulations. We find that cooling induces a baroclinic forcing on material U-turning near the planet, resulting in vortensity growth in the corotating region, which in turn weakens the dynamical corotation torque and leads to 2-3x faster inward migration. This mechanism is most efficient when cooling acts on a timescale similar to the U-turn time of material inside the corotating region, but is nonetheless relevant for a substantial radial range in a typical disk (5-50 au). As the planet migrates inwards, the contrast between the vortensity inside and outside the corotating region increases and partially regulates the effect of baroclinic forcing. As a secondary effect, we show that radiative damping can further weaken the vortensity barrier created by the planet's spiral shocks, supporting inward migration. Finally, we highlight that a self-consistent treatment of radiative diffusion as opposed to local cooling is critical in order to avoid overestimating the vortensity growth and the resulting migration rate.

 - **Abstract**
 All-sky maps of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZ) tend to suffer from systematic features arising from the component separation techniques used to extract the signal. In this work, we investigate one of these methods known as needlet internal linear combination (NILC) and test its performance on simulated data. We show that NILC estimates are strongly affected by the choice of the spatial localization parameter ($\Gamma$), which controls a bias-variance trade-off. Typically, NILC extractions assume a fixed value of $\Gamma$ over the entire sky, but we show there exists an optimal $\Gamma$ that depends on the SZ signal strength and local contamination properties. Then we calculate the NILC solutions for multiple values of $\Gamma$ and feed the results into a neural network to predict the SZ signal. This extraction method, which we call Deep-NILC, is tested against a set of validation data, including recovered radial profiles of resolved systems. Our main result is that Deep-NILC offers significant improvements over choosing fixed values of $\Gamma$.

 - **Abstract**
 Evolved cool stars of various masses are major cosmic engines, delivering substantial mechanical and radiative feedback to the interstellar medium through strong stellar winds and supernova ejecta. These stars play a pivotal role in enriching the interstellar medium with vital chemical elements that constitute the essential building blocks for forming subsequent generations of stars, planets, and potentially even life. Within the complex tapestry of processes occurring in the atmospheres of these cool and luminous stars, convection takes center stage. Convection is a non-local, complex phenomenon marked by non-linear interactions across diverse length scales within a multi-dimensional framework. For these particular stars, characterized by their considerable luminosities and extensive scale heights, convection transitions to a global scale. This transition is facilitated by transmitting radiative energy through the non-uniform outer layers of their atmospheres. To fully understand this phenomenon, the application of global comprehensive 3D radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of stellar convection is of paramount importance. We present two state-of-the-art numerical codes: CO5BOLD and Athena++. Furthermore, we provide a view on their applications as: pivotal roles in enabling a comprehensive investigation into the dynamic processes linked to convection; and critical tools for accurately modeling the emissions produced during shock breakouts in Type II-P Supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent astrometric data of hundreds of millions of stars from Gaia DR3 has allowed a precise determination of the Milky Way rotation curve up to $28$ kpc. The data suggests a rapid decline in the density of dark matter beyond $19$ kpc. We fit the whole rotation curve with four components (gas, disk, bulge and halo) and compute the microlensing optical depth to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). With this model of the galaxy we reanalize the microlensing events of the MACHO and EROS-2 Collaborations. Using their published efficiency function for the duration of their surveys, together with the rate of expected events according to the new density profile, we find that the Dark Matter halo could be composed up to 100\% of massive compact halo objects (MACHOs) for any mass between $0.001$ to $100~M_\odot$, except a narrow range around $0.3~M_\odot$, where it cannot be larger than $\sim30\%$. This result assumes that MACHOs have all the same mass. If these were distributed in an extended mass function like that of the Thermal History Model, the constraints are weakened, allowing 100\% of all DM in the form of Primordial Black Holes.
#### A Uniform Analysis of Debris Disks with the Gemini Planet Imager II:  Constraints on Dust Density Distribution Using Empirically-Informed  Scattering Phase Functions

 - **Abstract**
 Spatially-resolved images of debris disks are necessary to determine disk morphological properties and the scattering phase function (SPF) which quantifies the brightness of scattered light as a function of phase angle. Current high-contrast imaging instruments have successfully resolved several dozens of debris disks around other stars, but few studies have investigated trends in the scattered-light, resolved population of debris disks in a uniform and consistent manner. We have combined Karhunen-Loeve Image Projection (KLIP) with radiative-transfer disk forward modeling in order to obtain the highest quality image reductions and constrain disk morphological properties of eight debris disks imaged by the Gemini Planet Imager at H-band with a consistent and uniformly-applied approach. In describing the scattering properties of our models, we assume a common SPF informed from solar system dust scattering measurements and apply it to all systems. We identify a diverse range of dust density properties among the sample, including critical radius, radial width, and vertical width. We also identify radially narrow and vertically extended disks that may have resulted from substellar companion perturbations, along with a tentative positive trend in disk eccentricity with relative disk width. We also find that using a common SPF can achieve reasonable model fits for disks that are axisymmetric and asymmetric when fitting models to each side of the disk independently, suggesting that scattering behavior from debris disks may be similar to Solar System dust.

 - **Abstract**
 If a galactic supernova explosion occurs in the future, it will be critical to rapidly alert the community to the direction of the supernova by utilizing neutrino signals in order to enable the initiation of follow-up optical observations. In addition, there is anticipation that observation of the diffuse supernova neutrino background will yield discoveries in the near future, given that experimental upper limits are approaching theoretical predictions. We have developed a new supernova event simulator for water Cherenkov neutrino detectors, such as the highly sensitive Super-Kamiokande. This simulator calculates the neutrino interaction in water for the two types of supernova neutrinos described above. Its purpose is to evaluate the precision in determining the location of supernovae and to estimate the expected number of events related to the diffuse supernova neutrino background in Super-Kamiokande. In this paper, we describe the basic structure of the simulator and its demonstration.
#### HAYATE: Photometric redshift estimation by hybridising machine learning  with template fitting

 - **Abstract**
 Machine learning photo-z methods, trained directly on spectroscopic redshifts, provide a viable alternative to traditional template fitting methods but may not generalise well on new data that deviates from that in the training set. In this work, we present a Hybrid Algorithm for WI(Y)de-range photo-z estimation with Artificial neural networks and TEmplate fitting (HAYATE), a novel photo-z method that combines template fitting and data-driven approaches and whose training loss is optimised in terms of both redshift point estimates and probability distributions. We produce artificial training data from low-redshift galaxy SEDs at z<1.3, artificially redshifted up to z=5. We test the model on data from the ZFOURGE surveys, demonstrating that HAYATE can function as a reliable emulator of EAZY for the broad redshift range beyond the region of sufficient spectroscopic completeness. The network achieves precise photo-z estimations with smaller errors ($\sigma_{NMAD}$) than EAZY in the initial low-z region (z<1.3), while being comparable even in the high-z extrapolated regime (1.3<z<5). Meanwhile, it provides more robust photo-z estimations than EAZY with the lower outlier rate ($\eta_{0.2}\lesssim 1\%$) but runs $\sim100$ times faster than the original template fitting method. We also demonstrate HAYATE offers more reliable redshift PDFs, showing a flatter distribution of Probability Integral Transform scores than EAZY. The performance is further improved using transfer learning with spec-z samples. We expect that future large surveys will benefit from our novel methodology applicable to observations over a wide redshift range.

 - **Abstract**
 Axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) are one of the most promising candidates of dark matter (DM). A prevalent method to detect axion-like DM is to seek the periodic oscillation feature in the polarization angles of linearly polarized light emitted from astrophysical sources. In this work, we use the time-resolved polarization measurements of the hyperactive repeating fast radio burst, FRB 20220912A, detected by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to search for extragalactic axion-like DM for the first time. Given a DM density profile of FRB 20220912A's host, we obtain upper limits on the ALP-photon coupling constant of $g_{a \gamma}<(2.9 \times 10^{-11}-1.1\times 10^{-9})\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for the ALP masses $m_a \sim (1.4\times10^{-21}-5.2\times10^{-20})$ eV. Persistent polarimetric observations with FAST would further improve the constraints. We prove that FRBs offer an alternative way to detect axion-like DM on extragalactic distance scales, complementary to other galactic DM probes.
#### On the nature of apparent transient sources on the National Geographic  Society-Palomar Observatory Sky Survey glass copy plates

 - **Abstract**
 We examine critically recent claims for the presence of above-atmosphere optical transients in publicly-available digitised scans of Schmidt telescope photographic plate material derived from the National Geographic Society-Palomar Observatory Sky Survey. We employ the publicly available SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey catalogues to examine statistically the morphology of the sources. We develop a simple, objective and automated image classification scheme based on a random forest decision tree classifier. We find that the putative transients are likely to be spurious artefacts of the photographic emulsion. We suggest a possible cause of the appearance of these images as resulting from the copying procedure employed to disseminate glass copy survey atlas sets in the era before large-scale digitisation programmes.
#### Deciphering Pluto's Haze: How a Solar-Powered Vapor-Pressure Plume  Shapes Its Bimodal Particle Size Distribution

 - **Abstract**
 Combining findings from New Horizons' suite of instruments reveals a bimodal haze particle distribution within Pluto's atmosphere, which haze models have not been able to reproduce. We employ the photochemical and microphysics KINAERO model to simulate seasonal cycles and their impact on the haze distribution. We find that the smaller spherical particle mode can be generated through photochemistry and coagulation, while the larger aggregate mode are formed by surface volatile deposits sublimating and subsequently lofting such particles upwards.
#### Small-scale clustering of Primordial Black Holes: cloud-in-cloud and  exclusion effects

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00600
 - **Abstract**
 Using an excursion-set approach, we revisit the initial spatial clustering of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) originating from the Hubble re-entry of large Gaussian density fluctuations in the early universe. We derive the two-point correlation functions of PBHs, properly accounting for the "cloud-in-cloud" mechanism. Our expressions naturally and intrinsically correlate the formation of pairs of PBHs, which is a key difference with the Poisson model of clustering. Our approach effectively includes short-range exclusion effects and clarifies the clustering behaviors at small scale: PBHs are anti-correlated at short distances. Using a scale-independent collapse threshold, we derive explicit expressions for the excess probability to find pairs of PBHs separated by a distance $r$, as well as the excess probability to find pairs with asymmetric mass ratio. Our framework is model-independent by construction and we discuss possible other applications.

 Most tools for astrophysical research was centered on visual display. Even after some studies shows that the use of sound could help the data analysis, and on the other hand generate more accessibility. This fact motivates the creation of a tool centered on the researcher with and without visual impairments. To carry out this challenge, on this contribution, a theoretical framework based on visual impaired people was created and included on the sonoUno software. After that, the accessibility of the tool was analysed with the ISO standard 9241-171:2008.

 - **Abstract**
 General circulation models (GCMs) are valuable instruments to understand the most peculiar features in the atmospheres of planets and the mechanisms behind their dynamics. Venus makes no exception and it has been extensively studied thanks to GCMs. Here we validate the current version of the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL) Venus GCM, by means of a comparison between the modelled temperature field and that obtained from data by the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) and the Venus Express Radio Science Experiment (VeRa) onboard Venus Express. The modelled thermal structure displays an overall good agreement with data, and the cold collar is successfully reproduced at latitudes higher than +/-55\deg, with an extent and a behavior close to the observed ones. Thermal tides developing in the model appear to be consistent in phase and amplitude with data: diurnal tide dominates at altitudes above 10^2 Pa pressure level and at high-latitudes, while semidiurnal tide dominates between 10^2 and 10^4 Pa, from low to mid-latitudes. The main difference revealed by our analysis is located poleward of 50\deg, where the model is affected by a second temperature inversion arising at 10^3 Pa. This second inversion, possibly related to the adopted aerosols distribution, is not observed in data.
#### Detection of an intranight optical hard-lag with colour variability in  blazar PKS 0735+178

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars are a highly variable subclass of active galactic nuclei that have been observed to vary significantly during a single night. This intranight variability remains a debated phenomenon, with various mechanisms proposed to explain the behaviour including jet energy density evolution or system geometric changes. We present the results of an intranight optical monitoring campaign of four blazars: TXS 0506+056, OJ287, PKS 0735+178, and OJ248 using the Carlos S\'anchez Telescope. We detect significant but colourless behaviour in OJ287 and both bluer- and redder-when-brighter colour trends in PKS 0735+178. Additionally, the g band shows a lag of ~10 min with respect to the r,i,z_s bands for PKS 0735+178 on 2023 January 17. This unexpected hard-lag in PKS 0735+178 is not in accordance with the standard synchrotron shock cooling model (which would predict a soft lag) and instead suggests the variability may be a result of changes in the jet's electron energy density distribution, with energy injection from Fermi acceleration processes into a post-shocked medium.
#### Observational Viability of the Intermediate DBI Inflation in the  Presence of a Minimal Length

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00647
 - **Abstract**
 We consider an intermediate Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) inflationary model in the presence of a minimal measurable length in the theory. We show that, the presence of a minimal measurable length modifies the definitions of the scalar and tensor spectral indices and also other inflation observables. This is due to modification of the momentum and corresponding wave number of the perturbations in the presence of a minimal length. By using the deformed definition of the scalar and tensor spectral indices, we perform numerical analysis on the intermediate DBI inflation model to find some constraints on the deformation parameter. In this regard, we compare our numerical results with both Planck2018 TT, TE, EE +lowE +lensing +BAO+ BK14 and Planck2018 TT, TE,EE +lowE+lensing+BK14 +BAO+LIGO $\&$ Virgo2016 data at the $68\%$ CL and $95\%$ CL. Our numerical study shows that the intermediate DBI inflation model in the presence of a minimal measurable length is observationally viable if the upper bound on the deformation parameter to be considered of the order of $10^{48}$ at $68\%$ CL and $10^{49}$ at $95\%$ CL. This is consistent with the results of other approaches to constrain such a quantity.
#### Potential Vorticity of the South Polar Vortex of Venus

 - **Abstract**
 Venus' atmosphere shows highly variable warm vortices over both of the planet's poles. The nature of the mechanism behind their formation and properties is still unknown. Potential vorticity is a conserved quantity when advective processes dominate over friction and diabatic heating, and is a quantity frequently used to model balanced flows. As a step toward understanding the vortices' dynamics, we present maps of Ertel's potential vorticity (EPV) at Venus' south polar region. We analyze three configurations of the South Polar Vortex at the upper cloud level ($P\sim 240 mbar$; $z\sim 58 km$), based on our previous analyses of cloud motions and thermal structure from data acquired by the VIRTIS instrument onboard Venus Express. Additionally, we tentatively estimate EPV at the lower cloud level ($P\sim 2200 mbar$; $z\sim 43 km$), based on our previous wind measurements and on static stability data from Pioneer Venus and the VIRA model. Values of EPV are on the order of $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-8} K m^2 kg^{-1} s^{-1}$ at the upper and lower cloud levels, respectively, being 3 times larger than the estimated errors. The morphology observed in EPV maps is mainly determined by the structures of the vertical component of the relative vorticity. This is in contrast to the vortex's morphology observed in 3.8 or 5 $\mu m$ images which are related to the thermal structure of the atmosphere at the cloud top. Some of the EPV maps point to a weak ringed structure in the upper cloud while a more homogenous EPV field is found in the lower cloud.
#### Neutral carbon in diffuse interstellar medium: abundance matching with  H2 for DLAs at high redshifts

 - **Abstract**
 We present the study of CI/H$_2$ relative abundance in the diffuse cold neutral medium. Using the chemical and thermal balance model we calculated the dependence of CI/H$_2$ on the main parameters of the medium: hydrogen number density, metallicity, strength of the UV field, and cosmic ray ionization rate (CRIR). We show that observed relative CI and H$_2$ column densities in damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs) at high redshifts can be reproduced within our model assuming the typically expected conditions in the diffuse cold neutral medium (CNM). Using the additional observed information the on metallicity, HI column density, and excitation of CI fine-structure levels, as well as temperature we estimated for a wide range metallicities in the CNM at high redshifts that CRIRs to be in the range from $\sim10^{-16}$ to $\rm few \times 10^{-15}\rm s^{-1}$, hydrogen number densities to be in range $\sim10 - 10^3$cm$^{-3}$, and UV field in range from $10^{-2}$ to $\rm few \times 10^2$ of Mathis field. We argue, that since the observed quantities used in this work are quite homogeneous and much less affected by the radiative transfer effects (in comparison with e.g. dissociation of HD and UV pumping of H$_2$ rotational levels) our estimates are quite robust against the assumption of the exact geometrical model of the cloud and local sources of the UV field.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new grid of cloudy atmosphere and evolution models for substellar objects. These models include the effect of refractory cloud species, including silicate clouds, on the spectra and evolution. We include effective temperatures from 900 to 2400 K and surface gravities from log g=3.5-5.5, appropriate for a broad range of objects with masses between 1 and 84 Jupiter masses. Model pressure-temperature structures are calculated assuming radiative-convective and chemical equilibrium. We consider the effect of both clouds and metallicity on the atmospheric structure, resulting spectra, and thermal evolution of substellar worlds. We parameterize clouds using the Ackerman & Marley (2001) cloud model, including cloud parameter fsed values from 1-8; we include three metallicities (-0.5, 0.0, and +0.5). Refractory clouds and metallicity both alter the evolution of substellar objects, changing the inferred temperature at a given age by up to 100-200 K. We compare to the observed photometry of brown dwarfs, finding broad agreement with the measured photometry. We publish the spectra, evolution, and other data products online with open access.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, two models of interest for Celestial Mechanics are presented and analysed, using both analytic and numerical techniques, from the point of view of the possible presence of regular and/or chaotic motion, as well as the stability of the considered orbits. The first model, presented in a Hamiltonian formalism, can be used to describe the motion of a satellite around the Earth, taking into account both the non-spherical shape of our planet and the third-body gravitational influence of Sun and Moon. Using semi-analytical techniques coming from Normal Form and Nekhoroshev theories it is possible to provide stability estimates for the orbital elements of its geocentric motion. The second dynamical system presented can be used as a simplified model to describe the motion of a particle in an elliptic galaxy having a central massive core, and is constructed as a refraction billiard where an inner dynamics, induced by a Keplerian potential, is coupled with an external one, where a harmonic oscillator-type potential is considered. The investigation of the dynamics is carried on by using tools of ODEs' theory and is focused on studying the trajectories' properties in terms of periodicity, stability and, possibly, chaoticity.

 - **Abstract**
 The interaction between dark matter and dark energy can be incorporated into field theory models of dark energy that have proved successful in alleviating the coincidence problem. We review recent advances in this field, including new models and constraints from different astronomical data sets. We show that interactions are allowed by observations and can reduce the current tensions among different measurements of cosmological parameters. We extend our discussion to include constraints from non-linear effects and results from cosmological simulations. Finally, we discuss forthcoming multi-messenger data from current and future observational facilities that will help to improve our understanding of the interactions within the dark sector.

 - **Abstract**
 We present MIRI MRS observations of the large, multi-gapped protoplanetary disk around the T-Tauri star AS 209. The observations reveal hundreds of water vapor lines from 4.9 to 25.5 $\mu$m towards the inner $\sim1$ au in the disk, including the first detection of ro-vibrational water emission in this disk. The spectrum is dominated by hot ($\sim800$ K) water vapor and OH gas, with only marginal detections of CO$_2$, HCN, and a possible colder water vapor component. Using slab models with a detailed treatment of opacities and line overlap, we retrieve the column density, emitting area, and excitation temperature of water vapor and OH, and provide upper limits for the observable mass of other molecules. Compared to MIRI spectra of other T-Tauri disks, the inner disk of AS 209 does not appear to be atypically depleted in CO$_2$ nor HCN. Based on \textit{Spitzer IRS} observations, we further find evidence for molecular emission variability over a 10-year baseline. Water, OH, and CO$_2$ line luminosities have decreased by factors 2-4 in the new MIRI epoch, yet there are minimal continuum emission variations. The origin of this variability is yet to be understood.
