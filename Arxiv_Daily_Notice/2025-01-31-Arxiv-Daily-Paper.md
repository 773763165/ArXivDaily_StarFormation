 - **Abstract**
 DESTINY+ is a planned JAXA medium-class Epsilon mission from Earth to deep space using a low-thrust, many-revolution orbit. Such a trajectory design is a challenging problem not only for trajectory design but also for flight operations, and in particular, it is essential to evaluate the impact of operational uncertainties to ensure mission success. In this study, we design the low-thrust trajectory from Earth orbit to a lunar transfer orbit by differential dynamic programming using the Sundman transformation. The results of Monte Carlo simulations with operational uncertainties confirm that the spacecraft can be successfully guided to the lunar transfer orbit by using the feedback control law of differential dynamic programming in the angular domain.

 - **Abstract**
 Frankel et al (2020) reported that the rate of diffusion in angular momentum by stars in the disk of the Milky Way was about ten times faster than the rate of heating, which places a stringent requirement on the nature of disk star scattering. In a recent posting, Hamilton et al (2024) integrated orbits of test particles in a Galactic model that included transient spirals, and found that the ratio of the rates heating to radial migration in their calculations was generally larger than reported by Frankel et al. They concluded that the observed slow heating rate poses a significant challenge to dynamical models of the Milky Way and seemed to require revision of our current theories of spiral structure. Here we show that that our earlier models of radial migration we published in 2002, after correction for 3D motion, account naturally for the finding of Frankel et al, but leave little room for additional heating by mechanisms other than transient spirals.

 - **Abstract**
 In the age of large-scale galaxy and lensing surveys, such as DESI, Euclid, Roman and Rubin, we stand poised to usher in a transformative new phase of data-driven cosmology. To fully harness the capabilities of these surveys, it is critical to constrain the poorly understood influence of baryon feedback physics on the matter power spectrum. We investigate the use of a powerful and novel cosmological probe - fast radio bursts (FRBs) - to capture baryonic effects on the matter power spectrum, leveraging simulations from the CAMELS projects, including IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, and Astrid. We find that FRB statistics exhibit a strong correlation, independet of the subgrid model and cosmology, with quantities known to encapsulate baryonic impacts on the matter power spectrum, such as baryon spread and the halo baryon fraction. We propose an innovative method utilizing FRB observations to quantify the effects of feedback physics and enhance weak lensing measurements of $S_{8}$. We outline the necessary steps to prepare for the imminent detection of large FRB populations in the coming years, focusing on understanding the redshift evolution of FRB observables and mitigating the effects of cosmic variance.

          Testing the local void solution to the Hubble tension using baryon acoustic oscillation measurements over the last twenty years

 - **Abstract**
 A promising solution to the Hubble tension is a local void that is roughly 20% underdense out to 300 Mpc, as suggested by galaxy number counts in the near-infrared. Gravitationally driven outflows from this KBC void might inflate redshifts enough to solve the Hubble tension, a scenario explored in detail by Haslbauer et al. We obtain predictions for the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) observables in their best-fitting void models and a control model that assumes the homogeneous $Planck$ cosmology. We compare these models against our compilation of available BAO measurements from the past twenty years. We find that the quality and quantity of available measurements are best using the isotropically averaged distance $D_V$. Taking its ratio with the expected value in the control model yields good agreement with unity at high redshift, but a discrepancy appears that systematically grows with decreasing redshift. Assuming independent uncertainties, the 41 considered $D_V$ observations give a total $\chi^2$ of 70.5 for the control void-free model, while the void models give only $44.8 - 46.7$ depending on the density profile. This represents a reduction in overall tension from $3.0\sigma$ without a void to $1.0\sigma - 1.2\sigma$ in the void models. The $\chi^2$ differences are smaller when considering measurements of the angular BAO scale or its redshift depth, but the void-free model provides the worst fit in all cases. Overall, our results suggest that recent hints of BAO observables deviating from expectations in the homogeneous $Planck$ cosmology could indicate a local void, which was motivated by considerations unrelated to BAO data or the Hubble tension.

          Ultraviolet spectroscopy of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 across a state transition

 - **Abstract**
 We present ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopic observations covering three distinct accretion states of the low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) MAXI J1820+070: the luminous hard state, a hard-intermediate state and the soft state. Our observations were obtained during the 2018 eruption of MAXI J1820+070 with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and AstroSat observatory. The extinction towards the source turns out to be low - $\rm E_{B-V} = 0.2 \pm 0.05$ - making it one of the best UV accretion laboratories among LMXBs. Remarkably, we observe only moderate differences between all three states, with all spectra displaying similar continuum shapes and emission lines. Moreover, the continua are not well-described by physically plausible irradiated disc models. All of this challenges the standard reprocessing picture for UV emission from erupting LMXBs. The UV emission lines are double-peaked, with high-ionization lines displaying higher peak-to-peak velocities. None of the lines display obvious outflow signatures, even though blue-shifted absorption features have been seen in optical and near-infrared lines during the hard state. The emission line ratios are consistent with normal abundances, suggesting that the donor mass at birth was low enough to avoid CNO processing ($\rm M_{2,i} \lesssim 1.0 - 1.5 {\mathrm M_{\odot}}$). Finally, we study the evolution of UV variability in our time-resolved HST observations (hard and hard-intermediate states). All UV power spectra can be modelled with a broken power-law, superposed on which we tentatively detect the $\simeq 18$s quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) that has been seen in other spectral bands.

 - **Abstract**
 Rare events of large-scale spatially-correlated exponential random fields are studied. The influence of spatial correlations on clustering and non-sphericity is investigated. The size of the performed simulations permits to study beyond-$7.5$-sigma events ($1$ in $10^{13}$). As an application, this allows to resolve individual Hubble patches which fulfill the condition for primordial black hole formation. It is argued that their mass spectrum is drastically altered due to co-collapse of clustered overdensities as well as the mutual threshold-lowering through the latter. Furthermore, the corresponding non-sphericities imply possibly large changes in the initial black hole spin distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the small-scale spatial variation in cool ($T\sim 10^4 K$) Mg II absorption detected in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of a star-forming galaxy at $z\approx 0.8$. The CGM of this galaxy is probed by a spatially extended bright background gravitationally lensed arc at $z = 2.76$. The background arc continuously samples the CGM of the foreground galaxy at a range of impact parameters between 54-66 kpc. The Mg II absorption strengths vary by more than a factor of two within these ranges. A power-law fit to the fractional variation of absorption strengths yields a coherence length of 2.7 kpc within these absorption lines. This suggests a high degree of spatial coherence in the CGM of this galaxy. The host galaxy is driving a strong galactic outflow with a mean outflow velocity $\approx$ -179 km/s and mass outflow rate $\dot{M}_{out}\geq 64_{-27}^{+31} M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$ traced by blueshifted Mg II and Fe II absorption lines. The galaxy itself has a spatially extended emission halo with a maximum spatial extent of $\approx$ 33 kpc traced by [O II], [O III] and $H\beta$ emission lines. The extended emission halo shows kinematic signatures of co-rotating halo-gas with solar metallicity. Taken together, these observations suggest evidence of a baryon cycle that is recycling the outflowing gas to form the next generation of stars.

          Tracing the Inner Edge of the Habitable Zone with Sulfur Chemistry

 - **Abstract**
 The circumstellar liquid-water habitable zone guides our search for potentially inhabited exoplanets, but remains observationally untested. We show that the inner edge of the habitable zone can now be mapped among exoplanets using their lack of surface water, which, unlike the presence of water, can be unambiguously revealed by atmospheric sulfur species. Using coupled climate-chemistry modelling we find that the observability of sulfur-gases on exoplanets depends critically on the ultraviolet (UV) flux of their host star, a property with wide variation: most M-dwarfs have a low UV flux and thereby allow the detection of sulfur-gases as a tracer of dry planetary surfaces; however, the UV flux of Trappist-1 may be too high for sulfur to disambiguate uninhabitable from habitable surfaces on any of its planets. We generalise this result to show how a population-level search for sulfur-chemistry on M-dwarf planets can be used to empirically define the Habitable Zone in the near-future.

 - **Abstract**
 Complex organic molecules (COMs) are widely detected in protostellar and protoplanetary systems, where they are thought to have been inherited in large part from earlier evolutionary phases. The chemistry of COMs in these earlier phases, namely starless and prestellar cores, remains poorly understood, as models often struggle to reproduce the observed gas-phase abundances of these species. We simulate the formation of a molecular cloud, and the cores within it, out of the diffuse interstellar medium, and follow the chemical evolution of the cloud material starting from purely-atomic initial conditions. We find that the formation of both gas- and ice-phase COMs precedes the formation of cores as distinct objects, beginning at gas densities of a few $10^3 \,{\rm cm}^{-3}$. Much of this COM-enriched material remains at these relatively modest densities for several Myr, which may provide a reservoir for accretion onto planet-forming discs in later evolutionary stages. We suggest that models of core and disc chemistry should not ignore the complex dynamical evolution which precedes these structures, even when studying supposedly late-forming molecules such as CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars play a very important role in many astrophysical fields. Yet, some fundamental aspects of their evolution remain poorly constrained. In this regard, there is an open debate on the width of the main-sequence (MS) phase. We aim to create an updated Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram that includes a volume-limited and statistically significant sample of massive stars. Our goal is to use this sample to investigate the extension of the MS, including information about projected rotational velocities ($v\sin i$) and the spectroscopic binary status. We combine spectroscopic parameters derived with FASTWIND stellar atmosphere code and Gaia distances to obtain stellar parameters for 876 Galactic luminous O- and B-type stars gathered within the IACOB project. We use the ${\tt iacob-broad}$ tool to derive $v\sin i$ estimates and multi-epoch spectra to identify single/double-line spectroscopic binaries (SB1/SB2). We present an HR diagram for 670 stars located within 2500pc balancing completeness and number. We evaluate the extension of the MS in terms of the drop in the relative number of stars as a function of effective temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$). We find a consistent boundary at $\approx$22.5kK within the full range of luminosities that we use to delineate the terminal-age main sequence (TAMS). We obtain a smooth decrease of the highest $v\sin i$ with $T_{\rm eff}$ along the MS, likely limited by the critical velocity. We consider this effect combined with a lower expected fraction of stars beyond the MS as the best explanation for the lack of fast-rotating objects in the post-MS region. Our results favor low to mild initial rotation for the full sample and a binary past for the tail of fast-rotating stars. The prominence of SB1/SB2 systems in the MS, and the 25% decrease in the relative fraction of SB1 systems when crossing the TAMS can further delineate its location.

 - **Abstract**
 Developing algorithms to search through data efficiently is a challenging part of searching for signs of technology beyond our solar system. We have built a digital signal processing system and computer cluster on the backend of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico in order to search for signals throughout the Galaxy consistent with our understanding of artificial radio emissions. In our first paper, we described the system design and software pipelines. In this paper, we describe a postprocessing pipeline to identify persistent sources of interference, filter out false positives, and search for signals not immediately identifiable as anthropogenic radio frequency interference during the VLA Sky Survey. As of 01 September 2024, the Commensal Open-source Multi-mode Interferometric Cluster had observed more than 950,000 unique pointings. This paper presents the strategy we employ when commensally observing during the VLA Sky Survey and a postprocessing strategy for the data collected during the survey. To test this postprocessing pipeline, we searched toward 511 stars from the $Gaia$ catalog with coherent beams. This represents about 30 minutes of observation during VLASS, where we typically observe about 2000 sources per hour in the coherent beamforming mode. We did not detect any unidentifiable signals, setting isotropic power limits ranging from 10$^{11}$ to 10$^{16}$W.

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical integral field unit (IFU) observations of the Mystic Mountains, a dust pillar complex in the center of the Carina Nebula that is heavily irradiated by the nearby young massive cluster Trumpler 14. With the continuous spatial and spectral coverage of data from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE), we measure the physical properties in the ionized gas including the electron density and temperature, excitation, and ionization. MUSE also provides an excellent view of the famous jets HH 901, 902, and 1066, revealing them to be high-density, low-ionization outflows despite the harsh environment. HH 901 shows spatially extended [C I] emission tracing the rapid dissociation of the photoevaporating molecular outflow in this highly irradiated source. We compute the photoevaporation rate of the Mystic Mountains and combine it with recent ALMA observations of the cold molecular gas to estimate the remaining lifetime of the Mystic Mountains and the corresponding shielding time for the embedded protostars. The longest remaining lifetimes are for the smallest structures, suggesting that they have been compressed by ionizing feedback. Our data do not suggest that star formation in the Mystic Mountains has been triggered but it does point to the role that ionization-driven compression may play in enhancing the shielding of embedded stars and disks. Planet formation models suggest that the shielding time is a strong determinant of the mass and orbital architecture of planets, making it important to quantify in high-mass regions like Carina that represent the type of environment where most stars form.

          Mapping the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario to $f(T)$ modified gravity: Effects on structure growth rate

 - **Abstract**
 The concept of a rapidly sign-switching cosmological constant, interpreted as a mirror AdS-dS transition in the late universe and known as the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, has significantly improved the fit to observational data, offering a promising framework for alleviating major cosmological tensions such as the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. However, when considered within general relativity, this scenario does not predict any effects on the evolution of the matter density contrast beyond modifications to the background functions. In this work, we propose a new gravitational model in which the background dynamics predicted by the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM framework are mapped into $f(T)$ gravity, dubbed $f(T)-\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, rendering the models indistinguishable at the background level. However, in this new scenario, the sign-switching cosmological constant dynamics modify the evolution of linear matter perturbations through an effective gravitational constant, $G_{\rm eff}$. We investigate the evolution of the growth rate and derive new observational constraints for this scenario using RSD measurements. We also present new constraints in the standard $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM case, incorporating the latest Type Ia supernovae data samples available in the literature, along with BAO data from DESI. Our findings indicate that the new corrections expected at the linear perturbative level, as revealed through RSD samples, can provide significant evidence in favor of this new scenario. Additionally, this model may be an excellent candidate for resolving the current $S_8$ tension.

          Evolution of X-ray Gas in SN 1987A from 2007 to 2021: Ring Fading and Ejecta Brightening Unveiled through Differential Emission Measure Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 As the nearest supernova (SN) observed since Kepler's SN of 1604, SN 1987A provides an unprecedented opportunity to study in detail the early evolution of supernova remnants (SNRs). Despite extensive studies through both observations and simulations, there is still an urgent need for a more effective approach to integrate the results from two sides. In this study, we conducted a detailed differential emission measure (DEM) analysis on the XMM-Newton observations taken in 2007 to 2021 to characterize the continuous temperature structure of SN 1987A, which can be better compared with simulations. The X-ray plasma exhibit a temperature distribution with a major peak at $\sim0.5$-$1$ keV and a high-temperature tail extending to $\gtrsim5$ keV. The emission measure (EM) of the major peak started to decline around 2014, while the EM of the tail continued increasing and appears to have formed a secondary peak at $\sim3$-$5$ keV in recent years. Our DEM results consistent well with simulations, which help to further identify the major peak as originating from the equatorial ring and the secondary peak as arising from the newly shocked ejecta. Together with the simulations, our DEM analysis reveals recent fading of the ring and brightening of the ejecta in X-rays from SN 1987A. Additionally, we observed a recent decrease in the centroid energy of Fe K line, providing further evidence of newly shocked ejecta.

          Unusual X-ray Oxygen Line Ratios of SN 1987A Arising From the Absorption of Galactic Hot Interstellar Medium

 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic studies have revealed unusual oxygen line ratios, such as the high O VII forbidden-to-resonance ratio, in several supernova remnants. While the physical origin is still under debate, for most of them, it has been suggested that this phenomenon arises from either charge exchange (CX) or resonant scattering (RS). In this work, we report the high O VII G-ratio ($\gtrsim1$) and high O VIII Ly$\beta$/Ly$\alpha$ ratio ($\gtrsim0.2$) found in multiepoch XMM-Newton RGS observations of SN 1987A. The line ratios cannot be fully explained by non-equilibrium ionization effects, CX, or RS. We suggest the absorption of foreground hot gas as the most likely origin, which plays the major role in modifying line fluxes and line ratios. Based on this scenario, we introduced two Gaussian absorption components at the O VII resonance line and the O VIII Ly$\alpha$ line and constrained the optical depth of the two lines as $\tau_{\rm OVII}\sim0.6$ and $\tau_{\rm OVIII}\sim0.2$. We estimated the temperature as $kT_{\rm e}\sim0.18$ keV and the oxygen column density as $N_{\rm O}\sim0.8\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the absorbing gas, which is consistent with the hot interstellar medium in the Galactic halo. Neglecting this absorption component may lead to an underestimation {of} the O abundance. We revised the O abundance of SN 1987A, which is increased by $\sim20\%$ compared with previous results. The N/O ratio by number of atoms is revised to be $\sim1.2$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present constraints on the baryonic matter density parameter, $\Omega_b$, within the framework of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our analysis utilizes observational data on the effective optical depth from high-redshift quasars. To parameterize the photoionization rate $\Gamma_{-12}$, we employ a Bézier polynomial. Additionally, we approximate the Hubble parameter at high redshifts as $H(z)\approx 100h\Omega_m^{1/2} (1+z)^{3/2}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Confidence regions are obtained with $h=0.701\pm0.013$ and $\Omega_m = 0.315$, optimized by the Planck mission. The best-fit values are $\Omega_b =0.043^{+0.005}_{-0.006}$ and $\Omega_b = 0.045^{+0.004}_{-0.006}$, corresponding to an old data set and a new data set, respectively. And we test the non-parametric form of $\Gamma_{-12}$, obtaining $\Omega_b = 0.048^{+0.001}_{-0.003}$. These results are consistent with the findings of Planck at the 1 $\sigma$ confidence level. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of quasar datasets in constraining $\Omega_b$, eliminating the need for independent photoionization rate data. This approach provides detailed cosmic information about baryon density and the photoionization history of the intergalactic medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep learning and convolutional neural networks in particular are powerful and promising tools for cosmological analysis of large-scale structure surveys. They are already providing similar performance to classical analysis methods using fixed summary statistics, are showing potential to break key degeneracies by better probe combination and will likely improve rapidly in the coming years as progress is made in the physical modelling through both software and hardware improvement. One key issue remains: unlike classical analysis, a convolutional neural network's decision process is hidden from the user as the network optimises millions of parameters with no direct physical meaning. This prevents a clear understanding of the potential limitations and biases of the analysis, making it hard to rely on as a main analysis method. In this work, we explore the behaviour of such a convolutional neural network through a novel method. Instead of trying to analyse a network a posteriori, i.e. after training has been completed, we study the impact on the constraining power of training the network and predicting parameters with degraded data where we removed part of the information. This allows us to gain an understanding of which parts and features of a large-scale structure survey are most important in the network's prediction process. We find that the network's prediction process relies on a mix of both Gaussian and non-Gaussian information, and seems to put an emphasis on structures whose scales are at the limit between linear and non-linear regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the implications of incorporating an Anti-de Sitter (AdS) vacua in the Dark Energy (DE) sector using the recent DESI BAO measurements in combination with Planck-2018 CMB, Pantheon-Plus(+SH0ES) supernovae and KiDS weak lensing data. We show that the presence of a {\it Negative Cosmological Constant} ($\Lambda < 0$, nCC) together with an evolving part (modelled by the CPL parametrisation) in DE sector allows a {\it non-phantom} region for the DE in the constrained parameter space consistent with different observational data. This essentially solves the problem of {\it phantom} behaviour in the DE sector which is difficult to obtain through reasonable field theory. The implications nCC in the DE sector for different cosmological tensions are also studied. Our findings highlight the importance of the presence of AdS in the DE sector for theoretical model building, especially in the context of quantum gravity theories, e.g. string theory.

At the background level, we find consistency with the quintom dynamics for different data combinations and divide the characteristics of dark energy into three different categories, which are negative-energy dark energy, late-dominated dark energy and oscillating dark energy, respectively. Considering the effect of modified gravity on the growth of matter perturbations, the reconstruction results at the perturbative level show that we only need minor corrections to general relativity. Furthermore, we provide theoretical interpretation for the three different types of dynamical dark-energy behavior, in the framework of modified gravity, scalar fields, and dark-energy equation-of-state parametrizations. Finally, we show that all of these models can be unified in the framework of effective field theory.

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate spectra of kilonovae in the NLTE phase (t >=1week), we perform atomic calculations for dielectronic (DR) and radiative (RR) recombination rates for the light r-process elements: Se (Z = 34), Rb (Z = 37), Sr (Z = 38), Y (Z = 39), and Zr (Z = 40) using the HULLAC code. For the different elements, our results for the total rate coefficients for recombining from the ionization states of II to I, III to II, and IV to III vary between 10^{-13}-10^{-9} cm^3/s, 10^{-12}-10^{-10} cm^3/s, and 10^{-13}-10^{-10} cm^3/s, respectively, at a temperature of T = 10,000 K. We also provide fits to the ground state photoionization cross sections of the various ions, finding larger and more slowly declining values with energy in comparison to the hydrogenic approximation. Using this new atomic data, we study the impact on kilonova model spectra at phases of t = 10 days and t = 25 days using the spectral synthesis code SUMO. Compared to models using the previous treatment of recombination as a constant rate, the new models show significant changes in ionization and temperature, and correspondingly, in emergent spectra. With the new rates, we find that Zr (Z = 40) plays a yet more dominant role in kilonova spectra for light r-process compositions. Further, we show that previously predicted mid-infrared (e.g. [Se III] 4.55 \mum) and optical (e.g. [Rb I] 7802, 7949 A) lines disappear in the new model. Instead a strong [Se I] line is seen to be emerging at \lambda=5.03 \mum. These results demonstrate the importance of considering the detailed microphysics for modelling and interpreting the late-time kilonova spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 Utilising JWST, ALMA and the VLA we present high angular resolution (0.06''- 0.42''), multi-wavelength (4 micron - 3cm) observations of the VLA 1623-2417 protostellar system to characterise the origin, morphology and, properties of the continuum emission. JWST observations at 4.4 micron reveal outflow cavities for VLA 1623 A and, for the first time, VLA 1623 B, as well as scattered light from the upper layers of the VLA 1623 W disk. We model the millimetre-centimetre spectral energy distributions to quantify the relative contributions of dust and ionised gas emission, calculate dust masses, and use spectral index maps to determine where optical depth hinders this analysis. In general, all objects appear to be optically thick down to ~90 GHz, show evidence for significant amounts (10's - 100's M_Earth) of large (>1 mm) dust grains, and are dominated by ionised gas emission for frequencies ~<15 GHz. In addition, we find evidence of unsettled millimetre dust in the inclined disk of VLA 1623 B possibly attributed to instabilities within the circumstellar disk, adding to the growing catalogue of unsettled Class 0/I disks. Our results represent some of the highest resolution observations possible with current instrumentation, particularly in the case of the VLA. However, our interpretation is still limited at low frequencies (~<22 GHz) and thus motivates the need for next-generation interferometers operating at centimetre wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) such as NANOGrav, EPTA, PPTA, and CPTA suggest the presence of nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). While such signals could be explained by gravitational waves from a network of metastable cosmic strings (CSs), standard scenarios involving the Kibble-Zurek mechanism triggered by a thermal potential face significant challenges. Specifically, these scenarios predict a GWB spectrum inconsistent with the non-detection at higher frequencies by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) for CSs with relatively large string tension. It is also difficult to prevent the monopole forming phase transition just before the CS forming symmetry breaking, which spoils the CS network formation. In contrast, a delayed scaling scenario, where the CSs start to emit GWs at a later time due to the dilution during inflation, alleviates these issues. This scenario allows for a larger string tension while monopoles are sufficiently diluted such that the CS network safely forms. In this study, we clarify the spectrum of stochastic GWB from metastable CSs in the delayed scaling scenario, consistent with the PTA observations while satisfying the LVK constraints. Furthermore, we explore its potential signatures at frequencies accessible to other detectors such as LVK as well as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin or DECIGO and BBO. We also discuss the implications on inflation and underlying UV theories, such as the grand unified theories.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: How planets form in protoplanetary disks and what drives the formation of their seeds is still a major unknown. It is an accepted theory that multiple processes can trap dusty material in radially narrow rings or vortex-like structures, preventing the dust from drifting inwards. However, the relevant process for clumping this dusty material until it collapses under gravity still needs to be identified. One promising candidate is the streaming instability arising from the aerodynamic interaction between dust and gas once they reach similar densities. Aims: We investigate with a global disk model based on recent observational constraints if streaming instability can form dust clumps, which might gravitationally collapse. Further, our goal is to verify the observability of the produced structures using ALMA or ngVLA. Methods. For the first time, we present global 2D (R, z) hydrodynamic simulations using FARGO3D in which the dust is treated as a pressureless fluid. The disk model assumes stratification, realistic boundary conditions, and meaningful resolution to resolve the fast-growing modes. We choose two values for the total dust-to-gas mass ratio Z = 0.01 and Z = 0.02, compare the maximum clump density to the local Hill density, and compute the optical depth of the dust disk. Results: With a dust-to-gas mass ratio of Z = 0.01, we confirm previous streaming instability simulations, not showing the ability to form strong concentrations of dust clumps. With Z = 0.02, dense clumps form within 20 orbits, however reaching only 30% of the Hill density even following disk parameters from the massive protoplanetary disks GM Aur, HD163296, IM Lup, MWC 480, and TW Hya, which all share astonishingly similar surface density profiles.

 - **Abstract**
 The investigation of the isotopic ratio of interstellar nitrogen -- $^{14}$N versus $^{15}$N -- is done, for explaining its variations observed for N2H+ in different interstellar and Solar environments. The goal is to produce cross sections and rate coefficients for electron impact dissociative recombination for different isotopologues of N$_2$H$^+$, since it was envisioned as a novel source that can lead to nitrogen fractionation. We calculate dissociative recombination cross sections and rate coefficients using the normal mode approximation combined with the R-matrix theory and vibronic frame transformation within the multichannel quantum defect theory for eight isotopologues containing both $^{14}$N, $^{15}$N and H, D. Our calculations show that the relative differences respective to the main isotopologue ($^{14}$N$_2$H$^+$) is below 1% for the hydrogen containing isotopologues, but reaches almost 30% for the heaviest deuterated isotopologue, leading us to the conclusion that according to the present status of the theory, dissociative recombination is not responsible for the peculiar $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N isotopic ratios of N$_2$H$^+$ observed in the different interstellar molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 Here we report on the identification of the three fastest rotating Jovian Trojans with reliable population assignment, using light curve data from the Transiting Exoplanet Satellite Survey mission, also confirmed by Zwicky Transient Facility data. For two of our targets the rotation periods are moderately below the previously accepted ~5 h Jovian Trojan breakup limit (4.26 and 4.75 h), however, the rotation period of (13383) was found to be P = 2.926 h, leading to a density estimate of $\rho$ $\approx$ 1.6 $g cm^{-3}$, higher than the generally accepted $\leq$ 1 $g cm^{-3}$ density limit of Jovian Trojans. If associated with lower densities, this rotation rate requires considerable cohesion in the order of a few kPa. The relatively high albedo (pV $\approx$ 0.11) and fast rotation suggest that (13383) may have undergone an energetic collision that spun up the body and exposed bright material to the surface.

 - **Abstract**
 Sub-Neptunes are the most common type of planet in our galaxy. Interior structure models suggest that the coldest sub-Neptunes could host liquid water oceans underneath their hydrogen envelopes - sometimes called 'hycean' planets. JWST transmission spectra of the $\sim$ 250 K sub-Neptune K2-18 b were recently used to report detections of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$, alongside weaker evidence of (CH$_3$)$_2$S (dimethyl sulfide, or DMS). Atmospheric CO$_2$ was interpreted as evidence for a liquid water ocean, while DMS was highlighted as a potential biomarker. However, these notable claims were derived using a single data reduction and retrieval modeling framework, which did not allow for standard robustness tests. Here we present a comprehensive reanalysis of K2-18 b's JWST NIRISS SOSS and NIRSpec G395H transmission spectra, including the first analysis of the second-order NIRISS SOSS data. We incorporate multiple well-tested data reduction pipelines and retrieval codes, spanning 60 different data treatments and over 250 atmospheric retrievals. We confirm the detection of CH$_4$ ($\approx$ 4$\sigma$), with a volume mixing ratio of log CH$_4$ = $-1.15^{+0.40}_{-0.52}$, but we find no statistically significant or reliable evidence for CO$_2$ or DMS. Finally, we quantify the observed atmospheric composition using photochemical-climate and interior models, demonstrating that our revised composition of K2-18 b can be explained by an oxygen-poor mini-Neptune without requiring a liquid water surface or life.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars provide an ideal theoretical framework for exploring fundamental physics when nuclear matter surpasses densities encountered within atomic nuclei. Despite their paramount importance, uncertainties in the equation of state (EoS) have shrouded their internal structure. For rotating neutron stars, the shape of their surface is contingent upon the EoS and the rotational dynamics. This work proposes new universal relations regarding the star's surface, employing machine-learning techniques for regression. More specifically, we developed highly accurate universal relations for a neutron star's eccentricity, the star's ratio of the polar to the equatorial radius, and the effective gravitational acceleration at both the pole and the equator. Furthermore, we propose an accurate theoretical formula for $(d\log R(\mu)/d\theta)_{\max}$. This research addresses key astronomical aspects by utilizing these global parameters as features for the training phase of a neural network. Along the way, we introduce new effective parameterizations for each star's global surface characteristics. Our regression methodology enables accurate estimations of the star's surface $R(\mu)$, its corresponding logarithmic derivative $d\log R(\mu)/d\theta$, and its effective acceleration due to gravity $g(\mu)$ with accuracy better than $1 \%$. The analysis is performed for an extended sample of rotating configurations constructed using a large ensemble of 70 tabulated hadronic, hyperonic, and hybrid EoS models that obey the current multimessenger constraints and cover a wide range of stiffnesses. Above all, the suggested relations could provide an accurate framework for the star's surface estimation using data acquired from the NICER X-ray telescope or future missions, and constrain the EoS of nuclear matter when measurements of the relevant observables become available.

          Variability of the UV luminosity function with SPICE

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the variability of the UV luminosity function (UVLF) at $z > 5$ using the SPICE suite of cosmological, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, which include three distinct supernova (SN) feedback models: bursty-sn, smooth-sn, and hyper-sn. The bursty-sn model, driven by intense and episodic SN explosions, produces the highest fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR). Conversely, the smooth-sn model, characterized by gentler SN feedback, results in minimal SFR variability. The hyper-sn model, featuring a more realistic prescription that incorporates hypernova (HN) explosions, exhibits intermediate variability, closely aligning with the smooth-sn trend at lower redshifts. These fluctuations in SFR significantly affect the $\rm{M_{UV} - M_{halo}}$ relation, a proxy for UVLF variability. Among the models, bursty-sn produces the highest UVLF variability, with a maximum value of 2.5. In contrast, the smooth-sn and hyper-sn models show substantially lower variability, with maximum values of 1.3 and 1.5, respectively. However, in all cases, UVLF variability strongly correlates with host halo mass, with lower-mass halos showing greater variability due to more effective SN feedback in their shallower gravitational wells. The bursty-sn model, though, results in higher amplitudes. Variability decreases in lower mass haloes with decreasing redshift for all feedback models. This study underscores the critical role of SN feedback in shaping the UVLF, and highlights the mass and redshift dependence of its variability, suggesting that UVLF variability may alleviate the bright galaxy tension observed by JWST at high redshifts.
