 - **Abstract**
 The general theory of relativity is currently established as the most precise theory of gravity supported by observations, and its application is diverse ranging from astronomy to cosmology, while its application to astrophysics has been restricted only to compact stars due to the assumption that the Newtonian approximation is sufficient for celestial bodies with medium density such as the sun. Surprisingly, the recent research of the author has implied that this long-held assumption is not valid, and that non-perturbative effects significantly change relevant results obtained by Newtonian gravity. In particular, local physical quantities inside the sun are newly predicted to exhibit power law differently from the so-called standard solar model. This surprising result is reviewed including brief discussion of physics behind the discrepancy and a new application of the new mass formula to gas planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Data sizes for next generation radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), are far above that of their predecessors. The CLEAN algorithm was originally developed by Högbom [1974], long before such data sizes were thought possible and is still the most popular tool used for deconvolution in interferometric imaging. In order to facilitate these new large data sizes and reduce computation time a distributed approach to the algorithm has been investigated. The serial nature of the CLEAN algorithm, due to its matching pursuit design, makes this challenging. Splitting the image into a number of tiles which can be individually deconvolved has been investigated, but this creates discontinuities in the deconvolved image and makes it difficult to deconvolve faint sources in the presence of a point spread function associated with bright sources in other tiles. A method of feedback between each of the tiles has been developed to deal with these problems. This new approach has been tested on a simulated dataset containing multiple point sources of known intensity. When compared to a standard Högbom deconvolution the tiled feedback version produced a reconstructed image, containing sources up to 2.1 Jy, which agreed to between -0.1 Jy and +0.04 Jy of the standard method across the whole deconvolved image at a speed up to 10.66 times faster.

 - **Abstract**
 Debris disks, which consist of dust, planetesimals, planets, and gas, offer a unique window into the mineralogical composition of their parent bodies, especially during the critical phase of terrestrial planet formation spanning 10 to a few hundred million years. Observations from the $\textit{Spitzer}$ Space Telescope have unveiled thousands of debris disks, yet systematic studies remain scarce, let alone those with unsupervised clustering techniques. This study introduces $\texttt{CLUES}$ (CLustering UnsupErvised with Sequencer), a novel, non-parametric, fully-interpretable machine-learning spectral analysis tool designed to analyze and classify the spectral data of debris disks. $\texttt{CLUES}$ combines multiple unsupervised clustering methods with multi-scale distance measures to discern new groupings and trends, offering insights into compositional diversity and geophysical processes within these disks. Our analysis allows us to explore a vast parameter space in debris disk mineralogy and also offers broader applications in fields such as protoplanetary disks and solar system objects. This paper details the methodology, implementation, and initial results of $\texttt{CLUES}$, setting the stage for more detailed follow-up studies focusing on debris disk mineralogy and demographics.

          Line detections in photospheric radius expansion bursts from 4U 1820-303

 - **Abstract**
 Context: NICER (Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR) is the instrument of choice for the spectral analysis of type I X-ray bursts, as it provides high throughput at X-ray CCD resolution, down to 0.3 keV. Aims: This study investigates whether the energies of absorption lines detected in photospheric radius expansion (PRE) bursts correlate with the inferred blackbody radius. Previous reports suggested such a correlation, attributed to a combination of weaker gravitational redshift and higher blueshifts in bursts with larger radii. Methods: The analysis reexamines four previously studied PRE bursts and examines eight additional bursts from 4U 1820-303, evidencing PRE. Spectral evolution is tracked on the shortest possible timescales (tenth of a second) adopting two parallel continuum descriptions to characterise the photospheric expansion and line evolution. Applying the accretion-enhanced model, maximum blackbody radii of up to $\sim$ 900 km are inferred, with peak bolometric luminosities exceeding the Eddington limit of an Helium accretor. Absorption lines are assessed for significance using Monte Carlo simulations, and spectral lines are characterised using the state-of-art plasma codes available within {\sc{spex}} with a phenomenological continuum. A thorough parameter search explores Doppler shifts to avoid local minima. Results: Several significant (> 99.9%) absorption lines, including the previously reported 2.97 keV line, are detected. While no consistent correlation between line energies and blackbody radii is confirmed, bursts with larger radii exhibit up to four lines and the line strength is higher. The modelling suggests that the observed lines mostly originate from slightly redshifted (almost rest-frame) photo-/collisionally ionised gas in emission. For the burst with the largest PRE, a combination of photo-ionised plasma in both emission and absorption is preferred.

 - **Abstract**
 Continuous gravitational waves (CWs) emission from neutron stars carries information about their internal structure and equation of state, and it can provide tests of General Relativity. We present a search for CWs from a set of 45 known pulsars in the first part of the fourth LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observing run, known as O4a. We conducted a targeted search for each pulsar using three independent analysis methods considering the single-harmonic and the dual-harmonic emission models. We find no evidence of a CW signal in O4a data for both models and set upper limits on the signal amplitude and on the ellipticity, which quantifies the asymmetry in the neutron star mass distribution. For the single-harmonic emission model, 29 targets have the upper limit on the amplitude below the theoretical spin-down limit. The lowest upper limit on the amplitude is $6.4\!\times\!10^{-27}$ for the young energetic pulsar J0537-6910, while the lowest constraint on the ellipticity is $8.8\!\times\!10^{-9}$ for the bright nearby millisecond pulsar J0437-4715. Additionally, for a subset of 16 targets we performed a narrowband search that is more robust regarding the emission model, with no evidence of a signal. We also found no evidence of non-standard polarizations as predicted by the Brans-Dicke theory.

 - **Abstract**
 We present ORACLE, the first hierarchical deep-learning model for real-time, context-aware classification of transient and variable astrophysical phenomena. ORACLE is a recurrent neural network with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and has been trained using a custom hierarchical cross-entropy loss function to provide high-confidence classifications along an observationally-driven taxonomy with as little as a single photometric observation. Contextual information for each object, including host galaxy photometric redshift, offset, ellipticity and brightness, is concatenated to the light curve embedding and used to make a final prediction. Training on $\sim$0.5M events from the Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge, we achieve a top-level (Transient vs Variable) macro-averaged precision of 0.96 using only 1 day of photometric observations after the first detection in addition to contextual information, for each event; this increases to $>$0.99 once 64 days of the light curve has been obtained, and 0.83 at 1024 days after first detection for 19-way classification (including supernova sub-types, active galactic nuclei, variable stars, microlensing events, and kilonovae). We also compare ORACLE with other state-of-the-art classifiers and report comparable performance for the 19-way classification task, in addition to delivering accurate top-level classifications much earlier. The code and model weights used in this work are publicly available at our associated GitHub repository (this https URL).

          TOI-421 b: A Hot Sub-Neptune with a Haze-Free, Low Mean Molecular Weight Atmosphere

 - **Abstract**
 Common features of sub-Neptunes atmospheres observed to date include signatures of aerosols at moderate equilibrium temperatures (~500-800 K), and a prevalence of high mean molecular weight atmospheres, perhaps indicating novel classes of planets such as water worlds. Here we present a 0.83-5 micron JWST transmission spectrum of the sub-Neptune TOI-421 b. This planet is unique among previously observed counterparts in its high equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq} \approx 920$) and its Sun-like host star. We find marked differences between the atmosphere of TOI-421 b and those of sub-Neptunes previously characterized with JWST, which all orbit M stars. Specifically, water features in the NIRISS/SOSS bandpass indicate a low mean molecular weight atmosphere consistent with solar metallicity, and no appreciable aerosol coverage. Hints of SO$_2$ and CO (but not CO$_2$ or CH$_4$) also exist in our NIRSpec/G395M observations, but not at sufficient signal-to-noise to draw firm conclusions. Our results support a picture in which sub-Neptunes hotter than ~850 K do not form hydrocarbon hazes due to a lack of methane to photolyze. TOI-421 b additionally fits the paradigm of the radius valley for planets orbiting FGK stars being sculpted by mass loss processes, which would leave behind primordial atmospheres overlying rock/iron interiors. Further observations of TOI-421 b and similar hot sub-Neptunes will confirm whether haze-free atmospheres and low mean molecular weights are universal characteristics of such objects.

          Gravitational Turbulence: the Small-Scale Limit of the Cold-Dark-Matter Power Spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 The matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, is one of the fundamental quantities in the study of large-scale structure in cosmology. Here, we study its small-scale asymptotic limit, and show that for cold dark matter in $d$ spatial dimensions, $P(k)$ has a universal $k^{-d}$ asymptotic scaling with the wave-number $k$, for $k \gg k_{\rm nl}$, where $k_{\rm nl}^{-1}$ denotes the length scale at which non-linearities in gravitational interactions become important. We propose a theoretical explanation for this scaling, based on a non-perturbative analysis of the system's phase-space structure. Gravitational collapse is shown to drive a turbulent phase-space flow of the quadratic Casimir invariant, where the linear and non-linear time scales are balanced, and this balance dictates the $k$ dependence of the power spectrum. A parallel is drawn to Batchelor turbulence in hydrodynamics, where large scales mix smaller ones via tidal interactions. The $k^{-d}$ scaling is also derived by expressing $P(k)$ as a phase-space integral in the framework of kinetic field theory, which is analysed by the saddle-point method; the dominant critical points of this integral are precisely those where the time scales are balanced. The coldness of the dark-matter distribution function -- its non-vanishing only on a $d$-dimensional sub-manifold of phase-space -- underpins both approaches. The theory is accompanied by $1\mathrm{D}$ Vlasov--Poisson simulations, which confirm it.

 - **Abstract**
 Binospec is a wide-field optical (360 to 1000 nm) spectrograph commissioned at the MMT 6.5m telescope in 2017. In direct imaging mode Binospec addresses twin 8$^\prime$ (wide) by 15$^\prime$ (slit length) fields of view. We describe an optical fiber based integral field unit (IFU) that remaps a 12$^{\prime\prime}$ x 16$^{\prime\prime}$ contiguous region onto two pseudo slits, one in each Binospec channel. The IFU, commissioned in 2023, fits into the space of a standard slit mask frame and can be deployed as desired in a mixed program of slit masks, long slits, and IFU observations. The IFU fibers are illuminated by a hexagonal lenslet array with a 0.6$^{\prime\prime}$ pitch. A separate bundle of sky fibers consists of close-packed bare fibers arranged within an 11.8$^{\prime\prime}$ circular aperture. The 640 IFU fibers and 80 sky fibers have a core diameter of 150$\mu$m, corresponding to 0.90$^{\prime\prime}$. Three gratings are available, 270lpm with R$\sim$2000, 600lpm with R$\sim$5300, and 1000 lpm with R$\sim$6000.

          SN 2018is: a low-luminosity Type IIP supernova with narrow hydrogen emission lines at early phases

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic study of the Type IIP SN 2018is. The $V$-band luminosity and the expansion velocity at 50 days post-explosion are $-$15.1$\pm$0.2 mag (corrected for A$_V$=1.34 mag) and 1400 km s$^{-1}$, classifying it as a low-luminosity SN II. The recombination phase in the $V$-band is shorter, lasting around 110 days, and exhibits a steeper decline (1.0 mag per 100 days) compared to most other low-luminosity SNe II. Additionally, the optical and near-infrared spectra display hydrogen emission lines that are strikingly narrow, even for this class. The Fe II and Sc II line velocities are at the lower end of the typical range for low-luminosity SNe II. Semi-analytical modelling of the bolometric light curve suggests an ejecta mass of $\sim$8 M$_\odot$, corresponding to a pre-supernova mass of $\sim$9.5 M$_\odot$, and an explosion energy of $\sim$0.40 $\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg. Hydrodynamical modelling further indicates that the progenitor had a zero-age main sequence mass of 9 M$_\odot$, coupled with a low explosion energy of 0.19 $\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg. The nebular spectrum reveals weak [O I] $\lambda\lambda$6300,6364 lines, consistent with a moderate-mass progenitor, while features typical of Fe core-collapse events, such as He I, [C I], and [Fe I], are indiscernible. However, the redder colours and low ratio of Ni to Fe abundance do not support an electron-capture scenario either. As a low-luminosity SN II with an atypically steep decline during the photospheric phase and remarkably narrow emission lines, SN 2018is contributes to the diversity observed within this population.

          Compton Scattering of Thermal Disk Radiation with Black Hole Disk Winds

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic black hole (BH) X-ray binaries are known to exhibit episodic outbursts, during which accretion and spectral mode distinctively transition between low/hard and high/soft state. X-ray observations during high/soft state occasionally reveal a pronounced presence of a powerful disk wind in these systems. However, it is unexplored to date how such winds may influence disk emission in that regime. In this work, we consider an observational implication by Compton scattering of thermal disk radiation due to accretion disk winds by performing multi-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations in the context of a stratified wind of large solid angle launched over a large radial extent of the disk. Compton-scattered thermal disk spectrum is computed for a different wind property; i.e. wind density and its radial gradient. We find that the intrinsic disk radiation can be significantly down-scattered by winds of moderate-to-high density to the extent that the transmitted spectrum can substantially deviate from the conventional multi-color-disk emission by factor of up to 70\%. We thus claim that the conventional treatment of spectral hardening in the disk atmosphere may be insufficient to fully account for the observed disk continuum in the presence of strong wind scattering. It is suggested that the effect of scattering process (by $f_w$) should be incorporated to accurately evaluate an intrinsic disk spectrum besides the conventional hardening (color correction) factor (by $f_c$). We argue that BH spin measurements using thermal continuum-fitting in transient XRBs may well be mildly (if not significantly) altered by such spectral ``contamination".

 - **Abstract**
 The enduring technique of aperture masking interferometry, now more than 150 years old, is still widely practised today for it opens a window of high angular resolution astronomy that remains difficult to access by any competing technology. However, the requirement to apodise the pupil into a non-redundant array dramatically limits the throughput, typically to $\sim$10\% or less. This in turn has a dramatic impact on sensitivity, limiting observational reach to only bright science targets. This paper presents "Jewel Optics", a novel technology that leverages the gains in signal fidelity conferred by non-redundant Fizeau beam combination without the sensitivity penalty incurred by traditional aperture masks. Our approach fragments the pupil into several sets of sparse-array non-redundant patterns, each of which is encoded onto a unique phase wedge. After extensive searching, solutions could be found where all individual sets are fully non-redundant while fully tiling the available area of the input pupil. Each pattern is assigned a common phase wedge which diverts light from those sub-apertures onto a unique, defined region of the detector. We demonstrate a prototype designed for use in the VAMPIRES instrument at the Subaru telescope and find excellent agreement between the design and lab results. We discuss a design refinement for producing fully achromatic Jewel Optics, and finally we highlight the potential for future work with these novel optical components.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries from time-domain surveys are defying our expectations for how matter accretes onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The increased rate of short-timescale, repetitive events around SMBHs, including the newly-discovered quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), are garnering further interest in stellar-mass companions around SMBHs and the progenitors to mHz frequency gravitational wave events. Here we report the discovery of a highly significant mHz Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) in an actively accreting SMBH, 1ES 1927+654, which underwent a major optical, UV, and X-ray outburst beginning in 2018. The QPO was first detected in 2022 with a roughly 18-minute period, corresponding to coherent motion on scales of less than 10 gravitational radii, much closer to the SMBH than typical QPEs. The period decreased to 7.1 minutes over two years with a decelerating period evolution ($\ddot{P} > 0$). This evolution has never been seen in SMBH QPOs or high-frequency QPOs in stellar mass black holes. Models invoking orbital decay of a stellar-mass companion struggle to explain the period evolution without stable mass transfer to offset angular momentum losses, while the lack of a direct analog to stellar mass black hole QPOs means that many instability models cannot explain all of the observed properties of the QPO in 1ES 1927+654. Future X-ray monitoring will test these models, and if it is a stellar-mass orbiter, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should detect its low-frequency gravitational wave emission.

 - **Abstract**
 For the first time, we develop a simulation-based model for the Minkowski functionals (MFs) of large-scale structure, which allows us to extract the full information available from the MFs (including both the Gaussian and non-Gaussian part), and apply it to the BOSS DR12 CMASS galaxy sample. Our model is based on high-fidelity mock galaxy catalogs constructed from the \textsc{Abacus}\textsc{Summit} simulations using the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework, which include the redshift-space distortions and Alcock-Paczynski distortions, incorporate survey realism, including survey geometry and veto masks, and account for angular plus radial selection effects. The cosmological and HOD parameter dependence of the MFs is captured with a neural network emulator trained from the galaxy mocks with various cosmological and HOD parameters. To benchmark the constraining power of the MFs, we also train an emulator for the galaxy 2-point correlation function (2PCF) using the same pipeline. Having validated our approach through successful parameter recovery tests on both internal and external mocks, including non-HOD forward models of the halo-galaxy connection, we apply our forward model to analyze the CMASS data in the redshift range $0.45<z<0.58$. We find the MFs provide stronger constraints on the cosmological parameters than the 2PCF. The combination of the two gives $\omega_{\rm cdm}=0.1172^{+0.0020}_{-0.0023}$, $\sigma_8=0.783\pm 0.026$, and $n_s=0.966^{+0.019}_{-0.015}$, which are tighter by a factor of 2.0, 1.9, and 1.6 than the 2PCF alone. The derived constraint $f\sigma_8=0.453 \pm 0.016$ is also improved by a factor of 1.9, compared to the 2PCF, and agrees well with Planck 2018 predictions and other results from a series of studies in the literature.

 The Pierre Auger Observatory concluded its first phase of data taking after seventeen years of operation. The dataset collected by its surface and fluorescence detectors (FD and SD) provides us with the most precise estimates of the energy spectrum and mass composition of ultra-high energy cosmic rays yet available. We present measurements of the depth of shower maximum, the main quantity used to derive species of primary particles, determined either from the direct observation of longitudinal profiles of showers by the FD, or indirectly through the analysis of signals in the SD stations. The energy spectrum of primaries is also determined from both FD and SD measurements, where the former exhibits lower systematic uncertainty in the energy determination while the latter exploits unprecedentedly large exposure. The data for primaries with energy below 1 EeV are also available thanks to the high-elevation telescopes of FD and the denser array of SD, making measurements possible down to 6 PeV and 60 PeV, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical Cepheids are a cornerstone class of pulsators, fundamental to testing stellar evolution and pulsation theories. Their secular period changes, characterized through $O-C$ (Observed minus Calculated) diagrams, offer valuable insights into their evolution. While evolutionary period changes are well understood from both observational and theoretical perspectives, shorter timescale period changes (on the order of ($\sim$ 10$^{2}$-10$^{4}$ days) - known as non-evolutionary period changes are yet to be systematically explored. In this work, we present a detailed and comprehensive search for non-evolutionary period changes using $O-C$ analysis of Magellanic Cloud (MC) Cepheids, based on 20+ years of OGLE photometry data. Our sample includes both the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) Cepheids, focusing on single radial mode Cepheids (both fundamental (FU) and first overtone (FO) modes). The results are grouped into two phenomena: (a) Cepheids in binary systems (b) Non-linear period changes.

 - **Abstract**
 The carbon isotope ratio ($^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$) is a potential tracer of giant planet and brown dwarf formation. The GQ Lup system, hosting the K7 T Tauri star GQ Lup A and its substellar companion GQ Lup B, offers a unique opportunity to investigate this ratio in a young system. We aim to characterise the atmosphere of GQ Lup B, determining its temperature, chemical composition, spin, surface gravity, and $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$, while also measuring the same ratio for its host star, GQ Lup A. High-resolution K-band spectra of GQ Lup were obtained using CRIRES+ at the VLT. We modelled the starlight contribution from GQ Lup A and fitted GQ Lup Bś spectrum with atmospheric models from petitRADTRANS. The $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$ ratio for GQ Lup A was derived using isotope-sensitive PHOENIX models. Atmospheric analysis of GQ Lup B revealed abundances of H$_2$O, $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, HF, Na, Ca, and Ti, along with a C/O ratio of $0.50 \pm 0.01$, consistent with the solar value. The carbon isotope ratio was measured as $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C} = 53^{+7}_{-6}$ for GQ Lup B and $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C} = 51^{+10}_{-8}$ for GQ Lup A. Strong veiling of the photospheric lines of GQ Lup A was identified and accounted for. The similar $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$ values in GQ Lup A and B suggest a common origin from a shared material reservoir, supporting formation via disc fragmentation or gravitational collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-messenger astronomy is key today to broaden our understanding of the high energy Universe. When an ultra-high energy (UHE) particle interacts in the atmosphere or underground, it initiates an extensive air shower that produces a coherent radio emission in the 50-200 MHz range. The GRAND project is an envisioned observatory of UHE particles (cosmic rays, gamma rays and especially neutrinos) that will consist of 200,000 radio antennas deployed over 20 different locations each of $\sim$ 10,000 $\rm km^2$. In its current phase, it consists of 3 prototypes running autonomously in 3 different locations: GRAND@Auger in Argentina, GRAND@Nançay in France and GRANDProto300 in China, all at commissioning stage. The first goal of these pathfinders is to demonstrate the viability of the GRAND detection concept. GRANDProto300 will also propose a rich science case, by allowing the study of the transition between galactic and extra-galactic cosmic ray sources. In the following, we present the detection concept, the preliminary designs and layout and the ongoing developments of the experiment.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts are known to display various features on top of their canonical behavior. In this short review, we will describe and discuss two of them: the ultra-long gamma-ray bursts, which are defined by an extreme duration of their prompt phase, and the plateau phase, which is defined by a steady phase of large duration at the start of the afterglow. We will review the main properties of those two phenomena, and will discuss their possible origin, in light of the standard fireball model of gamma-ray bursts. A final section will discuss the future missions which could bring new evidences to the study of those objects.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of pulsar glitch phenomena serves as a valuable probe into the dynamic properties of matter under extreme high-density conditions, offering insights into the physics within neutron stars. Providing theoretical explanations for the diverse manifestations observed in different pulsars has proven to be a formidable challenge. By analyzing the distribution of glitch sizes and waiting times, along with the evolution of cumulative glitch sizes over time, we have uncovered a long-term clustering phenomenon for pulsar glitches. This perspective allows us to approach the distinct glitch representations in various pulsars from a unified standpoint, connecting the same periodicity of observational data to the randomness. Without relying on specific physical models, we utilized the coefficient of variation to numerically determine optimal clustering numbers and clustering periods for sample pulsars. Our analysis involving 27 pulsars has revealed a clear linear relationship between the glitch cluster period and characteristic age. Of interest, the cumulative distribution of functions of cluster sizes and interval times have the same patterns, which can be synchronously fitted by Gaussian processes. These results may indicate novel understandings of glitches and the resulting processes.

 - **Abstract**
 We observed an optical afterglow of GRB 200131A obtaining the first photometric point 63 s after the satellite trigger. This early observation shows a steep decay, suggesting either internal engine activity or a reverse shock. By fitting this data set, we show that the early data fit well as a reverse shock component of the GRB afterglow modeled as a thin shell expanding into a constant density interstellar matter. The fitting also shows a good agreement with a catalogued Milky Way galactic extinction and leaves only little space for further extinction in the host galaxy. By judging several factors we conclude that the most likely redshift of this GRB is 0.9 +/- 0.1.

 - **Abstract**
 Conventional general relativity supplies the notion of a vacuum tension and thus a maximum force $F_{max}=c^4/4G\approx\ 3\times 10^{43}$ Newtons, that is realized for a black hole. In conjunction with the Wilson area rule, we are thus led to the surface confinement of the mass of a black hole analogous to the surface confinement of quarks. The central result of our paper is that PeV scale protons exist on the surface of a Kerr black hole residing at our galactic center that is in concert with the HAWC Collaboration result of a PeVatron at the galactic center.

          Observations of the Ultraviolet-bright Star III-60 in the Globular Cluster NGC 6723

 - **Abstract**
 We have analyzed archival far-ultraviolet spectra of the UV-bright star III-60 in the globular cluster NGC 6723 obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) and the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS). We find that the star's photospheric parameters (effective temperature $T_{\rm eff} = 44{,}800 \pm 1200$, surface gravity $\log g = 4.89 \pm 0.18$, and helium abundance $\log N({\rm He})/N({\rm H}) = -0.84 \pm 0.29$) are consistent with the values derived from its optical spectrum, suggesting that optically-derived values are generally accurate for evolved stars with $T_{\rm eff} \lesssim$ 50,000 K. Relative to the cluster's RGB stars, III-60 is enhanced in nitrogen and depleted in carbon and oxygen. The star exhibits strong P Cygni profiles in both components of the N V $\lambda 1240$ doublet, but the resonance lines of other species show no evidence of a stellar wind. The star's effective temperature and luminosity place it on the evolutionary tracks of stars evolving from the blue horizontal branch, but its high mass ($\sim 1.2 \, M_{\odot}$) indicates that it is the product of a stellar merger. Its helium, carbon, and nitrogen abundances suggest that it is following an evolutionary path similar to that of the low-carbon, intermediate helium-rich hot subdwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 Direct imaging of exoplanets is crucial for advancing our understanding of planetary systems beyond our solar system, but it faces significant challenges due to the high contrast between host stars and their planets. Wavefront aberrations introduce speckles in the telescope science images, which are patterns of diffracted starlight that can mimic the appearance of planets, complicating the detection of faint exoplanet signals. Traditional post-processing methods, operating primarily in the image intensity domain, do not integrate wavefront sensing data. These data, measured mainly for adaptive optics corrections, have been overlooked as a potential resource for post-processing, partly due to the challenge of the evolving nature of wavefront aberrations. In this paper, we present a differentiable rendering approach that leverages these wavefront sensing data to improve exoplanet detection. Our differentiable renderer models wave-based light propagation through a coronagraphic telescope system, allowing gradient-based optimization to significantly improve starlight subtraction and increase sensitivity to faint exoplanets. Simulation experiments based on the James Webb Space Telescope configuration demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving substantial improvements in contrast and planet detection limits. Our results showcase how the computational advancements enabled by differentiable rendering can revitalize previously underexploited wavefront data, opening new avenues for enhancing exoplanet imaging and characterization.

          Identification of the interstellar 1-cyano propargyl radical (HCCCHCN) in TMC-1

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection in interstellar medium of the 1-cyano propargyl radical, HC$_3$HCN. This species is an isomer of the 3-cyano propargyl radical (CH$_2$C$_3$N), which was recently discovered in TMC-1. The 1-cyano propargyl radical was observed in the cold dark cloud TMC-1 using data from the ongoing QUIJOTE line survey, which is being carried out with the Yebes 40m telescope. A total of seven rotational transitions with multiple hyperfine components were detected in the 31.0-50.4 GHz range. We derived a column density of (2.2$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a rotational temperature of 7$\pm$1\,K. The abundance ratio between HC$_3$HCN and CH$_2$C$_3$N is 1.4. The almost equal abundance of these isomers indicates that the two species may be produced in the same reaction with a similar efficiency, probably in the reaction C + CH$_2$CHCN and perhaps also in the reaction C$_2$ + CH$_3$CN and the dissociative recombination with electrons of CH$_2$C$_3$NH$^+$

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of long-term time series photometry on RX J2133.7+5107 (also known as 1RXS J213344.1+510725) obtained at several observatories. Using data taken during 17 years, we determined the current value of the spin period of $570.811470$ seconds with the formal accuracy of $0.000006$ seconds and a spin-up of the white dwarf with a characteristic time of $1.483(1)\times10^5$ years. This is even faster than that reported previously and, if confirmed, makes this object have one of the fastest spin-up timescales of all known intermediate polars. We derived an improved value of the superhump period of the system to be $0^d.280130(1)$. Superhump maxima timings are moving on the phase curve from season to season, showing non-monotonic changes, without a change in superhump period.
