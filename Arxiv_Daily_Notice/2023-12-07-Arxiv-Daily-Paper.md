 - **Abstract**
 The theory of how low mass stars form from the collapse of a dense molecular cloud core has been well-established for decades. Thanks to significant progress in computing and numerical modelling, more physical models have been developed and a wider parameter space explored to understand the early stages of star formation more fully. In this review, I describe the expected physical properties of the first and second core stages and how the inclusion of different physics affects those predicted characteristics. I provide an overview of chemical models and synthetic observations, looking towards the positive identification of the first core in nature, which remains elusive. However, there are a few likely candidate first cores, which are listed, and I briefly discuss the recent progress in characterising the youngest protostellar sources. Chemistry will be instrumental in the firm identification of the first core so we require robust theoretical predictions of the chemical evolution of protostellar cores, especially of the first and second core outflows. Looking ahead, simulations can shed light on how the protostellar collapse phase shapes the evolution of the protostellar disc. Simulations of dust evolution during protostellar core collapse show there is significant enhancement in grain size and abundance towards the centre of the core. Chemical models show that the warm, dense conditions of the first core drive chemical evolution. There is a wide scope for further study of the role that the first and second core stages play in determining the structure and composition of the protostellar disc and envelope and, of course, the eventual influence on the formation of planets.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the X-ray spectral and spatial evolution of the Symbiotic star R Aqr. Through a multi-epoch observational campaign performed with Chandra between 2017 and 2022, we study the X-ray emission of this binary system, composed of an evolved red giant star and a white dwarf (WD). This analysis is particularly timely as the WD approached the periastron in late 2018/early 2019, thus mass transfer, jet emission and outburst phenomena are to be expected. Through detailed spectral analysis, we detect a significant rise in the soft X-ray (0.5-2 keV) emission of R Aqr, likely linked to jet emission, followed by a decay towards the previous quiescent state. The hard X-ray emission (5-8 keV), is not immediately affected by the periastron passage; the hard component, after maintaining the same flux level between 2017 and 2021, rapidly decays after 2022. Possible explanations for this are a change in the reflection properties of the medium surrounding the binary, obscuration of the central region by material ejected during the periastron passage, or even the partial/complete destruction of the inner regions of the accretion disc surrounding the WD. In addition to this activity in the central region, extended emission is also detected, likely linked to a hot spot in a pre-outburst-emitted jet, which can be observed moving away from the system's central region.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar-timing collaborations have recently reported evidence for the detection of an isotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background consistent with one sourced by a population of inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries. However, a certain degree of anisotropy and polarization may be present. Thus, the characterization of the energy density and polarization of the background at different angular scales is important. In this paper, we describe the signatures of linear polarization in the stochastic gravitational-wave background on the timing residuals obtained with pulsar-timing arrays. We expand the linear polarization map in terms of spin-weighted spherical harmonics and recast it into the $E$-mode (parity even) and $B$-mode (parity odd) basis. We provide expressions for the minimum-variance estimators for the coefficients of that expansion and evaluate the smallest detectable signal as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio with which the isotropic GW signal is detected and the number of pulsars in the survey. We evaluate the covariance between the estimators for the spherical-harmonic coefficients of the linear polarization $E$-modes and those for the intensity anisotropy. We also show that there is no covariance between the spherical-harmonic coefficients for the $B$-modes of the linear polarization and those for the circular polarization, even though both have the same parity. Our approach results in simple, elegant, and easily evaluated expressions for the overlap reduction functions for linear polarization.
#### A robust method for filling in masked data in astronomical images

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomical images often have regions with missing or unwanted information, such as bad pixels, bad columns, cosmic rays, masked objects, or residuals from imperfect model subtractions. In certain situations it can be essential, or preferable, to fill in these regions. Most existing methods use low order interpolations for this task. In this paper a method is described that uses the full information that is contained in the pixels just outside masked regions. These edge pixels are extrapolated inwards, using iterative median filtering. This leads to a smoothly varying spatial resolution within the filled-in regions, and ensures seamless transitions between masked pixels and good pixels. Gaps in continuous, narrow features can be reconstructed with high fidelity, even if they are large. The method is implemented in maskfill, an open-source MIT licensed Python script. Its performance is illustrated with several examples.
#### A Triple Scenario for the Formation of Wide Black Hole Binaries Such As  Gaia BH1

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, several non-interacting black hole-stellar binaries have been identified in Gaia data. For example, Gaia BH1, where a Sun-like star is in moderate eccentricity (e=0.45), 185-day orbit around a black hole. This orbit is difficult to explain through binary evolution. The present-day separation suggests the progenitor system would have undergone an episode of common envelope evolution, but a common envelope should shrink the period below the observed one. Since the majority of massive stars form in higher multiplicity systems, a triple evolution scenario is more likely for the progenitors of BH binaries. Here we show that such systems can indeed be more easily explained via evolution in hierarchical triple systems. von Zeipel--Lidov--Kozai oscillations or instabilities can delay the onset of the common envelope phase in the inner binary of the triple, so that the black hole progenitor and low-mass star are more widely separated when it begins, leading to the formation of wider binaries. There are also systems with similar periods but larger eccentricities, where the BH progenitor is a merger product of the inner binary in the triple. Such mergers lead to a more top-heavy black hole mass function.

 - **Abstract**
 In the canonical tachyonic resonance preheating scenario, only an order one fraction of energy density in the inflaton is transferred to radiation, due to backreaction effects. One possible way to improve the energy transfer efficiency is to allow for the perturbative decays of the resonantly produced daughter particles, which serve as the "spillway" to drain the direct decay products from inflaton and to reduce the backreaction. In this article, we study two observational consequences of spillway preheating. The first is on the inflationary observables: the scalar spectrum tilt $n_s$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. The spillway scenario modifies the evolution of the equation of state between the end of inflation and the thermal big bang. As a result, it affects the time elapsed from inflation to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), as well as the fits of inflationary models and their corresponding prediction for $n_s$ and $r$. We map out the equation of state by systematically scanning the parameter space of the spillway scenario, and show that the most efficient spillway scenario predicts a bluer spectrum, compared to the tachyonic preheating scenario. Another consequence is the production of high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). Comparing the simulation results with those of tachyonic preheating, we find that the existence of spillways leads to sharper-peaked GW spectra with a mildly damped amplitude.
#### Monitoring the X-ray Variability of Bright X-ray Sources in M33

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new five-epoch Chandra X-ray Observatory monitoring survey of the nearby spiral galaxy M33 which probes X-ray variability with time sampling between two weeks and four months. We characterize the X-ray variability of 55 bright point sources outside of the nucleus, many of which are expected to be high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). We detect eight new candidate transients not detected in previous X-ray catalogs of M33 and discuss their possible nature. The final catalog includes 26 known HMXB candidates identified in the literature. We extend the baseline of the X-ray light curves up to 21 years by including archival X-ray observations of these sources. We compare the detection and non-detection epochs of the sources to suites of simulated source duty cycles and infer that most of our detected sources have duty cycles > 30%. We find only four sources whose detection patterns are consistent with having duty cycles below 30%. This large fraction of sources with high duty cycles is unexpected for a population of HMXBs, thus more frequent X-ray monitoring will likely reveal many more low duty cycle HMXBs in M33.
#### Analysis of the 3.2-3.3 $μ$m Interstellar Absorption Feature on Three  Milky Way Sightlines

 - **Abstract**
 We report new analyses of spectra of the $3.2-3.3~\mu$m absorption feature observed in the diffuse interstellar medium toward three Milky Way sources: 2MASS $J17470898-2829561$ (2M1747) and the Quintuplet Cluster, both located in the Galactic center, and Cygnus OB2-12. The $3.2-3.3~\mu$m interval coincides with the CH-stretching region for compact polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We focus on the 2M1747 spectrum. Its published optical depth spectrum contains residual telluric transmission features, which arise from the 0.06 difference in mean airmasses between the observations of the source and its telluric standard star. We corrected the published spectrum by adding the airmass residual optical depth spectrum. The corrected spectrum is well fit by a superposition of four Gaussians. The absorption spectra of the other two sources were also fit by four Gaussians, with similar central wavelengths, widths, and relative peak opacities. We associate the three longer wavelength Gaussians covering the $3.23-3.31~\mu$m interval with compact PAHs in positive, neutral, and negative charge states. We identify the shortest wavelength Gaussian, near 3.21 $\mu$m, with irregularly-shaped PAHs. Constraints imposed by spectral smoothness on the corrected 2M1747 spectrum, augmented by a PAH cluster formation model for post-asymptotic giant branch stars, suggests that $> 99$\%\ of the PAHs in the diffuse interstellar medium reside in small clusters. This study supports the PAH hypothesis, and suggests that a family of primarily compact PAHs with a C$_{66}$H$_{20}$ (circumvalene) parent is consistent with the observed mid-infrared and ultraviolet interstellar absorption spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 The Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism in stellar-mass black hole (BH) hyperaccretion systems is generally considered to power gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Based on observational GRB data, we use the BZ mechanism driven by the BH hyperaccretion disc to investigate the evolution of the BH mass and spin after the jets break out from the progenitors. We find that the BH growths are almost independent of initial BH masses. Meanwhile, the BH growths will be more efficient with smaller initial spin parameters. We conclude that (i) the BZ mechanism is efficient for triggering BH growths for only 1 of 206 typical long-duration GRBs; (ii) the mean BH mass growths of ultra-long GRBs are marginal for all 7 samples collected; (iii) for the short-duration GRBs, the results that BHs show minimal growths is consistent with the mass supply limitation in the scenario of compact object mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 Thick, fully depleted charge-coupled devices (CCDs) are known to exhibit non-linear behavior at high signal levels due to the dynamic behavior of charges collecting in the potential wells of pixels, called the brighter-fatter effect (BFE). This particularly impacts bright calibration stars, which appear larger than their intrinsic shape, creating a flux-dependent point-spread function (PSF) that if left unmitigated, could make up a large fraction of the error budget in Stage IV weak-lensing (WL) surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). In this paper, we analyze image measurements of flat fields and artificial stars taken at different illumination levels with the LSST Camera (LSSTCam) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in order to quantify this effect in the LSST Camera before and after a previously introduced correction technique. We observe that the BFE evolves anisotropically as a function of flux due to higher-order BFEs, which violates the fundamental assumption of this correction method. We then introduce a new sampling method based on a physically motivated model to account these higher-order terms in the correction, and then we test the modified correction on both datasets. We find that the new method corrects the effect in flat fields better than it corrects the effect in artificial stars which we conclude is the result of a unmodeled curl component of the deflection field by the correction. We use these results to define a new metric for the full-well capacity of our sensors and advise image processing strategies to further limit the impact of the effect on LSST WL science pathways.
#### X-ray Observations of the Enigmatic Wolf-Rayet System Theta Mus: Two's  Company But Three's a Crowd

 - **Abstract**
 Theta Mus is a remarkable spectroscopic binary (SB) consisting of a carbon-type Wolf-Rayet star and OV companion (WC6+O6-7V) in a 19-day orbit. In addition an O-supergiant is visually detected at a small offset of 46 mas and if gravitationally bound to the SB system would have an orbital period of many decades. Theta Mus is X-ray bright and a nonthermal radio source as commonly observed in massive colliding wind (CW) binaries. We present new Chandra X-ray observations of Theta Mus which complement previous XMM-Newton observations. The X-ray emission consists of a cool nearly steady weakly-absorbed plasma component with broad redshifted emission lines located in an extended region far from the SB system. Hotter plasma is also present traced by Fe XXV emission. The observed flux in the 2-5 keV range dropped significantly on a timescale of less than 5 years. The flux decrease can be attributed to an increase in absorption toward the hotter plasma which is likely located in the confined wind interaction region of the short-period SB system. The X-ray emission of Theta Mus is remarkably similar to the WC+O binary gamma^2 Vel including carbon recombination spectral lines but both systems show unusual line centroid properties that challenge CW models.
#### Probing cosmic isotropy in the Local Universe

 - **Abstract**
 This is a model-independent analysis that investigates the statistical isotropy in the Local Universe using the ALFALFA survey data ($0 < z < 0.06$). We investigate the angular distribution of HI extra-galactic sources from the ALFALFA catalogue and study whether they are compatible with the statistical isotropy hypothesis using the two-point angular correlation function (2PACF). Aware that the Local Universe is plenty of clustered structures and large voids, we compute the 2PACF with the Landy-Szalay estimator performing directional analyses to inspect 10 sky regions. We investigate these 2PACF using power-law best-fit analyses, and determine the statistical significance of the best-fit parameters for the 10 ALFALFA regions by comparison with the ones obtained through the same procedure applied to a set of mock catalogues produced under the homogeneity and isotropy hypotheses. Our conclusion is that the Local Universe, as mapped by the HI sources of the ALFALFA survey, is in agreement with the hypothesis of statistical isotropy within $2\,\sigma$ confidence level, for small and large angle analyses, with the only exception of one region --located near the Dipole Repeller-- which appears slightly outlier ($2.4\,\sigma$). Interestingly, regarding the large angular distribution of the HI sources, we found 3 regions where the presence of cosmic voids reported in the literature left their signature in our 2PACF, suggesting projected large underdensities there, with number-density contrast $\delta \simeq -0.7$. According to the current literature these regions correspond, partially, to the sky position of the void structures known as Local Cosmic Void and Dipole Repeller.
#### On the methodological shortcomings in the Wide Binary Gravity test of  Banik et al. 2024

 - **Abstract**
 Over this last year we have published four independent refereed studies confirming the presence of a gravitational anomaly, from studying the relative velocities and separations on the plane of the sky, $v_{2D}$ and $s_{2D}$ respectively, of wide binary stars observed by the {\it Gaia} satellite. These studies show results which are fully consistent with Newtonian dynamics in a high acceleration $s_{2D}<2000$ au regime, but which conclusively identify MOND phenomenology for the low acceleration $s_{2D}>2000$ au regime. These four studies span a range of sample selection strategies and cover also a range of statistical techniques, in all cases, results are consistent in identifying a change in the effective value of the gravitational constant in the low acceleration $s_{2D}>2000$ au regime of $G \to \gamma G$ with $\gamma=1.5 \pm \sigma_{\gamma}$, with $0.06<\sigma_{\gamma}<0.2$, depending on the sample selection strategy and the statistical modelling implemented. Recently, a contradictory study appeared, Banik et al. (2024) (originally arXiv:2311.03436 in 2023), claiming a 19$\sigma$ statistical preference of a purely Newtonian model over a MOND alternative, looking also at distributions of $v_{2D}$ and $s_{2D}$ for wide binaries from the {\it Gaia} satellite, although only in the $s_{2D}>2000$ au regime. Inspection of said study readily shows the use of a statistical treatment inconsistent with the error structure of the data used. Related to the above, the best fit posterior physical parameters found in Banik et al. (2024), show a lack of correlation with their inferred gravity index. In this brief comment we expand upon the above to show that the results of Banik et al. (2024) are not due to the physics of the problem being treated, but to the methodological problems of that study.
#### NuSTAR observation of the Vela pulsar and its nebula

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of 200-ks NuSTAR observation of the Vela pulsar and the pulsar wind nebula (PWN). The phase-resolved spectra corresponding to the two main peaks in the folded pulse profile differ significantly. The spectrum of Peak 1 is significantly harder than that of Peak 2 in qualitative agreement with the earlier RXTE results. However, for both spectra, the best-fit values of photon indices for the power-law (PL) fit are noticeably larger than the previously reported values. The hardest (Peak 1) spectrum has a photon index of $1.10\pm0.15$ which is close to those measured for the bright inner jets of the PWN. We used the off-pulse interval to isolate pulsar emission and measure the compact pulsar wind nebula (PWN) spectrum in hard X-rays. We also measured the spectrum from the south-western (SW) region of the PWN which is resolved by NuSTAR from the compact PWN. For both regions, we fit the NuSTAR spectra by themselves and together with the Chandra X-ray Observatory spectra. We found that the compact PWN spectrum requires a more complex model than a simple PL with evidence for exponential cutoff in 50-80 keV. We do not find such evidence for the spectrum extracted from the SW PWN region, located farther from the pulsar, implying the energies over 600 TeV for the pulsar wind particles. This may indicate in-situ particle acceleration in that region.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the solar system abundances of several proton-rich isotopes, especially $^{92,94}$Mo and $^{96,98}$Ru, has been an enduring mystery in nuclear astrophysics. An attractive proposal to solve this problem is the $\nu p$-process, which can operate in neutrino-driven outflows in a core-collapse supernova after the shock is launched. Years of detailed studies, however, have cast doubt over the ability of this process to generate sufficiently high absolute and relative amounts of various $p$-nuclei. The $\nu p$-process is also thought to be excluded by arguments based on the long-lived radionuclide $^{92}$Nb. Here, we present explicit calculations, in which both the abundance ratios and the absolute yields of the $p$-nuclei up to $A\lesssim105$ are successfully reproduced, even when using the modern (medium enhanced) triple-$\alpha$ reaction rates. The process is also shown to produce the necessary amounts of $^{92}$Nb. The models are characterized by subsonic outflows and by the protoneutron star masses in the {$\gtrsim1.7 M_\odot$ range}. This suggests that the Mo and Ru $p$-nuclides observed in the Solar System were made in CCSN explosions characterized by an extended accretion stage.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars approaching supermassive black holes can be tidally disrupted. Despite being expected to emit X-rays, TDEs have been largely observed in optical bands, which is poorly understood. In this Letter, we simulate the tidal disruption of a $1~M_\odot$ main sequence star on an eccentric ($e=0.95$) orbit with a periapsis distance one or five times smaller than the tidal radius ($\beta = 1$ or $5$) using general relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics. We follow the simulation for up to a year post-disruption. We show that accretion disks in eccentric TDEs are masked by unbound material outflowing at $\sim10,000~$km/s. Assuming electron scattering opacity, this material would be visible as a $\sim100~$au photosphere at $\sim10^4~$K, in line with observations of candidate TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new hydrodynamic scheme named Godunov Density-Independent Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (GDISPH), that can accurately handle shock waves and contact discontinuities without any manually tuned parameters. This is in contrast to the standard formulation of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SSPH), which requires the parameters for an artificial viscosity term to handle the shocks and struggles to accurately handle the contact discontinuities due to unphysical repulsive forces, resulting in surface tension that disrupts pressure equilibrium and suppresses fluid instabilities. While Godunov SPH (GSPH) can handle the shocks without the parameters by using solutions from a Riemann solver, it still cannot fully handle the contact discontinuities. Density-Independent Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (DISPH), one of several schemes proposed to handle contact discontinuities more effectively than SSPH, demonstrates superior performance in our tests involving strong shocks and contact discontinuities. However, DISPH still requires the artificial viscosity term. We integrate the Riemann solver into DISPH in several ways, yielding some patterns of GDISPH. The results of standard tests such as the one-dimensional Riemann problem, pressure equilibrium, Sedov-Taylor, and Kelvin-Helmholtz tests are favourable to GDISPH Case 1 and GDISPH Case 2, as well as DISPH. We conclude that GDISPH Case 1 has an advantage over GDISPH Case 2, effectively handling shocks and contact discontinuities without the need for specific parameters or kernels and without introducing any additional numerical diffusion.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of our search for nearby planetary companions of transiting hot Jupiters in 12 planetary systems: HAT-P-24, HAT-P-39, HAT-P-42, HAT-P-50, KELT-2, KELT-15, KELT-17, WASP-23, WASP-63, WASP-76, WASP-79, and WASP-161. Our analysis was based on multi-sector time-series photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and precise transit timing data sets. We detected no additional transiting planets down to the 2-4 Earth radii regime. For ten hot Jupiters, no departure from linear transit ephemerides was observed. Whilst we refute long-term variations of the orbital period for WASP-161 b, which were claimed in the literature, we notice a tentative hint of the orbital period shortening for WASP-79 b. In addition, we spot a short-period transit timing variation for KELT-2A b with the characteristics typical of the so-called exomoon corridor. We conclude, however, that further observations are required to confirm these findings.

 During the first four all-sky surveys eRASS:4 carried out from December 2019 to 2021, the extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (Spektr-RG, SRG) observed the Galactic HII region Carina nebula. We analysed the eRASS:4 data to study the distribution and the spectral properties of the hot interstellar plasma and the bright stellar sources in the Carina nebula. Spectral extraction regions of the diffuse emission were defined based on X-ray spectral morphology and multi-wavelength data. The spectra were fit with a combination of thermal and non-thermal emission models. X-ray bright point sources in the Carina nebula are the colliding wind binary $\eta$ Car, several O stars, and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. We extracted the spectrum of the brightest stellar sources, which can be well fit with a multi-component thermal plasma model. The spectra of the diffuse emission in the brighter parts of the Carina nebula is well reproduced by two thermal models, a lower-temperature component ($\sim$0.2 keV) and a higher-temperature component (0.6 - 0.8 keV). An additional non-thermal component dominates the emission above $\sim$1 keV in the central region around $\eta$ Car and the other massive stars. Significant orbital variation of the X-ray flux was measured for $\eta$ Car, WR22 and WR25. $\eta$ Car requires an additional time-variable thermal component in the spectral model, which is associated to the wind-wind-collision zone. Properties like temperature, pressure, and luminosity of the X-ray emitting plasma in the Carina nebula derived from the eROSITA data are consistent with theoretical calculations of emission from superbubbles. It confirms that the X-ray emission is caused by the hot plasma inside the Carina nebula which has been shocked-heated by the stellar winds of the massive stars, in particular, of $\eta$ Car.

 - **Abstract**
 Aiming at improving the survey efficiency of the Wide Field Survey Telescope, we have developed a basic scheduling strategy that takes into account the telescope characteristics, observing conditions, and weather conditions at the Lenghu site. The sky area is divided into rectangular regions, referred to as `tiles', with a size of 2.577 deg * 2.634 deg slightly smaller than the focal area of the mosaic CCDs. These tiles are continuously filled in annulars parallel to the equator. The brightness of the sky background, which varies with the moon phase and distance from the moon, plays a significant role in determining the accessible survey fields. Approximately 50 connected tiles are grouped into one block for observation. To optimize the survey schedule, we perform simulations by taking into account the length of exposures, data readout, telescope slewing, and all relevant observing conditions. We utilize the Greedy Algorithm for scheduling optimization. Additionally, we propose a dedicated dithering pattern to cover the gaps between CCDs and the four corners of the mosaic CCD array, which are located outside of the 3 deg field of view. This dithering pattern helps to achieve relatively uniform exposure maps for the final survey outputs.

 - **Abstract**
 This thesis summarises my scientific works in the field of thermo-chemical modelling of planet-forming discs since 2009, in particular the development of the Protoplanetary Disc Model (ProDiMo). By combining chemical rate networks with continuum & line radiative transfer, and the calculation of all relevant dust and gas heating & cooling rates in an axisymmetric disc structure, these models make detailed predictions about the molecular composition of the disc, the discs' internal gas and dust temperature structure, and the composition of ice layers which form on the refractory dust grain surfaces. The development of ProDiMo was a process that took about 15 years. I have started the ProDiMo project and am the main developer, but without the involvement of an international team of scientists, in particular Inga Kamp, Wing-Fai Thi and Christian Rab, ProDiMo would not have its capabilities and would not be at the level of international recognition that is has achieved to date. Using formal solutions of the line & continuum radiative transfer, we can predict the spectral appearance of these discs from optical to millimetre wavelengths, for example the continuum and line fluxes, monochromatic images, radial intensity profiles, high-resolution line profiles that probe the disc dynamics, visibilities and channel maps. A large part of this thesis describes the publications that compared these predictions to disc observations that have been obtained by various space-borne and ground-based astronomical instruments, in particular Herschel/PACS, Spitzer/IRS, VLT/CRIRES, JWST/MIRI and ALMA. These observations probe the gas and the dust in different radial disc regions and in different layers above the midplane. This thesis summarises the conclusions drawn from the ProDiMo thermo-chemical disc models about the chemical and physical state of protoplanetary discs as the birth places of exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 The dusty winds of cool evolved stars are a major contributor of the newly synthesised material enriching the Galaxy and future generations of stars. However, the details of the physics and chemistry behind dust formation and wind launching have yet to be pinpointed. Recent spatially resolved observations show the importance of gaining a more comprehensive view of the circumstellar chemistry, but a comparative study of the intricate interplay between chemistry and physics is still difficult because observational details such as frequencies and angular resolutions are rarely comparable. Aiming to overcome these deficiencies, ATOMIUM is an ALMA Large Programme to study the physics and chemistry of the circumstellar envelopes of a diverse set of oxygen-rich evolved stars under homogeneous observing conditions at three angular resolutions between ~0.02"-1.4". Here we summarize the molecular inventory of these sources, and the correlations between stellar parameters and molecular content. Seventeen oxygen-rich or S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and red supergiant (RSG) stars have been observed in several tunings with ALMA Band 6, targeting a range of molecules to probe the circumstellar envelope and especially the chemistry of dust formation close to the star. We systematically assigned the molecular carriers of the spectral lines and measured their spectroscopic parameters and the angular extent of the emission of each line from integrated intensity maps. Across the ATOMIUM sample, we detect 291 transitions of 24 different molecules and their isotopologues. This includes several first detections in oxygen-rich AGB/RSG stars: PO v=1, SO2 v1=1 and v2=2, and several high energy H2O transitions. We also find several first detections in S-type AGB stars: vibrationally excited HCN v2=2,3 and SiS v=4,5,6, as well as first detections of the molecules SiC, AlCl, and AlF in W Aql...

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel method for measuring the lags of (weak) variability components in neutron-star and black-hole low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). For this we assume that the power and cross spectra of these sources consists of a number of components that are coherent in different energy bands, but are incoherent with one another. The technique is based on fitting simultaneously the power spectrum (PS) and the Real and Imaginary parts of the cross spectrum (CS) with a combination of Lorentzian functions. We show that, because the PS of LMXBs is insensitive to signals with a large Imaginary part and a small Real part in the CS, this approach allows us to uncover new variability components that are only detected in the CS. We also demonstrate that, contrary to earlier claims, the frequency of the type-C quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the black-hole binary GRS 1915+105 does not depend on energy. Rather, the apparent energy dependence of the QPO frequency can be explained by the presence of a separate QPO component with a slightly higher frequency than that of the QPO, whose rms amplitude increases faster with energy than the rms amplitude of the QPO. From all the above we conclude that, as in the case of the PS, the CS of black-hole and neutron-star binaries can be fitted by a combination of Lorentzian components. Our findings provide evidence that the frequency-dependent part of the transfer function of these systems can be described by a combination of responses, each of them acting over relatively well-defined time scales. This conclusion challenges models that assume that the main contribution to the lags comes from a global, broadband, transfer function of the accreting system.

 The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations carried out in 2018 April at 1.3 mm wavelengths included 9 stations in the array, comprising 7 single-dish telescopes and 2 phased arrays. The metadata package for the 2018 EHT observing campaign contains calibration tables required for the a-priori amplitude calibration of the 2018 April visibility data. This memo is the official documentation accompanying the release of the 2018 EHT metadata package, providing an overview of the contents of the package. We describe how telescope sensitivities, gain curves and other relevant parameters for each station in the EHT array were collected, processed, and validated to produce the calibration tables.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents the first HI results extracted from the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS) $-$ a narrow strip ($b \sim 3^\circ$) along the southern Milky Way. The primary goal consisted in tracing the Great Attractor (GA) Wall across the innermost Zone of Avoidance. We reduced a segment spanning the longitude range $302^\circ \leq \ell \leq 332^\circ$ for the redshift range $z \leq 0.08$. The superb SMGPS sensitivity (rms = 0.3-0.5 mJy beam$^{-1}$ per 44 kms$^{-1}$ channel) and angular resolution ($\sim$ 31" $\times$ 26") lead to a detection limit of log$(M_{\rm HI}/$M$_\odot) \geq$ 8.5 at the GA distance ($V_{\rm hel} \sim 3500 - 6500$ kms$^{-1}$). A total of 477 galaxy candidates were identified over the full redshift range. A comparison of the few HI detections with counterparts in the literature (mostly HIZOA) found the HI fluxes and other HI parameters to be highly consistent. The continuation of the GA Wall is confirmed through a prominent overdensity of $N = 214$ detections in the GA distance range. At higher latitudes, the wall moves to higher redshifts, supportive of a possible link with the Ophiuchus cluster located behind the Galactic Bulge. This deep interferometric HI survey demonstrates the power of the SMGPS in improving our insight of large-scale structures at these extremely low latitudes, despite the high obscuration and continuum background.

 We present and discuss the results of the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) HI 21-cm line mapping for five isolated low-mass (M_bary ~(2--8)*10^7 Mo) eXtremely Metal Poor (XMP) dwarfs [12+log(O/H)=7.13-7.28], selected from the Nearby Void Galaxy (NVG) sample. All the studied void dwarfs show the disturbed morphology in the HI maps with the angular resolutions of ~11" to ~40". We examine the HI morphology and velocity field and the relative orientation of their stellar and gas body spins. We discuss the overall non-equilibrium state of their gas and the possible origin and evolution of the studied void dwarfs. The most straightforward interpretation of the ubiquitous phenomenon of the gas component non-equilibrium state in these and similar void dwarfs is the cold accretion from the void filaments and/or minor mergers. The cold gas accretion in voids could be linked to the presence of small filaments that constitute the substructure of voids.

 - **Abstract**
 Using integral field spectroscopy from MaNGA, we study the resolved microstructures in a shocked region in Criss Cross Nebula (CCN), with an unprecedentedly high resolution of $\lesssim$1000 AU. We measure surface brightness maps for 34 emission lines, which can be broadly divided into three categories: (1) the [OIII] $\lambda$5007-like group including seven high-ionization lines and two [OII] auroral lines which uniformly present a remarkable lane structure, (2) the H$\alpha$ $\lambda$6563-like group including 23 low-ionization or recombination lines which present a clump-like structure, and (3) [OII] $\lambda$3726 and [OII] $\lambda$3729 showing high densities at both the [OIII] $\lambda$5007 lane and the H$\alpha$ clump. We use these measurements to constrain resolved shock models implemented in MAPPINGS V. We find our data can be reasonably well-fitted by a model which includes a plane-parallel shock with a velocity of $133\pm5$ km/s, plus an isotropic two-dimensional Gaussian component which is likely another clump of gas ionized by photons from the shocked region, and a constant background. We compare the electron density and temperature profiles as predicted by our model with those calculated using observed emission line ratios. We find different line ratios to provide inconsistent temperature maps, and the discrepancies can be attributed to observational effects caused by limited spatial resolution and projection of the shock geometry, as well as contamination of the additional Gaussian component. Implications on shock properties and perspectives on future IFS-based studies of CCN are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 A complete accounting of nearby objects -- from the highest-mass white dwarf progenitors down to low-mass brown dwarfs -- is now possible, thanks to an almost complete set of trigonometric parallax determinations from Gaia, ground-based surveys, and Spitzer follow-up. We create a census of objects within a Sun-centered sphere of 20-pc radius and check published literature to decompose each binary or higher-order system into its separate components. The result is a volume-limited census of $\sim$3,600 individual star formation products useful in measuring the initial mass function across the stellar ($<8 M_\odot$) and substellar ($\gtrsim 5 M_{Jup}$) regimes. Comparing our resulting initial mass function to previous measurements shows good agreement above 0.8$M_\odot$ and a divergence at lower masses. Our 20-pc space densities are best fit with a quadripartite power law, $\xi(M) = dN/dM \propto M^{-\alpha}$ with long-established values of $\alpha = 2.3$ at high masses ($0.55 < M < 8.00 M_\odot$) and $\alpha = 1.3$ at intermediate masses ($0.22 < M < 0.55 M_\odot$), but at lower masses we find $\alpha = 0.25$ for $0.05 < M <0.22 M_\odot$ and $\alpha = 0.6$ for $0.01 < M < 0.05 M_\odot$. This implies that the rate of production as a function of decreasing mass diminishes in the low-mass star/high-mass brown dwarf regime before increasing again in the low-mass brown dwarf regime. Correcting for completeness, we find a star to brown dwarf number ratio of, currently, 4:1, and an average mass per object of 0.41 $M_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel machine-learning approach for detecting faint point sources in high-contrast adaptive optics imaging datasets. The most widely used algorithms for primary subtraction aim to decouple bright stellar speckle noise from planetary signatures by subtracting an approximation of the temporally evolving stellar noise from each frame in an imaging sequence. Our approach aims to improve the stellar noise approximation and increase the planet detection sensitivity by leveraging deep learning in a novel direct imaging post-processing algorithm. We show that a convolutional autoencoder neural network, trained on an extensive reference library of real imaging sequences, accurately reconstructs the stellar speckle noise at the location of a potential planet signal. This tool is used in a post-processing algorithm we call Direct Exoplanet Detection with Convolutional Image Reconstruction, or ConStruct. The reliability and sensitivity of ConStruct are assessed using real Keck/NIRC2 angular differential imaging datasets. Of the 30 unique point sources we examine, ConStruct yields a higher S/N than traditional PCA-based processing for 67$\%$ of the cases and improves the relative contrast by up to a factor of 2.6. This work demonstrates the value and potential of deep learning to take advantage of a diverse reference library of point spread function realizations to improve direct imaging post-processing. ConStruct and its future improvements may be particularly useful as tools for post-processing high-contrast images from the James Webb Space Telescope and extreme adaptive optics instruments, both for the current generation and those being designed for the upcoming 30 meter-class telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations with radio arrays that target the 21-cm signal originating from the early Universe suffer from a variety of systematic effects. An important class of these are reflections and spurious couplings between antennas. We apply a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler to the modelling and mitigation of these systematics in simulated Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (HERA) data. This method allows us to form statistical uncertainty estimates for both our models and the recovered visibilities, which is an important ingredient in establishing robust upper limits on the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) power spectrum. In cases where the noise is large compared to the EoR signal, this approach can constrain the systematics well enough to mitigate them down to the noise level for both systematics studied. Where the noise is smaller than the EoR, our modelling can mitigate the majority of the reflections with there being only a minor level of residual systematics, while cross-coupling sees essentially complete mitigation. Our approach performs similarly to existing filtering/fitting techniques used in the HERA pipeline, but with the added benefit of rigorously propagating uncertainties. In all cases it does not significantly attenuate the underlying signal.
