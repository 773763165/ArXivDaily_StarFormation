 - **Abstract**
 The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration has recently released measurements of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) from the first year of observations. A joint analysis of DESI BAO, CMB, and SN Ia probes indicates a preference for time-evolving dark energy. We evaluate the robustness of this preference by replacing the DESI distance measurements at $z<0.8$ with the SDSS BAO measurements in a similar redshift range. Assuming the $w_0w_a$CDM model, we find an evolution of the dark energy equation of state parameters consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. Our analysis of $\chi^2$ statistics across various BAO datasets shows that DESI's preference for evolving dark energy is primarily driven by the two LRG samples at $z_{\rm eff}=0.51$ and $z_{\rm eff}=0.71$, with the latter having the most significant impact. Taking this preference seriously, we study a general Horndeski scalar-tensor theory, which provides a physical mechanism to safely cross the phantom divide, $w=-1$. Utilizing the Effective Field Theory of dark energy and adopting the $w_0w_a$CDM background cosmological model, we derive constraints on the parameters $w_0=-0.856\pm0.062$ and $w_a=-0.53_{-0.26}^{+0.28}$ at $68\%$ CL from Planck CMB, Planck and ACT CMB lensing, DESI BAO, and Pantheon+ datasets, showing good consistency with the standard $w_0w_a$CDM model. The modified gravity model shows a preference over $\Lambda$CDM at the $2.4\sigma$ level, while for $w_0w_a$CDM it is at $2.5\sigma$. We conclude that modified gravity offers a viable physical explanation for DESI's preference for evolving dark energy.

          Probing Dust and Gas Properties Using Ringed Disks

 - **Abstract**
 How rapidly a planet grows in mass and how far they may park from the host star depend sensitively on two non-dimensional parameters: Stokes number St and turbulent $\alpha$. Yet, these parameters remain highly uncertain being difficult or impossible to measure directly. Here, we demonstrate how the ringed disks can be leveraged to obtain St and $\alpha$ separately by constructing a simple toy model that combines dust radial equation of motion under aerodynamic drag and coupling to gas motion with the measured distribution of dust masses in Class 0/I disks. Focusing on known systems with well-resolved dust rings, we find that the range of St and $\alpha$ that are consistent with the measured properties of the rings are small: $10^{-4} \lesssim {\rm St} \lesssim 10^{-2}$ and $10^{-5} \lesssim \alpha \lesssim 10^{-3}$. These low St and $\alpha$ ensure the observed rings are stable against clumping. Even in one marginal case where the formation of bound clumps is possible, further mass growth by pebble accretion is inhibited. Furthermore, the derived low $\alpha$ is consistent with the nearly inviscid regime where Type I migration can be prematurely halted. Our analysis predicts minimal planet population beyond $\sim$10s of au where we observe dust rings and significantly more vigorous planet formation inside $\sim$10 AU, consistent with current exo-giant statistics. We close with discussions on the implications of our results on small planet statistics at large orbital distances.

          Adaptive Habitability of Exoplanets: Thriving Under Extreme Environmental Change

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamic nature of life's ability to thrive in diverse and changing planetary environments suggests that habitability and survival depend on the evolutionary path and life adaptation to environmental conditions. Here we explore such "adaptive habitability" through astro-ecological models. We study the interplay between temperature adaptation and environmental fluctuations, particularly those induced by solar activity and orbital dynamics. We present a simplified ecological-evolutionary model to investigate the limits of life's adaptability on a planetary scale. By incorporating complexities such as multiple niches, migration, species interactions, and realistic temperature variations, we demonstrate the potential for adaptive habitability in the face of both gradual and abrupt environmental changes. Through simulations encompassing monotonic, periodic, and secular dynamical evolution-induced temperature profiles, we identify critical thresholds for survival and extinction, highlighting the importance of phenotypic variance and dispersal rates in adapting to varying environmental conditions. These findings underscore the significance of considering temporal variations in assessing exoplanet habitability and expanding the search space for potentially habitable worlds.

          A Detailed Chemical Study of the Extreme Velocity Stars in the Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 Two decades on, the study of hypervelocity stars is still in its infancy. These stars can provide novel constraints on the total mass of the Galaxy and its Dark Matter distribution. However how these stars are accelerated to such high velocities is unclear. Various proposed production mechanisms for these stars can be distinguished using chemo-dynamic tagging. The advent of Gaia and other large surveys have provided hundreds of candidate hyper velocity objects to target for ground based high resolution follow-up observations. We conduct high resolution spectroscopic follow-up observations of 16 candidate late-type hyper velocity stars using the Apache Point Observatory and the McDonald Observatory. We derive atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances for these stars. We measure up to 22 elements, including the following nucleosynthetic families: {\alpha} (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), light/Odd-Z (Na, Al, V, Cu, Sc), Fe-peak (Fe, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn), and Neutron Capture (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Nd, Eu). Our kinematic analysis shows one candidate is unbound, two are marginally bound, and the remainder are bound to the Galaxy. Finally, for the three unbound or marginally bound stars, we perform orbit integration to locate possible globular cluster or dwarf galaxy progenitors. We do not find any likely candidate systems for these stars and conclude that the unbound stars are likely from the the stellar halo, in agreement with the chemical results. The remaining bound stars are all chemically consistent with the stellar halo as well.

          Ultrasoft state of microquasar Cygnus X-3: X-ray polarimetry reveals the geometry of astronomical puzzle

 - **Abstract**
 Cygnus X-3 is an enigmatic X-ray binary, that is both an exceptional accreting system and a cornerstone for the population synthesis studies. Prominent X-ray and radio properties follow a well-defined pattern, yet the physical reasons for the state changes observed in this system are not known. Recently, the presence of an optically thick envelope around the central source in the hard state was revealed using the X-ray polarization data obtained with Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). In this work, we analyse IXPE data obtained in the ultrasoft (radio quenched) state of the source. The average polarization degree (PD) of $11.9\pm0.5\%$ at a polarization angle (PA) of $94^{\circ}\pm1^{\circ}$ is inconsistent with the simple geometry of the accretion disc viewed at an intermediate inclination. The high PD, the blackbody-like spectrum, and the weakness of fluorescent iron line imply that the central source is hidden behind the optically thick outflow and its beamed radiation is scattered towards our line of sight. In this picture the observed PD is directly related to the source inclination, which we conservatively determine to lie in the range $26^{\circ}<i<28^{\circ}$. Using the new polarimetric properties, we propose the scenario that can be responsible for the cyclic behaviour of the state changes in the binary.

          Alcock-Paczy\'nski effect on void-finding: Implications for void-galaxy cross-correlation modelling

 - **Abstract**
 Under the assumption of statistical isotropy, and in the absence of directional selection effects, a stack of voids is expected to be spherically symmetric, which makes it an excellent object to use for an Alcock-Paczyński (AP) test. This is commonly done using the void-galaxy cross-correlation function (CCF), which has emerged as a competitive probe, especially in combination with the galaxy-galaxy auto correlation function. Current studies of the AP effect around voids assume that the void centre positions transform under the choice of fiducial cosmology in the same way as galaxy positions. We show that this assumption, though prevalent in the literature, is complicated by the response of void-finding algorithms to shifts in tracer positions. Using stretched simulation boxes to emulate the AP effect, we investigate how the void-galaxy CCF changes under AP, revealing an additional effect imprinted in the CCF that must be accounted for. The effect comes from the response of void finders to the distorted tracer field, reducing the amplitude of the AP signal in the CCF, and thus depends on the specific void finding algorithm used. We present results for four different void finding packages: $\texttt{revolver}$, $\texttt{vide}$, $\texttt{voxel}$, and the spherical void finder in the $\texttt{Pylians3}$ library, demonstrating how incorrect treatment of the AP effect results in biases in the recovered parameters for all of them. Finally, we propose a method to alleviate this issue without resorting to complex and finder-specific modelling of the void finder response to AP.

          Next Generation Very Large Array Memo #122: Characterization of the synthesized beam with and without MID antennas in Mexico

 - **Abstract**
 Synthesized beam (PSF) synthetic observations with and without the antennas in Mexico are analyzed. For a simple continuum observing setup, we generated visibility files and their associated PSF images for a grid of parameters (robust weighting, tapering, and declination). The tests were done for both the MID and MID+Spiral+Core configurations and their cropped versions without antennas in Mexico. We show that the performance of the Array, in terms of the beam properties, is in general significantly better when both the MID array antennas are present in Northern Mexico and observations target southern sources. At a declination of -40 deg, there are increments in the ellipticity of at least ~1.3X and 1.2X for a tapering of 3.0 and 4.0 mas, if the antennas in Mexico are not included. For the parameter space tested, the changes in ellipticity of the MID and MID+Spiral+Core configurations differ by ~10%. Larger tapering values help to reduce the ellipticity for cropped configurations at all declinations, but it will impose more constraints in terms of angular resolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The three-dimensional galaxy power spectrum is a powerful probe of primordial non-Gaussianity and additional general relativistic (GR) effects on large scales, which can be constrained by the current and upcoming large-scale structure surveys. In this work, we calculate the linear-order relativistic power spectrum in the spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) basis, a coordinate system that preserves the geometry of the curved sky and fully accounts for the wide-angle effect. In particular, we model the GR effects present in the discrete SFB power spectrum, which is a more efficient and stable decomposition of the galaxy density field compared to the continuous SFB basis in the presence of radial windows. To validate our GR calculations, we introduce a mapping between the angular power spectrum and the SFB power spectrum, and we compare our calculations with outputs from CLASS. We discuss the rich pattern of GR effects in the SFB basis and compare the GR effects to the local primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) effect. The Doppler and lensing effects have different angular and Fourier dependence compared to the PNG in the SFB basis, while the gravitational potential term is more degenerate with the PNG and comparable to a signal of $f_{\rm NL}\sim 1$. We also discuss the potential opportunities of extracting the lensing effect through SFB modes in upcoming LSS surveys.

          Investigation of the Gamma-Ray Bursts prompt emission under the relativistically expanding fireball scenario

 - **Abstract**
 The spectral properties of a composite thermal emission arising from a relativistic expanding fireball can be remarkably different from the Planck function. We perform a detailed study of such a system to explore the features of the prompt emission spectra from the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Particularly, we address the effect of optical opacity and its dependence on the density profile between the expanding gas and the observer. This results in a nontrivial shape of the photospheric radius which in combination with the constraints derived from the equal-arrival-time can result in a mild broader spectrum compared to the Planck function. Further, we show the time-integrated spectrum from the expanding fireball deviates significantly from the instantaneous emission and is capable of explaining the observed broad spectral width of the GRBs. We also show, that the demand of the spectral width of the order of unity, obtained through statistical analysis, is consistent with the scenario where the dynamics of the expanding fireball are governed predominantly by the energy content of the matter.

 - **Abstract**
 The spatial distribution of the gaseous components of the Milky Way is of great importance for a number of different fields, e.g. Galactic structure, star formation and cosmic rays. However, obtaining distance information to gaseous clouds in the interstellar medium from Doppler-shifted line emission is notoriously difficult given our unique vantage point in the Galaxy. It requires precise knowledge of gas velocities and generally suffers from distance ambiguities. Previous works often assumed the optically thin limit (no absorption), a fixed velocity field, and lack resolution overall. We aim to overcome these issues and improve previous reconstructions of the gaseous constituents of the interstellar medium of the Galaxy. We use 3D Gaussian processes to model correlations in the interstellar medium, including correlations between different lines of sight, and enforce a spatially coherent structure in the prior. For modelling the transport of radiation from the emitting gas to us as observers, we take absorption effects into account. A special numerical grid ensures high resolution nearby. We infer the spatial distributions of HI, CO, their emission line-widths, and the Galactic velocity field in a joint Bayesian inference. We further constrain these fields with complementary data from Galactic masers and young stellar object clusters. Our main result consists of a set of samples that implicitly contain statistical uncertainties. The resulting maps are spatially coherent and reproduce the data with high fidelity. We confirm previous findings regarding the warping and flaring of the Galactic disc. A comparison with 3D dust maps reveals a good agreement on scales larger than approximately 400 pc. While our results are not free of artefacts, they present a big step forward in obtaining high quality 3D maps of the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 The first TeV gamma-ray source with no lower energy counterparts, TeV J2032+4130, was discovered by HEGRA. It appears in the third HAWC catalog as 3HWC J2031+415 and it is a bright TeV gamma-ray source whose emission has previously been resolved as 2 sources: HAWC J2031+415 and HAWC J2030+409. While HAWC J2030+409 has since been associated with the \emph{Fermi-LAT} Cygnus Cocoon, no such association for HAWC J2031+415 has yet been found. In this work, we investigate the spectrum and energy-dependent morphology of HAWC J2031+415. We associate HAWC J2031+415 with the pulsar PSR J2032+4127 and perform a combined multi-wavelength analysis using radio, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray emission. We conclude that HAWC J2031+415 and, by extension, TeV J2032+4130 are most probably a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by PSR J2032+4127.

 - **Abstract**
 Users of astronomical observatories rely on Exposure Time Calculators (ETC) to prepare their proposals and then their observations. The ETC is therefore a crucial element in an observatory's data workflow and in particular is key to optimise the use of telescope times. This is also true for the La Silla Paranal Observatory and ESO has therefore embarked in a project to modernise its ETC, based on a python back-end and an Angular-based front-end, while also providing a programmatic interface. This ETC 2.0 has now been implemented for all the new Paranal and La Silla instruments (CRIRES, ERIS, HARPS/NIRPS, and 4MOST) and work is ongoing to implement it for MOONS. All the current ESO La Silla and Paranal instruments will also be migrated progressively, and the first one has been FORS2. The new ETC2 is based on the Instrument Packages, which should allow in the future a smooth interaction with the Phase 1 and Phase 2 observation preparation tools. Moreover, the ETC 2.0 framework has recently been upgraded and makes now use of the NgRx/Store technology in the front-end.

 - **Abstract**
 ESO is in the process of upgrading one of the two FORS (FOcal Reducer/low dispersion Spectrograph) instruments - a multi-mode (imaging, polarimetry, long-slit, and multi-object spectroscopy) optical instrument mounted on the Cassegrain focus of Unit Telescope 1 of ESO's Very Large Telescope. FORS1 was moved from Chile to Trieste, and is undergoing complete refurbishment, including the exchange of all motorised parts. In addition, new software is developed, based on the Extremely Large Telescope Instrument Control Software Framework, as the upgraded FORS1 will be the first instrument in operations to use this framework. The new Teledyne e2V CCD has now been procured and is undergoing testing with the New Generation Controller at ESO. In addition, a new set of grisms have been developed, and a new set of filters will be purchased. A new internal calibration unit has been designed, making the operations more efficient.

 To test the potential disruptive effect of Artificial Intelligence (AI) transformers (e.g., ChatGPT) and their associated Large Language Models on the time allocation process, both in proposal reviewing and grading, an experiment has been set-up at ESO for the P112 Call for Proposals. The experiment aims at raising awareness in the ESO community and build valuable knowledge by identifying what future steps ESO and other observatories might need to take to stay up to date with current technologies. We present here the results of the experiment, which may further be used to inform decision-makers regarding the use of AI in the proposal review process. We find that the ChatGPT-adjusted proposals tend to receive lower grades compared to the original proposals. Moreover, ChatGPT 3.5 can generally not be trusted in providing correct scientific references, while the most recent version makes a better, but far from perfect, job. We also studied how ChatGPT deals with assessing proposals. It does an apparent remarkable job at providing a summary of ESO proposals, although it doesn't do so good to identify weaknesses. When looking at how it evaluates proposals, however, it appears that ChatGPT systematically gives a higher mark than humans, and tends to prefer proposals written by itself.

          XMM-Newton and NuSTAR discovery of a likely IP candidate XMMU J173029.8-330920 in the Galactic Disk

 - **Abstract**
 We aim at characterizing the population of low-luminosity X-ray sources in the Galactic plane by studying their X-ray spectra and periodic signals in the light curves. We are performing an X-ray survey of the Galactic disk using XMM-Newton, and the source XMMU J173029.8-330920 was serendipitously discovered in our campaign. We performed a follow-up observation of the source using our pre-approved NuSTAR target of opportunity time. We used various phenomenological models in xspec for the X-ray spectral modeling. We also computed the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to search for X-ray periodicity. A Monte Carlo method was used to simulate 1000 artificial light curves to estimate the significance of the detected period. We also searched for X-ray, optical, and infrared counterparts of the source in various catalogs. The spectral modeling indicates the presence of an intervening cloud with $N_{\rm H}\sim(1.5-2.3)\times10^{23}\ \rm cm^{-2}$ that partially absorbs the incoming X-ray photons. The X-ray spectra are best fit by a model representing emission from a collisionally ionized diffuse gas with plasma temperature $kT=26^{+11}_{-5}$ keV. Furthermore, an Fe $K_{\alpha}$ line at $6.47^{+0.13}_{-0.06}$ keV was detected with an equivalent width of the line of $312\pm104$ eV. We discovered a coherent pulsation with a period of $521.7\pm0.8$ s. The 3-10 keV pulsed fraction of the source is around $\sim$50-60\%. The hard X-ray emission with plasma temperature $kT=26^{+11}_{-5}$ keV, iron $K_{\alpha}$ emission at 6.4 keV and a periodic behavior of $521.7\pm0.8$ s suggest XMMU J173029.8-33092 to be an intermediate polar. We estimated the mass of the central white dwarf to be $0.94-1.4\ M_{\odot}$ by assuming a distance to the source of $\sim1.4-5$ kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper offers an original theoretical framework to quantify the information content associated with cosmological structure formation. The formalism is developed and employed to study the spectrum of information underlying the galaxy distribution in the observable Universe. Using data from SDSS DR18 we further quantify the information sharing across different parts of the studied volume. An attempt to validate the assumption of cosmic homogeneity is made, which rules out the presence of a Universal scale of uniformity below $130 h^{-1}$ Mpc. In addition, an analytical study is carried out to track back the evolution of global information content up to $z=20$, where a log-normal density distribution with redshift-dependent variance, skewness, and kurtosis is used to mimic the observable Universe. A staggering $ 8 \times 10^{144} TB$ of information loss is estimated, caused by the formation of large-scale structures in the present universe. We further illustrate how the global information budget is impacted at different epochs by the interaction between the expansion rate and growth rate of structure, taking the $\Lambda CDM$ model into account. It is found that while the growth rate of the global information content is slowing down, information loss is increasing dramatically despite an ongoing accelerated expansion.

 CONTEXT: The spectral analysis of hot, massive stars is a fundamental astrophysical method to obtain their intrinsic properties and their feedback. Quantitative spectroscopy for hot, massive stars requires detailed numerical modeling of the atmosphere and an iterative treatment to obtain the best solution within a given framework. AIMS: We present an overview of different techniques for the quantitative spectroscopy of hot stars employed within the X-Shooting ULLYSES collaboration, from grid-based approaches to tailored fits. By performing a blind test, we gain an overview about the similarities and differences of the resulting parameters. Our study aims to provide an overview of the parameter spread caused by different approaches. METHODS: For three different stars from the sample (SMC O5 star AzV 377, LMC O7 star Sk -69 50, and LMC O9 star Sk -66 171), we employ different atmosphere codes (CMFGEN, Fastwind, PoWR) and strategies to determine their best-fitting model. For our analyses, UV and optical spectra are used to derive the properties with some methods relying purely on optical data for comparison. To determine the overall spectral energy distribution, we further employ additional photometry from the literature. RESULTS: Effective temperatures for each of three sample stars agree within 3 kK while the differences in log g can be up to 0.2 dex. Luminosity differences of up to 0.1 dex result from different reddening assumptions, which seem to be larger for the methods employing a genetic algorithm. All sample stars are nitrogen-enriched. CONCLUSIONS: We find a reasonable agreement between the different methods. Tailored fitting tends to be able to minimize discrepancies obtained with more course or automatized treatments. UV spectral data is essential for the determination of realistic wind parameters. For one target (Sk -69 50), we find clear indications of an evolved status.

          On the response of massive main sequence stars to mass accretion and outflow at high rates

 - **Abstract**
 With a one-dimensional stellar evolution model, we find that massive main-sequence stars can accrete mass at very high mass accretion rates without expanding much if they lose a significant fraction of this mass from their outer layers simultaneously with mass accretion. We assume the accretion process is via an accretion disk that launches powerful jets from its inner zones. These jets remove the outer high-entropy layers of the mass-accreting star. This process operates in a negative feedback cycle, as the jets remove more envelope mass when the star expands. With the one-dimensional model, we mimic the mass removal by jets by alternative mass addition and mass removal phases. For the simulated models of 30Mo and 60Mo, the star does not expand much if we remove more than about half of the added mass in not-too-short episodes. This holds even if we deposit the energy the jets do not carry into the envelope. As the star does not expand much, its gravitational potential well stays deep, and the jets are energetic. These results are relevant to bright transient events of binary systems powered by accretion and the launching of jets, e.g., intermediate luminosity optical transients, including some luminous red novae, the grazing envelope evolution, and the 1837-1856 Great Eruption of Eta Carinae.

 - **Abstract**
 A primary objective of exoplanet atmosphere characterisation is to learn about planet formation and evolution, however, this is challenged by degeneracies. To determine whether differences in atmospheric composition can be reliably traced to differences in evolution, we are undertaking a new survey with JWST to compare the compositions of a sample of hot Jupiters that orbit F stars above the Kraft break with different orbital alignments. Under the assumption that aligned planets migrate through the inner disc, while misaligned planets migrate after disc dispersal, the act of migrating through the inner disc should lead to a measurable difference in the C/O between aligned and misaligned planets. We expect the amplitude and sign of this difference to depend on the amount of planetesimal accretion and whether silicates accreted from the inner disc release their oxygen. Here, we identify all known exoplanets that are suitable for testing this hypothesis, describe our JWST survey, and use noise simulations and atmospheric retrievals to estimate our survey's sensitivity. With the selected sample of four aligned and four misaligned hot Jupiters, we will be sensitive to the predicted differences in C/O between aligned and misaligned hot Jupiters for a wide range of model scenarios.

          BOWIE-ALIGN: How formation and migration histories of giant planets impact atmospheric compositions

 - **Abstract**
 Hot Jupiters present a unique opportunity for measuring how planet formation history shapes present-day atmospheric composition. However, due to the myriad pathways influencing composition, a well-constructed sample of planets is needed to determine whether formation history can be accurately traced back from atmospheric composition. To this end, the BOWIE-ALIGN survey will compare the compositions of 8 hot Jupiters around F stars, 4 with orbits aligned with the stellar rotation axis and 4 misaligned. Using the alignment as an indicator for planets that underwent disc migration or high-eccentricity migration, one can determine whether migration history produces notable differences in composition between the two samples of planets. This paper describes the planet formation model that motivates our observing programme. Our model traces the accretion of chemical components from the gas and dust in the disc over a broad parameter space to create a full, unbiased model sample from which we can estimate the range of final atmospheric compositions. For high metallicity atmospheres (O/H > 10 times solar), the C/O ratios of aligned and misaligned planets diverge, with aligned planets having lower C/O (< 0.25) due to the accretion of oxygen-rich silicates from the inner disc. However, silicates may rain out instead of releasing their oxygen into the atmosphere. This would significantly increase the C/O of aligned planets (C/O > 0.6), inverting the trend between the aligned and misaligned planets. Nevertheless, by comparing statistically significant samples of aligned and misaligned planets, we expect atmospheric composition to constrain how planets form.

          Measuring cosmic expansion with diffractive gravitational scintillation of nanoHertz gravitational waves

 - **Abstract**
 The recent discovery of ultra-long wavelength gravitational waves through the advent of pulsar timing arrays (PTA) has opened up new avenues for fundamental science. Here we show that every PTA source will be diffractively lensed by potentially hundreds of galactic disks transverse to its line of sight, leading to modest modulations in the strain, $\Delta h / h \sim 10^{-3} \lambda^{-1}_{1 \rm pc.}$, due to wave lensing effects. The induced interference, or scintillation, pattern will be resolvable by coherent PTAs and may be leveraged, alongside fore-ground redshift information, to make precise measurements of cosmic expansion. If future PTA experiments can achieve enough signal-to-noise to detect these small modulations, hundreds of redshift-distance pairs may be inferred from the diffractive lensing of an individual PTA source.

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars are subject to accelerations in globular clusters that manifest themselves in both the first and second spin period time derivatives, and can be used to explore the mass distribution of the potentials they inhabit. Here we report on over 20 years of pulsar timing observations of five millisecond radio pulsars in the core of the core-collapse globular cluster NGC\,6752 with the Parkes (Murriyang) and MeerKAT radio telescopes, that have allowed us to measure the proper motions, positions and first and second time derivatives of the pulsars. The pulsar timing parameters indicate that all the pulsars in the core experience accelerations and jerks that can be explained only if an amount of non-luminous mass of at least $2.56\times10^3M_\odot$ is resent in the core of NGC\,6752. On the other hand, our studies highly disfavour the presence of an intermediate mass black hole at the center of the cluster, with a mass equal to or greater than $\sim3000M_\odot$.

          Direct evidence of hybrid nature of EUV waves and the reflection of the fast-mode wave

 - **Abstract**
 In current study, we perform the analysis of an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wave on 2022 March 31. The event originated from the from NOAA active region (AR) 12975 (location: N13W52) in the Atmospheric imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) satellite and exactly the west limb in Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A) observations. The EUV wave was associated with a GOES medium class i.e. M9.6 eruptive flare. The event was also well observed by MLSO and COR1 coronagraph. For the first time, we found here clear simultaneous observations of two components of EUV wave in AIA as well as in STEREO-A images, which was predicted in EUV wave hybrid model. These components are fast-mode wave and non-wave counterparts. The speed of fast-mode EUV wave in AIA 193 A is ~658$\pm$4 km/s, while the non-wave component propagates with a speed of ~157$\pm$3 km/s. The computed speed in STEREO-A 195 A for the fast-mode wave and non-wave components are ~590$\pm$3 km/s and ~150$\pm$2 km/s, respectively. The EUV wave interaction with AR shows the reflection of it above the solar limb. The speed of the reflected and transmitted wave components are 140 and 180 km/s, which is slower than the incident wave. With the precise alignments, we found the fast-mode EUV wave is just ahead of the coronal mass ejection (CME) and the non-wave component is cospatial with the core of the accompanied CME. In addition to these, the event also shows the stationary fronts and the reflection from the AR located towards the south of the EUV wave origin site.

          Aligning Planet-Hosting Binaries via Dissipative Precession in Circumstellar Disks

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have demonstrated that some subset of even moderately wide-separation planet-hosting binaries are preferentially configured such that planetary and binary orbits appear to lie within the same plane. In this work, we explore dissipation during the protoplanetary disk phase, induced by disk warping as the system is forced into nodal recession by an inclined binary companion as a possible avenue of achieving orbit-orbit alignment. We analytically model the coupled evolution of the disk angular momentum vector and stellar spin vector under the influence of a distant binary companion. We find that a population of systems with random initial orientations can appear detectably more aligned after undergoing dissipative precession, and that this process can simultaneously produce an obliquity distribution that is consistent with observations. While dissipative precession proceeds efficiently in close binaries, favorable system properties (e.g., $r_{out} \gtrsim 100$ AU, $\alpha \gtrsim 0.05$, and/or $M_b/M_{*} \gtrsim 1$) are required to reproduce observed alignment trends at wider binary separations $a_\mathrm{b} \gtrsim450$ AU. Our framework further predicts that circum-primary planets in systems with high stellar mass ratios should be preferentially less aligned than planets in equal-mass stellar binary systems. We discover tentative evidence for this trend in \textit{Gaia} DR3 and TESS data. Our findings suggest that dissipative precession may play a significant role in sculpting orbital configurations in a sub-set of moderately-wide planet-hosting binaries, but is likely not solely responsible for their observed population-level alignment.
