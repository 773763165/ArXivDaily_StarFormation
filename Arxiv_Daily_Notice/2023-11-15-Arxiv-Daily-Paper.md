 - **Abstract**
 In observational studies of infrared dark clouds, the number of detections of CO freeze-out onto dust grains (CO depletion) at pc-scale is extremely limited, and the conditions for its occurrence are, therefore, still unknown. We report a new object where pc-scale CO depletion is expected. As a part of Kagoshima Galactic Object survey with Nobeyama 45-m telescope by Mapping in Ammonia lines (KAGONMA), we have made mapping observations of NH3 inversion transition lines towards the star-forming region associated with the CMa OB1 including IRAS 07077-1026, IRAS 07081-1028, and PGCC G224.28-0.82. By comparing the spatial distributions of the NH3 (1,1) and C18O (J=1-0), an intensity anti-correlation was found in IRAS 07077-1026 and IRAS 07081-1028 on the ~1 pc scale. Furthermore, we obtained a lower abundance of C18O at least in IRAS 07077-1026 than in the other parts of the star-forming region. After examining high density gas dissipation, photodissociation, and CO depletion, we concluded that the intensity anti-correlation in IRAS 07077-1026 is due to CO depletion. On the other hand, in the vicinity of the centre of PGCC G224.28-0.82, the emission line intensities of both the NH3 (1,1) and C18O (J=1-0) were strongly detected, although the gas temperature and density were similar to IRAS 07077-1026. This indicates that there are situations where C18O (J=1-0) cannot trace dense gas on the pc scale and implies that the conditional differences that C18O (J=1-0) can and cannot trace dense gas are unclear.
#### Origin of reduced dynamical friction by dark matter halos with net  prograde rotation

 - **Abstract**
 We provide an explanation for the reduced dynamical friction on galactic bars in spinning dark matter halos. Earlier work based on linear theory predicted an increase in dynamical friction when dark halos have a net forward rotation, because prograde orbits couple to bars more strongly than retrograde orbits. Subsequent numerical studies, however, found the opposite trend: dynamical friction weakens with increasing spin of the halo. We revisit this problem and demonstrate that linear theory in fact correctly predicts a reduced torque in forward-rotating halos. We show that shifting the halo mass from retrograde to prograde phase space generates a positive gradient in the distribution function near the origin of the z-angular momentum (Lz=0), which results in a resonant transfer of Lz to the bar, making the net dynamical friction weaker. While this effect is subdominant for the major resonances, including the corotation resonance, it leads to a significant positive torque on the bar for the series of direct radial resonances, as these resonances are strongest at Lz=0. The overall dynamical friction from spinning halos is shown to decrease with the halo's spin, in agreement with the secular behavior of N-body simulations. We validate our linear calculation by computing the nonlinear torque from individual resonances using the angle-averaged Hamiltonian.
#### Mapping the core of the Tarantula Nebula with VLT-MUSE. III. A template  for metal-poor starburst regions in the visual and far-ultraviolet

 - **Abstract**
 We present the integrated VLT-MUSE spectrum of the central 2'x2' (30x30 pc$^{2}$) of NGC 2070, the dominant giant HII region of the Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud, together withan empirical far-ultraviolet spectrum constructed via LMC template stars from the ULLYSES survey and Hubble Tarantula Treasury Project UV photometry. NGC 2070 provides a unique opportunity to compare results from individual stellar populations (e.g. VLT FLAMES Tarantula Survey) in a metal-poor starburst region to the integrated results from the population synthesis tools Starburst99, Charlot & Bruzual and BPASS. The metallicity of NGC 2070 inferred from standard nebular strong line calibrations is 0.4$\pm$0.1 dex lower than obtained from direct methods. The Halpha inferred age of 4.2 Myr from Starburst99 is close to the median age of OB stars within the region, although individual stars span a broad range of 1-7 Myr. The inferred stellar mass is close to that obtained for the rich star cluster R136 within NGC 2070, although this contributes only 21% to the integrated far-UV continuum. HeII 1640 emission is dominated by classical WR stars and main sequence WNh+Of/WN stars. 18% of the NGC~2070 far UV continuum flux arises from very massive stars with >100 Msun, including several very luminous Of supergiants. None of the predicted population synthesis models at low metallicities are able to successfully reproduce the far-UV spectrum of NGC 2070. We attribute issues to the treatment of mass-loss in very massive stars, the lack of contemporary empirical metal-poor templates, plus WR stars produced via binary evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Models of Jupiter s interior struggle to agree with measurements of the atmospheric composition. Interior models favour a subsolar or solar abundance of heavy elements Z while atmospheric measurements suggest a supersolar abundance. One potential solution may be the presence of an inverted Z-gradient, namely an inward decrease of Z, which implies a larger heavy element abundance in the atmosphere than in the outer envelope. We investigate two scenarios in which the inverted Z gradient is located either where helium rain occurs (Mbar level) or at upper levels (kbar level) where a radiative region could exist. We aim to assess how plausible these scenarios are. We calculate interior and evolution models of Jupiter with such inverted Z-gradient and use constraints on the stability and the formation of an inverted Z-gradient. We find that an inverted Z-gradient at the location of helium rain cannot work as it requires a late accretion and of too much material. We find interior models with an inverted Z-gradient at upper levels, due to a radiative zone preventing downward mixing, that could satisfy the present gravity field of the planet. However, our evolution models suggest that this second scenario might not be in place. An inverted Z-gradient in Jupiter could be stable. Yet, its presence either at the Mbar level or kbar level is rather unlikely.
#### Candidates for Transiting Planets in OGLE-IV Galactic Bulge Fields

 - **Abstract**
 We present results of a search for transiting exoplanets in 10-yr long photometry with thousands of epochs taken in the direction of the Galactic bulge. This photometry was collected in the fourth phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE-IV). Our search covered approx. 222 000 stars brighter than I = 15.5 mag. Selected transits were verified using a probabilistic method. The search resulted in 99 high-probability candidates for transiting exoplanets. The estimated distances to these targets are between 0.4 kpc and 5.5 kpc, which is a significantly wider range than for previous transit searches. The planets found are Jupiter-size, with the exception of one (named OGLE-TR-1003b) located in the hot Neptune desert. If the candidate is confirmed, it can be important for studies of highly irradiated intermediate-size planets. The existing long-term, high-cadence photometry of our candidates increases the chances of detecting transit timing variations at long timescales. Selected candidates will be observed by the future NASA flagship mission, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, in its search for Galactic bulge microlensing events, which will further enhance the photometric coverage of these stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries of a super-virial hot phase of the Milky Way circumgalactic medium (CGM) has launched new questions regarding the multi-phase structure of the CGM around the Galaxy. We use 1.05 Ms of archival Chandra/HETG observations to characterize highly ionized metal absorption at z=0 along the line of sight of the quasar NGC 3783. We detect two distinct temperature phases with T$_1 = 5.83^{+0.15}_{-0.07}$ K, warm-hot virial temperature, and T$_2=6.61^{+0.12}_{-0.06}$ K, hot super-virial temperature. The super-virial hot phase coexisting with the warm-hot virial phase has been detected in absorption along only two other sightlines and in one stacking analysis. There is scatter in temperature of the hot as well as warm-hot gas. Similar to previous observations, we detect super-solar abundance ratios of metals in the hot phase, with a Ne/O ratio 2$\sigma$ above solar mixtures. These new detections continue the mystery of the mechanism behind the super-virial hot phase, but provide evidence that this is a true property of the CGM rather than an isolated observation. The super-virial CGM could hold the key to understanding the physical and chemical history of the Milky Way.
#### JWST imaging of edge-on protoplanetary disks II. Appearance of edge-on  disks with a tilted inner region: case study of IRAS04302+2247

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST imaging from 2$\mu$m to 21$\mu$m of the edge-on protoplanetary disk around the embedded young star IRAS04302+2247. The structure of the source shows two reflection nebulae separated by a dark lane. The source extent is dominated by the extended filamentary envelope at $\sim$4.4$\mu$m and shorter wavelengths, transitioning at 7$\mu$m and longer wavelengths to more compact lobes of scattered light from the disk itself. The dark lane thickness does not vary significantly with wavelength, which we interpret as an indication for intermediate-sized ($\sim10\mu$m) grains in the upper layers of the disk. Intriguingly, we find that the brightest nebula of IRAS40302 switches side between 12.8$\mu$m and 21$\mu$m. We explore the effect of a tilted inner region on the general appearance of edge-on disks. We find that radiative transfer models of a disk including a tilted inner region can reproduce an inversion in the brightest nebula. In addition, for specific orientations, the model also predicts strong lateral asymmetries, which can occur for more than half possible viewing azimuths. A large number of edge-on protoplanetary disks observed in scattered light show such lateral asymmetries (15/20), which suggests that a large fraction of protoplanetary disks might host a tilted inner region. Stellar spots may also induce lateral asymmetries, which are expected to vary over a significantly shorter timescale. Variability studies of edge-on disks would allow to test the dominant scenario for the origin of these asymmetries.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the key research themes identified by the Astro2020 decadal survey is Worlds and Suns in Context. The Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS) is a proposed NASA APEX mission that will become the prime high-energy instrument for studying star-planet connections from birth to death. This work explores the major advances in this broad domain of research that will be enabled by the AXIS mission, through X-ray observations of stars in clusters spanning a broad range of ages, flaring M-dwarf stars known to host exoplanets, and young stars exhibiting accretion interactions with their protoplanetary disks. In addition, we explore the ability of AXIS to use planetary nebulae, white dwarfs, and the Solar System to constrain important physical processes from the microscopic (e.g., charge exchange) to the macroscopic (e.g., stellar wind interactions with the surrounding interstellar medium).
#### Critique of arXiv submission 2308.15623, "Discovery of Spherules of  Likely Extrasolar Composition in the Pacific Ocean Site of the CNEOS  2014-01-08 (IM1) Bolide", by A. Loeb et al

 - **Abstract**
 Recently a manuscript by Loeb et al. was uploaded to arXiv (preprint 2308.15623) that asserted that the CNEOS bolide 2014-01-08 was interstellar; that spherules recovered from the seafloor near the airburst were associated with this bolide; that they had Fe isotopic ratios indicating origin as micrometeorites; that they had unusual chemical compositions enriched in Be, La and U, never seen before in micrometeorite spherules; that these compositions were formed in the magma ocean stage of a differentiated extrasolar planet; and that the Be abundance reflected passage through the interstellar medium. Despite not being peer-reviewed, this uploaded manuscript has been reported by media outlets as "published", and its conclusions have been widely distributed as fact. The purpose of this manuscript is to provide potential peer reviewers and the general public with an appreciation of the multiple fatal flaws with the manuscript's arguments. We discuss the published evidence that the 2014-01-08 bolide is not interstellar. We show that there is no statistical spatial correlation of a chemical signature or even number of recovered spherules with the 2014-01-08 bolide. We demonstrate that the Fe isotopic ratios decisively indicate an origin in our Solar System, with > 99.995% probability. We demonstrate that the unusual enrichments in La, U, etc., have in fact been observed in micrometeorites before and attributed to terrestrial contamination; and that the Be abundances are similarly consistent with those of ferromanganese nodules, after reacting with sea water. Far from being exotic particles from an extrasolar planet, the spherules collected and analyzed by Loeb et al. appear to be just like those found around the world, with a Solar System origin and compositions modified by tens of thousands of years residence at the ocean bottom.

 - **Abstract**
 The performance of the proposed MATHUSLA detector as an instrument for studying the physics of cosmic rays by measuring extensive air showers is presented. The MATHUSLA detector is designed to observe and study the decay of long-lived particles produced at the pp interaction point of the CMS detector at CERN during the HL-LHC data-taking period. The proposed MATHUSLA detector will be composed of many layers of long scintillating bars that cannot measure more than one hit per bar and correctly report the hit coordinate in case of multiple hits. This study shows that adding a layer of RPC detectors with both analogue and digital readout significantly enhances the capabilities of MATHUSLA to measure the local densities and arrival times of charged particles at the front of air showers. We discuss open issues in cosmic-ray physics that the proposed MATHUSLA detector with an additional layer of RPC detectors could address and conclude by comparing with other air-shower facilities that measure cosmic rays in the PeV energy range.

 - **Abstract**
 A proposed setting for thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae is a white dwarf that has gained mass from a companion to the point of carbon ignition in the core. There is a simmering phase in the early stages of burning that involves the formation and growth of a core convection zone. One aspect of this phase is the convective Urca process, a linking of weak nuclear reactions to convection that may alter the composition and structure of the white dwarf. Convective Urca is not well understood and requires 3D fluid simulations to realistically model. Additionally, the convection is relatively slow (Mach number less than 0.005) so a low-Mach method is needed to make simulating computationally feasible. Using the MAESTROeX low-Mach hydrodynamics code, we investigate recent changes to how the weak reactions are modeled in the convective Urca simulations. We present results that quantify the changes to the reaction rates and their impact on the evolution of the simulation.

 - **Abstract**
 The Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) has previously excluded Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnisky (DFSZ) axions between 680-790 MHz under the assumption that the dark matter is described by the isothermal halo model. However, the precise nature of the velocity distribution of dark matter is still unknown, and alternative models have been proposed. We report the results of a non-virialized axion search over the mass range 2.81-3.31 {\mu}eV, corresponding to the frequency range 680-800 MHz. This analysis marks the most sensitive search for non-virialized axions sensitive to Doppler effects in the Milky Way Halo to date. Accounting for frequency shifts due to the detector's motion through the Galaxy, we exclude cold flow relic axions with a velocity dispersion of order 10^-7 c with 95% confidence.
#### Characterization of the visit-to-visit Stability of the GR700XD Spectral  Traces for NIRISS/SOSS Observations

 - **Abstract**
 In this report, we present the results of our analysis of trace position changes during NIRISS/SOSS observations. We examine the visit-to-visit impact of the GR700XD pupil wheel (PW) position alignment on trace positions for spectral orders 1 and 2 using the data obtained to date. Our goal is to improve the wavelength solution by correlating the trace positions on the detector with the PW position angle. We find that there is a one-to-one correspondence between PW position and spectral trace rotation for both orders. This allowed us in turn to find an analytic model that is able to predict a trace position/shape as a function of PW position with sub-pixel accuracy of about ~0.1 pixels. Such a function can be used to predict the trace position in low signal-to-noise ratio cases, and/or as a template to track trace position changes as function of time in Time Series Observations (TSOs).
#### Characterization of the visit-to-visit Stability of the GR700XD  Wavelength Calibration for NIRISS/SOSS Observations

 - **Abstract**
 When utilizing the NIRISS/SOSS mode on JWST, the pupil wheel (tasked with orienting the GR700XD grism into the optical path) does not consistently settle into its commanded position resulting in a minor misalignment with deviations of a few fractions of a degree. These small offsets subsequently introduce noticeable changes in the trace positions of the NIRISS SOSS spectral orders between visits. This inconsistency, in turn, can lead to variations of the wavelength solution. In this report, we present the visit-to-visit characterization of the NIRISS GR700XD Wavelength Calibration for spectral orders 1 and 2. Employing data from Calibration Program 1512 (PI: Espinoza), which intentionally and randomly sampled assorted pupil wheel positions during observations of the A-star BD+60-1753, as well as data from preceding commissioning and calibration activities to model this effect, we demonstrate that the wavelength solution can fluctuate in a predictable fashion between visits by up to a few pixels. We show that via two independent polynomial regression models for spectral orders 1 and 2, respectively, using the measured x-pixel positions of known Hydrogen absorption features in the A-star spectra and pupil wheel positions as regressors, we can accurately predict the wavelength solution for a particular visit with an RMS error within a few tenths of a pixel. We incorporate these models in PASTASOSS, a Python package for predicting the GR700XD spectral traces, which now allows to accurately predict spectral trace positions and their associated wavelengths for any NIRISS/SOSS observation.
#### Grain-size measurements in protoplanetary disks indicate fragile pebbles  and low turbulence

 - **Abstract**
 Recent laboratory experiments have revealed that destructive collisions of icy dust particles may occur at much lower velocities than previously believed. These low fragmentation velocities push down the maximum grain size in collisional growth models. Motivated by the smooth radial distribution of pebble sizes inferred from ALMA/VLA multi-wavelength continuum analysis, we propose a concise model to explain this feature and aim to constrain the turbulence level at the midplane of protoplanetary disks. Our approach is built on the assumption that the fragmentation threshold is the primary barrier limiting pebble growth within pressure maxima. Consequently, the grain size at the ring location can provide direct insights into the turbulent velocity governing pebble collisions and, by extension, the turbulence level at the disk midplane. We validate this method using the Dustpy code, which simulates dust transport and coagulation. We apply our method to 7 disks, TW Hya, IM Lup, GM Aur, AS 209, HL Tau, HD 163296, and MWC 480, for which grain sizes have been measured from multi-wavelength continuum analysis. A common feature emerges from our analysis, with an overall low turbulence coefficient of $\alpha\sim10^{-4}$ observed in five out of seven disks when taking fragmentation velocity $v_{\rm frag} = 1{\rm \,m\,s}^{-1}$. A higher fragmentation velocity would imply a turbulence coefficient significantly larger than the current observational constraints. IM Lup stands out with a relatively higher coefficient of $10^{-3}$. Notably, HL Tau exhibits an increasing trend in $\alpha$ with distance, which supports enhanced turbulence at its outer disk region, possibly associated with the infalling streamer onto HL~Tau. The current (sub)mm pebble size constrained in disks implies low levels of turbulence, as well as fragile pebbles consistent with recent laboratory measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop two new highly efficient estimators to measure the polarization (Stokes parameters) in experiments that constrain the position angle of individual photons such as scattering and gas-pixel-detector polarimeters, and analyse in detail a previously proposed estimator. All three of these estimators are at least fifty percent more efficient on typical datasets than the standard estimator used in the field. We present analytic estimates of the variance of these estimators and numerical experiments to verify these estimates. Two of the three estimators can be calculated quickly and directly through summations over the measurements of individual photons.
#### The formation of blue large-amplitude pulsators from white-dwarf  main-sequence star mergers

 - **Abstract**
 Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) are hot low-mass stars which show large-amplitude light variations likely due to radial oscillations driven by iron-group opacities. Period changes provide evidence of both secular contraction and expansion amongst the class. Various formation histories have been proposed, but none are completely satisfactory. \citet{Zhang2017} proposed that the merger of a helium core white dwarf with a low-mass main-sequence star (HeWD+MS) can lead to the formation of some classes of hot subdwarf. We have analyzed these HeWD+MS merger models in more detail. Between helium-shell ignition and full helium-core burning, the models pass through the volume of luminosity -- gravity-- temperature space occupied by BLAPs. Periods of expansion and contraction associated with helium-shell flashes can account for the observed rates of period change. We argue that the HeWD+MS merger model provides at least one BLAP formation channel.

 - **Abstract**
 Hierarchical triple-star systems consists of three components organised into an inner binary ($M_{1}$,$M_{2}$) and a more distant outer tertiary ($M_{3}$) star. The LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey (LAMOST-MRS) has offered a great sample for the study of triple system populations. We used the Peak Amplitude Ratio (PAR) method to obtain the mass ratio ($q_\mathrm{{in}}$, $q_\mathrm{{out}}$) of a triple system from its normalised spectrum. By calculating Cross-Correlation Function (CCF), we determined the correlation between the mass ratio $q_\mathrm{{out}}$ ($M_{3}$/($M_{1}$+$M_{2}$)) and the amplitude ratio ($A_{3}$/($A_{1}$+$A_{2}$)). We derived $q_\mathrm{{in}}$ of $0.5-1.0$ and $q_\mathrm{{out}}$ between 0.2 and 0.8. By fitting a power-law function of the corrected $q_\mathrm{{in}}$ distribution, the $\gamma_\mathrm{{in}}$ are estimated to be $-0.654\pm2.915$, $4.304\pm1.125$ and $11.371\pm1.309$ for A, F and G type stars. The derived $\gamma_\mathrm{{in}}$-values increase as the mass decrease, indicating that less massive stars are more likely to have companion stars with similar masses. By fitting a power-law function of the corrected $q_\mathrm{{out}}$ distribution, the ${\gamma_\mathrm{{out}}}$ are estimated to be $-2.016\pm0.172$, $-1.962\pm0.853$ and $-1.238\pm0.141$ for G, F and A type stars, respectively. The ${\gamma_\mathrm{{out}}}$-values show a trend of growth toward lower primary star masses.

 - **Abstract**
 Track reconstruction algorithms are critical for polarization measurements. In addition to traditional moment-based track reconstruction approaches, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are a promising alternative. However, hexagonal grid track images in gas pixel detectors (GPD) for better anisotropy do not match the classical rectangle-based CNN, and converting the track images from hexagonal to square results in loss of information. We developed a new hexagonal CNN algorithm for track reconstruction and polarization estimation in X-ray polarimeters, which was used to extract emission angles and absorption points from photoelectron track images and predict the uncertainty of the predicted emission angles. The simulated data of PolarLight test were used to train and test the hexagonal CNN models. For individual energies, the hexagonal CNN algorithm produced 15-30% improvements in modulation factor compared to moment analysis method for 100% polarized data, and its performance was comparable to rectangle-based CNN algorithm newly developed by IXPE team, but at a much less computational cost.

 - **Abstract**
 We present radio observations of 24 confirmed and candidate strongly lensed quasars identified by the Gaia Gravitational Lenses (GraL) working group. We detect radio emission from 8 systems in 5.5 and 9 GHz observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), and 12 systems in 6 GHz observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). The resolution of our ATCA observations is insufficient to resolve the radio emission into multiple lensed images, but we do detect multiple images from 11 VLA targets. We have analysed these systems using our observations in conjunction with existing optical measurements, including measuring offsets between the radio and optical positions, for each image and building updated lens models. These observations significantly expand the existing sample of lensed radio quasars, suggest that most lensed systems are detectable at radio wavelengths with targeted observations, and demonstrate the feasibility of population studies with high resolution radio imaging.

 - **Abstract**
 Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors have been widely used as soft X-ray detectors in several fields owing to their recent developments and unique advantages. The parameters of CMOS detectors have been extensively studied and evaluated. However, the key parameter signal-to-noise ratio in certain fields has not been sufficiently studied. In this study, we analysed the charge distribution of the CMOS detector GSENSE2020BSI and proposed a two-dimensional segmentation method to discriminate signals according to the charge distribution. The effect of the two-dimensional segmentation method on the GSENSE2020BSI dectector was qualitatively evaluated. The optimal feature parameters used in the two-dimensional segmentation method was studied for G2020BSI. However, the two-dimensional segmentation method is insensitive to feature parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Helioseismology has discovered a thin layer beneath the solar surface where the rotation rate increases rapidly with depth. The normalized rotational shear in the upper 10 Mm of the layer is constant with latitude. Differential rotation theory explains such a rotational state by a radial-type anisotropy of the near-surface convection and a short correlation time of convective turbulence compared to the rotation period. The shear layer is the main driver of the global meridional circulation.
#### Study of the Blazhko type RRc stars in the Stripe 82 region using SDSS  and ZTF

 - **Abstract**
 RR Lyrae stars are pulsating stars, many of which also show a long-term variation called the Blazhko effect which is a modulation of amplitude and phase of the lightcurve. In this work, we searched for the incidence rate of the Blazhko effect in the first-overtone pulsating RR Lyrae (RRc) stars of the Galactic halo. The focus was on the Stripe 82 region in the Galactic halo which was studied by Sesar et al using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. In their work, 104 RR Lyrae stars were classified as RRc type. We combined their SDSS light curves with Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, and use them to document the Blazhko properties of these RRc stars. Our analysis showed that among the 104 RRc stars, 8 were rather RRd stars, and were excluded from the study. Out of remaining 96, 34 were Blazhko type, 62 were non-Blazhko type, giving the incidence rate of 35.42% for Blazhko RRc stars. The shortest Blazhko period found was 12.808 +/- 0.001 d for SDSS 747380, while the longest was 3100 +/- 126 d for SDSS 3585856. Combining SDSS and ZTF data sets increased the probability of detecting the small variations due to the Blazhko effect, and thus provided a unique opportunity to find longer Blazhko periods. We found that 85% of RRc stars had the Blazhko period longer than 200 d.
#### Influence of departures from LTE on determinations of the scandium  abundances in A-B type stars

 - **Abstract**
 We developed a comprehensive model atom of Sc II-Sc III. Abundances of scandium for a sample of eight unevolved A9-B3 type stars with well-determined atmospheric parameters were determined based on the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) line formation for Sc II-Sc III and high-resolution observed spectra. For the Sc II lines, the abundance differences between NLTE and LTE grow rapidly with increasing effective temperature (Teff), from slightly negative at Teff = 7250 K to positive ones of up to 0.6 dex at Teff = 10400 K. For Sc III in $\iota$ Her, NLTE reduces the line-to-line scatter substantially compared to the LTE case. The NLTE abundances of Sc in our five superficially normal stars are consistent within the error bars with the solar system Sc abundance, while the LTE abundances of the late B-type stars are greatly subsolar. NLTE reduces, but does not remove a deficiency of Sc in the Am stars HD 72660 and Sirius. Based on our own and the literature data, the Ca/Sc abundance ratios of the sample of 16 Am stars were found to be close together, with [Ca/Sc] = 0.6-0.7. We propose the Ca/Sc abundance ratio, but not abundances of individual Ca and Sc elements to be used for classifying a star as Am and for testing the diffusion models. We provide the NLTE abundance corrections for ten lines of Sc II in a grid of model atmospheres appropriate for A to late B-type stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Line observations of young stellar objects (YSOs) at (sub)millimeter wavelengths provide essential information of gas kinematics in star and planet forming environments. For Class 0 and I YSOs, identification of Keplerian rotation is of particular interest, because it reveals presence of rotationally-supported disks that are still being embedded in infalling envelopes and enables us to dynamically measure the protostellar mass. We have developed a python library SLAM (Spectral Line Analysis/Modeling) with a primary focus on analyses of emission line data at (sub)millimeter wavelengths. Here, we present an overview of the pvanalysis tool from SLAM, which is designed to identify Keplerian rotation of a disk and measure the dynamical mass of a central object using a position-velocity (PV) diagram of emission line data. The advantage of this tool is that it analyzes observational features of given data and thus requires few computational time and parameter assumptions, in contrast to detailed radiative transfer modelings. In this article, we introduce the basic concept and usage of this tool, present an application to observational data, and discuss remaining caveats.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can help probe the fundamental physics behind cosmic inflation via the measurement of primordial $B$ modes. As this requires exquisite control over instrumental systematics, some next-generation CMB experiments plan to use a rotating half-wave plate (HWP) as polarization modulator. However, the HWP non-idealities, if not properly treated in the analysis, can result in additional systematics. In this paper, we present a simple, semi-analytical end-to-end model to propagate the HWP non-idealities through the macro-steps that make up any CMB experiment (observation of multi-frequency maps, foreground cleaning, and power spectra estimation) and compute the HWP-induced bias on the estimated tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$. We find that the effective polarization efficiency of the HWP suppresses the polarization signal, leading to an underestimation of $r$. Laboratory measurements of the properties of the HWP can be used to calibrate this effect, but we show how gain calibration of the CMB temperature can also be used to partially mitigate it. On the basis of our findings, we present a set of recommendations for the HWP design that can help maximize the benefits of gain calibration.

 - **Abstract**
 We determine the ortho/para ratios of NH2D and NHD2 in two dense, starless cores, where their formation is supposed to be dominated by gas-phase reactions, which, in turn, is predicted to result in deviations from the statistical spin ratios. The Large APEX sub-Millimeter Array (LAsMA) multibeam receiver of the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope was used to observe the prestellar cores H-MM1 and Oph D in Ophiuchus in the ground-state lines of ortho and para NH2D and NHD2. The fractional abundances of these molecules were derived employing 3D radiative transfer modelling, using different assumptions about the abundance profiles as functions of density. We also ran gas-grain chemistry models with different scenarios concerning proton or deuteron exchanges and chemical desorption from grains to find out if one of these models can reproduce the observed spin ratios. The observationally deduced ortho/para ratios of NH2D and NHD2 are in both cores within 10% of their statistical values 3 and 2, respectively, and taking 3-sigma limits, deviations from these of about 20% are allowed. Of the chemistry models tested here, the model that assumes proton hop (as opposed to full scrambling) in reactions contributing to ammonia formation, and a constant efficiency of chemical desorption, comes nearest to the observed abundances and spin ratios. The nuclear spin ratios derived here are in contrast with spin-state chemistry models that assume full scrambling in proton donation and hydrogen abstraction reactions leading to deuterated ammonia. The efficiency of chemical desorption influences strongly the predicted abundances of NH3, NH2D, and NHD2, but has a lesser effect on their ortho/para ratios. For these the proton exchange scenario in the gas is decisive. We suggest that this is because of rapid re-processing of ammonia and related cations by gas-phase ion-molecule reactions.
#### Keplerian disks and outflows in binary post-AGB stars

 - **Abstract**
 There is a class of binary post-AGB stars that are surrounded by Keplerian disks and that often present outflows resulting from gas escaping from the disk. We present maps and complex models of 12CO and 13CO J=2-1 emission lines for four objects: AC Herculis, 89 Herculis, IRAS 19125+0343, and R Scuti. Our maps and models allow us to study their morphology, kinematics, and mass distribution. Our maps and modeling of AC Her reveal that 95% of the total nebular mass is located in the disk. So this source is a disk-dominated source (like the Red Rectangle, IW Carinae, IRAS 08544-4431). On the contrary, our maps and modeling of 89 Herculis, IRAS 19125+0343, and R Scuti suggest that the outflow is the dominant component of the nebula, resulting in a new subclass nebulae around binary post-AGB stars: the outflow-dominated ones. Besides CO, the molecular content of this kind of sources was barely known. We also present the first and very deep single-dish radio molecular survey in the 1.3, 2, 3, 7, and 13 mm bands. Our results allow us to classify our sources as O- or C-rich. We also conclude that these sources present in general a low molecular richness, especially those that are disk-dominated, compared to circumstellar envelopes around AGB stars and other post-AGB stars. This thesis presents a comprehensive study at millimetre wavelengths. On the one hand, we perform a detailed kinetic study of these objects through NOEMA interferometric observations and complex models. On the other hand, we study the chemistry of these sources, thanks to our sensitive single-dish observations. The union of these different methods yields a comprehensive study of the molecular gas present in these sources. Hopefully, this Ph.D. thesis will become a reference for future studies of molecular gas in nebulae around binary post-AGB stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs serve as ideal laboratories for studying the atmospheres of giant exoplanets on wide orbits as the governing physical and chemical processes in them are nearly identical. Understanding the formation of gas giant planets is challenging, often involving the endeavour to link atmospheric abundance ratios, such as the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio, to formation scenarios. However, the complexity of planet formation requires additional tracers, as the unambiguous interpretation of the measured C/O ratio is fraught with complexity. Isotope ratios, such as deuterium-to-hydrogen and 14N/15N, offer a promising avenue to gain further insight into this formation process, mirroring their utility within the solar system. For exoplanets only a handful of constraints on 12C/13C exist, pointing to the accretion of 13C-rich ice from beyond the disks' CO iceline. Here we report on the mid-infrared detection of the 14NH3 and 15NH3 isotopologues in the atmosphere of a cool brown dwarf with an effective temperature of 380 K in a spectrum taken with the Mid-InfraRed Instrument of the James Webb Space Telescope. As expected, our results reveal a 14N/15N value consistent with star-like formation by gravitational collapse, demonstrating that this ratio can be accurately constrained. Since young stars and their planets should be more strongly enriched in the 15N isotope, we expect that 15NH3 will be detectable in a number of cold, wide-separation exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 Vast amounts of astronomical photometric data are generated from various projects, requiring significant efforts to identify variable stars and other object classes. In light of this, a general, widely applicable classification framework would simplify the task of designing custom classifiers. We present a novel deep learning framework for classifying light curves using a weakly supervised object detection model. Our framework identifies the optimal windows for both light curves and power spectra automatically, and zooms in on their corresponding data. This allows for automatic feature extraction from both time and frequency domains, enabling our model to handle data across different scales and sampling intervals. We train our model on datasets obtained from both space-based and ground-based multi-band observations of variable stars and transients. We achieve an accuracy of 87% for combined variables and transient events, which is comparable to the performance of previous feature-based models. Our trained model can be utilized directly to other missions, such as ASAS-SN, without requiring any retraining or fine-tuning. To address known issues with miscalibrated predictive probabilities, we apply conformal prediction to generate robust predictive sets that guarantee true label coverage with a given probability. Additionally, we incorporate various anomaly detection algorithms to empower our model with the ability to identify out-of-distribution objects. Our framework is implemented in the Deep-LC toolkit, which is an open-source Python package hosted on Github and PyPI.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar search is always the basis of pulsar navigation, gravitational wave detection and other research topics. Currently, the volume of pulsar candidates collected by Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) shows an explosive growth rate that has brought challenges for its pulsar candidate filtering System. Particularly, the multi-view heterogeneous data and class imbalance between true pulsars and non-pulsar candidates have negative effects on traditional single-modal supervised classification methods. In this study, a multi-modal and semi-supervised learning based pulsar candidate sifting algorithm is presented, which adopts a hybrid ensemble clustering scheme of density-based and partition-based methods combined with a feature-level fusion strategy for input data and a data partition strategy for parallelization. Experiments on both HTRU (The High Time Resolution Universe Survey) 2 and FAST actual observation data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm could excellently identify the pulsars: On HTRU2, the precision and recall rates of its parallel mode reach 0.981 and 0.988. On FAST data, those of its parallel mode reach 0.891 and 0.961, meanwhile, the running time also significantly decrease with the increment of parallel nodes within limits. So, we can get the conclusion that our algorithm could be a feasible idea for large scale pulsar candidate sifting of FAST drift scan observation.

 - **Abstract**
 Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the state-of-the-art technique for identifying strong gravitational lenses. Although they are highly successful in recovering genuine lens systems with a high true-positive rate, the unbalanced nature of the data set (lens systems are rare), still leads to a high false positive rate. For these techniques to be successful in upcoming surveys (e.g. with Euclid) most emphasis should be set on reducing false positives, rather than on reducing false negatives. In this paper, we introduce densely connected neural networks (DenseNets) as the CNN architecture in a new pipeline-ensemble model containing an ensemble of classification CNNs and regression CNNs to classify and rank-order lenses, respectively. We show that DenseNets achieve comparable true positive rates but considerably lower false positive rates (when compared to residual networks; ResNets). Thus, we recommend DenseNets for future missions involving large data sets, such as Euclid, where low false positive rates play a key role in the automated follow-up and analysis of large numbers of strong gravitational lens candidates when human vetting is no longer feasible

 - **Abstract**
 New photometry, including TESS data, have been combined with recent spectroscopic observations of the Orion Ib pulsating triple-star system VV Ori. This yields a revised set of absolute parameters with increased precision. Two different programs were utilized for the light curve analysis, with results in predictably close agreement. The agreement promotes confidence in the analysis procedures. The spectra were analysed using the {\sc FDBinary} program. The main parameters are as follows: $M_1 = 11.6 \pm 0.14$ and $M_2 = 4.8 \pm 0.06$ (M$_\odot$). We estimate an approximate mass of the wide companion as $M_3 = 2.0 \pm 0.3$ M$_\odot$. Similarly, $R_{1} = 5.11 \pm 0.03$, $R_2 = 2.51 \pm 0.02$, $R_3 = 1.8 \pm 0.1$ (R$_\odot$); $T_{\rm e 1} = 26600 \pm 300$, $T_{\rm e 2} = 16300 \pm 400$ and $T_{\rm e 3} = 10000 \pm 1000$ (K). The close binary's orbital separation is $a= 13.91$ (R$_\odot$); its age is $8 \pm 2$ (Myr) and its photometric distance is $396 \pm 7$ pc. The primary's $\beta$ Cep type oscillations support these properties and confirm our understanding of its evolutionary status. Examination of the well-defined $\lambda$6678 He I profiles reveals the primary to have a significantly low projected rotation: some 80\% of the synchronous value. This can be explained on the basis of the precession of an unaligned spin axis. This proposal can resolve also observed variations of the apparent inclination and address other longer-term irregularities of the system reported in the literature. This topic invites further observations and follow-up theoretical study of the dynamics of this intriguing young multiple star.

 - **Abstract**
 Revealing the temporal evolution of individual heavy elements synthesized in the merger ejecta from binary neutron star mergers not only improves our understanding of the origin of heavy elements beyond iron but also clarifies the energy sources of kilonovae. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the temporal evolution of the energy fraction of each nuclide based on the $r$-process nucleosynthesis simulations. The heavy elements dominating the kilonova emission within $\sim100$~days are identified, including $^{127}$Sb, $^{128}$Sb, $^{129}$Sb, $^{130}$Sb, $^{129}$Te, $^{132}$I, $^{222}$Rn, $^{223}$Ra, $^{224}$Ra, and $^{225}$Ac. It is found that the late-time kilonova light curve ($t\gtrsim20$~days) is highly sensitive to the presence of the heavy element $^{225}$Ac (with a half-life of 10.0~days). Our analysis shows that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its high sensitivity in the near-infrared band, is a powerful instrument for the identification of these specific heavy elements.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation offers a unique window into the early Universe, facilitating precise examinations of fundamental cosmological theories. However, the quest for detecting B-modes in the CMB, predicted by theoretical models of inflation, faces substantial challenges in terms of calibration and foreground modeling. The COSMOCal (COsmic Survey of Millimeter wavelengths Objects for CMB experiments Calibration) project aims at enhancing the accuracy of the absolute calibration of the polarization angle $\psi$ of current and future CMB experiments. The concept includes the build of a very well known artificial source emitting in the frequency range [20-350] GHz that would act as an absolute calibrator for several polarization facilities on Earth. A feasibility study to place the artificial source in geostationary orbit, in the far field for all the telescopes on Earth, is ongoing. In the meanwhile ongoing hardware work is dedicated to build a prototype to test the technology, the precision and the stability of the polarization recovering in the 1 mm band (220-300 GHz). High-resolution experiments as the NIKA2 camera at the IRAM 30m telescope will be deployed for such use. Once carefully calibrated ($\Delta\psi$ < 0.1 degrees) it will be used to observe astrophysical sources such as the Crab nebula, which is the best candidate in the sky for the absolute calibration of CMB experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 By coupling the EUropean Heliospheric FORcasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA) and the improved Particle Acceleration and Transport in the Heliosphere (iPATH) model, two energetic storm particle (ESP) events, originating from the same active region (AR 13088) and observed by Solar Orbiter (SolO) on August 31 2022 and September 05 2022, are modelled. While both events originated from the same active region, they exhibited notable differences, including: 1) the August ESP event lasted for 7 hours, while the September event persisted for 16 hours; 2) The time intensity profiles for the September event showed a clear cross-over upstream of the shock where the intensity of higher energy protons exceeds those of lower energy protons, leading to positive (``reverse'') spectral indices prior to the shock passage. For both events, our simulations replicate the observed duration of the shock sheath, depending on the deceleration history of the CME. Imposing different choices of escaping length scale, which is related to the decay of upstream turbulence, the modelled time intensity profiles prior to the shock arrival also agree with observations. In particular, the cross-over of this time profile in the September event is well reproduced. We show that a ``reverse'' upstream spectrum is the result of the interplay between two length scales. One characterizes the decay of upstream shock accelerated particles, which are controlled by the energy-dependent diffusion coefficient, and the other characterizes the decay of upstream turbulence power, which is related to the process of how streaming protons upstream of the shock excite Alfv\'{e}n waves. Simulations taking into account real-time background solar wind, the dynamics of the CME propagation, and upstream turbulence at the shock front are necessary to thoroughly understand the ESP phase of large SEP events.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first large-scale 3D kinematic study of ~2000 spectroscopically-confirmed young stars (<20 Myr) in 18 star clusters and OB associations (hereafter groups) from the combination of Gaia astrometry and Gaia-ESO Survey spectroscopy. We measure 3D velocity dispersions for all groups, which range from 0.61 to 7.4 km/s (1D velocity dispersions of 0.35 to 4.3 km/s). We find the majority of groups have anisotropic velocity dispersions, suggesting they are not dynamically relaxed. From the 3D velocity dispersions, measured radii and estimates of total mass we estimate the virial state and find that all systems are super-virial when only the stellar mass is considered, but that some systems are sub-virial when the mass of the molecular cloud is taken into account. We observe an approximately linear correlation between the 3D velocity dispersion and the group mass, which would imply that the virial state of groups scales as the square root of the group mass. However, we do not observe a strong correlation between virial state and group mass. In agreement with their virial state we find that nearly all of the groups studied are in the process of expanding and that the expansion is anisotropic, implying that groups were not spherical prior to expansion. One group, Rho Oph, is found to be contracting and in a sub-virial state (when the mass of the surrounding molecular cloud is considered). This work provides a glimpse of the potential of the combination of Gaia and data from the next generation of spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The ages of young star clusters are fundamental clocks to constrain the formation and evolution of pre-main-sequence stars and their protoplanetary disks and exoplanets. However, dating methods for very young clusters often disagree, casting doubts on the accuracy of the derived ages. We propose a new method to derive the kinematic age of star clusters based on the evaporation ages of their stars. The method is validated and calibrated using hundreds of clusters identified in a supernova-driven simulation of the interstellar medium forming stars for approximately 40 Myr within a 250 pc region. We demonstrate that the clusters' evaporation-age uncertainty can be as small as about 10% for clusters with a large enough number of evaporated stars and small but realistic observational errors. We have obtained evaporation ages for a pilot sample of 10 clusters, finding a good agreement with their published isochronal ages. The evaporation ages will provide important constraints for modeling the pre-main-sequence evolution of low-mass stars, as well as to investigate the star-formation and gas-evaporation history of young clusters. These ages can be more accurate than isochronal ages for very young clusters, for which observations and models are more uncertain.
