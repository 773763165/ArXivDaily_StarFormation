 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a thorough analysis of seismic and acoustic data from the so-called `Interstellar Meteor' which entered the Earth's atmosphere off the coast of Papua New Guinea on 2014-01-08. We conclude that both previously-reported seismic signals are spurious - one has characteristics suggesting a local vehicular-traffic based origin; whilst the other is statistically indistinguishable from the background noise. As such, previously-reported localisations based on this data are spurious. Analysis of acoustic data cannot provides a best fit location estimate which is very far ($\sim$170~km) from the reported fireball location. Accordingly, we conclude that material recovered from the seafloor and purported to be from the meteor is almost certainly unrelated to it, and is likely of more mundane (non-interstellar) origin.

 - **Abstract**
 The majority of massive stars are expected to exchange mass or merge with a companion during their lives. This immediately implies that most supernovae (SNe) are from such post-mass-exchange objects. Here, we explore how mass accretion and merging affect the pre-SN structures of stars and their final fates. We use the stellar evolution code MESA, infer the outcome of core-collapse using a neutrino-driven SN model, and apply a rapid-accretion model. Our models cover initial masses from 11 to 70 Msun and the accreted mass ranges from 10-200% of the initial mass. We find that mass accretion in particular onto post-main-sequence (post-MS) stars can lead to a long-lived blue supergiant (BSG) phase. In comparison to genuine single stars, post-MS accretors have small core-to-total mass ratios, regardless of whether they end their lives as BSGs or cool supergiants (CSGs), and they can have genuinely different pre-SN core structures. As in single and binary-stripped stars, we find black-hole (BH) formation for the same characteristic CO core masses M_CO of ~7 Msun and >13 Msun. In models with the largest mass accretion, the BH-formation landscape as a function of M_CO is shifted by about 0.5 Msun to lower masses. We find a tight relation between our neutron-star (NS) masses and the central entropy of the pre-SN models, suggesting a universal relation that is independent of the evolutionary history of stars. Post-MS accretors explode both as BSGs and CSGs, and we show how to understand their pre-SN locations in the Hertzsprung--Russell diagram. Some BSGs that avoid the luminous-blue-variable (LBV) regime are predicted to collapse into BHs of up to 50 Msun while others explode in supernovae and eject up to 40 Msun, greatly exceeding ejecta masses from single stars. These masses can be even higher at lower metallicities, and they may fall into the pair-instability-supernova mass gap. [abridged]
#### Direct Imaging Discovery of a Substellar Companion Orbiting the  Accelerating Variable Star, HIP 39017

 - **Abstract**
 We present the direct imaging discovery of a substellar companion (a massive planet or low-mass brown dwarf) to the young, $\gamma$ Doradus-type variable star, HIP 39017 (HD 65526). The companion's SCExAO/CHARIS JHK ($1.1-2.4\mu$m) spectrum and Keck/NIRC2 L$^{\prime}$ photometry indicate that it is an L/T transition object. A comparison of the JHK+L$^{\prime}$ spectrum to several atmospheric model grids finds a significantly better fit to cloudy models than cloudless models. Orbit modeling with relative astrometry and precision stellar astrometry from Hipparcos and Gaia yields a semi-major axis of $23.8^{+8.7}_{-6.1}$ au, a dynamical companion mass of $30^{+31}_{-12}$~M$_J$, and a mass ratio of $\sim$1.9\%, properties most consistent with low-mass brown dwarfs. However, its mass estimated from luminosity models is a lower $\sim$13.8 $M_{\rm J}$ due to an estimated young age ($\lesssim$ 115 Myr); using a weighted posterior distribution informed by conservative mass constraints from luminosity evolutionary models yields a lower dynamical mass of $23.6_{-7.4}^{+9.1}$~M$_J$ and a mass ratio of $\sim$1.4\%. Analysis of the host star's multi-frequency $\gamma$ Dor-type pulsations, astrometric monitoring of HIP 39017b, and Gaia DR4 astrometry of the star will clarify the system age and better constrain the mass and orbit of the companion. This discovery further reinforces the improved efficiency of targeted direct imaging campaigns informed by long-baseline, precision stellar astrometry.

 - **Abstract**
 The measurements of the bulk properties of most isolated neutron stars (INSs) are challenging tasks. Tang et al. (2020) have developed a new method, based on the equation of state (EoS) of neutron star (NS) material constrained by the observational data, to infer the gravitational masses of a few INSs whose gravitational redshifts are available. However, in that work, the authors only considered the constraints on the EoS from nuclear experiments/theories and the gravitational wave data of GW170817; the possible phase transition has not been taken into account. In this work, we adopt three EoS models (including the one incorporates a first-order strong phase transition) that are constrained by the latest multimessenger NS data, including in particular the recent mass\textendash radius measurements of two NSs by Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer, to update the estimation of the gravitational masses of RBS 1223, RX J0720.4-3125, and RX J1856.5-3754. In comparison to our previous approach, the new constraints are tighter, and the gravitational masses are larger by about $0.1M_\odot$. All the inferred gravitational masses are within the range of the NS masses measured in other ways. We have also calculated the radius, tidal-deformability, and moment of inertia of these sources. The inclusion of the first-order strong phase transition has little influence on modifying the results.
#### The Core Mass Function Across Galactic Environments. IV. The Galactic  Center

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) and how it may vary with galactic environment is a matter of debate. Certain star formation theories involve a close connection between the IMF and the Core Mass Function (CMF) and so it is important to measure this CMF in a range of locations in the Milky Way. Here we study the CMF of three Galactic Center clouds: G0.253+0.016 ("The Brick"), Sgr B2 (Deep South field) and Sgr C. We use ALMA 1 mm continuum images and identify cores as peaks in thermal dust emission via the dendrogram algorithm. We develop a completeness correction method via synthetic core insertion, where a realistic mass-dependent size distribution is used for the synthetic cores. After corrections, a power law of the form $\text{d}N/\text{d}\log M \propto M^{-\alpha}$ is fit to the CMFs above 2 M$_\odot$. The three regions show disparate CMFs, with the Brick showing a Salpeter-like power law index $\alpha=1.21\pm0.11$ and the other two regions showing shallower indices ($\alpha=0.92\pm0.09$ for Sgr C and $\alpha=0.66\pm0.05$ for Sgr B2-DS). Furthermore, we analyze the spatial distribution and mass segregation of cores in each region. Sgr C and Sgr B2-DS show signs of mass segregation, but the Brick does not. We compare our results to several other CMFs from different Galactic regions derived with the same methods. Finally, we discuss how these results may help define an evolutionary sequence of star cluster formation and can be used to test star formation theories.
#### Dynamics of 2023 FW14, the second L4 Mars trojan, and a physical  characterization using the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Known Mars trojans could be primordial small bodies that have remained in their present-day orbits for the age of the Solar System. Their orbital distribution is strongly asymmetric; there are over a dozen objects at the L5 point and just one at L4, (121514) 1999 UJ7. Most L5 trojans appear to form a collision-induced asteroid cluster, known as the Eureka family. Asteroid 2023 FW14 was recently discovered and it has a robust orbit determination that may be consistent with a Mars trojan status. Aims. Our aim is determine the nature and dynamical properties of 2023 FW14. Methods. We carried out an observational study of 2023 FW14 to derive its spectral class using the OSIRIS camera spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias. We investigated its possible trojan resonance with Mars using direct N-body simulations. Results. The reflectance spectrum of 2023 FW14 is not compatible with the olivine-rich composition of the Eureka family; it also does not resemble the composition of the Moon, although (101429) 1998 VF31 does. The Eureka family and 101429 are at the L5 point. The spectrum of 2023 FW14 is also different from two out of the three spectra in the literature of the other known L4 trojan, 121514, which are of C-type. The visible spectrum of 2023 FW14 is consistent with that of an X-type asteroid, as is the third spectrum of 121514. Our calculations confirm that 2023 FW14 is the second known L4 Mars trojan although it is unlikely to be primordial; it may remain in its present-day tadpole path for several million years before transferring to a Mars-crossing orbit. It might be a fragment of 121514, but a capture scenario seems more likely. Conclusions. The discovery of 2023 FW14 suggests that regular Mars-crossing asteroids can be captured as temporary Mars trojans.

 - **Abstract**
 High angular resolution imaging is an increasingly important capability in contemporary astrophysics. Of particular relevance to emerging fields such as the characterisation of exoplanetary systems, imaging at the required spatial scales and contrast levels results in forbidding challenges in the correction of atmospheric phase errors, which in turn drives demanding requirements for precise wavefront sensing. Asgard is the next-generation instrument suite at the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), targeting advances in sensitivity, spectral resolution and nulling interferometry. In this paper, we describe the requirements and designs of three core modules: Heimdallr, a beam combiner for fringe tracking, low order wavefront correction and visibility science; Baldr, a Zernike wavefront sensor to correct high order atmospheric aberrations; and Solarstein, an alignment and calibration unit. In addition, we draw generalisable insights for designing such system and discuss integration plans.

 - **Abstract**
 Simulations of pre-supernova evolution suggest that some intense shell burning can be so active that, in extreme cases, it can merge with the outer shell, changing the initial conditions for the supernova explosion. However, such violent activity in the interior of stars has been difficult to confirm from observations of stars. Here we propose that the elemental composition of O-rich ejecta in supernova remnants can be a tool to test for this kind of intense shell burning activity in the final stages of progenitor evolution. As an example, we discuss the origin of "Mg-rich" ejecta in the supernova remnant N49B. A high Mg/Ne mass ratio $\gtrsim 1$ suggests that the Ne- or O-burning shell has broken into or merged with the outer shell before the collapse. Such Mg-rich (or Ne-poor) ejecta has been identified in some other supernova remnants, supporting the idea that some destratification process, such as a shell merger, does indeed occur in the interiors of some massive stars, although they may not be the majority. Our results suggest that X-ray observations of O-rich ejecta in core-collapse supernova remnants will be a unique tool to probe the shell burning activity during the final stage of a massive star's interior.
#### Partial tidal disruption events: The elixir of life

 - **Abstract**
 In our Galactic Center, about 10,000 to 100,000 stars are estimated to have survived tidal disruption events, resulting in partially disrupted remnants. These events occur when a supermassive black hole (SMBH) tidally interacts with a star, but not enough to completely disrupt the star. We use the 1D stellar evolution code Kepler and the 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics code Phantom to model the tidal disruption of 1, 3, and 10 solar mass stars at zero-age (ZAMS), middle-age (MAMS), and terminal-age main-sequence (TAMS). We map the disruption remnants into Kepler in order to understand their post-distribution evolution. We find distinct characteristics in the remnants, including increased radius, rapid core rotation, and differential rotation in the envelope. The remnants undergo composition mixing that affects their stellar evolution. Whereas the remnants formed by disruption of ZAMS models evolve similarly to unperturbed models of the same mass, for MAMS and TAMS stars, the remnants have higher luminosity and effective temperature. Potential observational signatures include peculiarities in nitrogen and carbon abundances, higher luminosity, rapid rotation, faster evolution, and unique tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram

 - **Abstract**
 Impact craters are the primary geomorphic features on the surfaces of celestial bodies such as the Moon, and their formation has significant implications for the evolutionary history of the celestial body. The study of the impact crater formation process relies mainly on numerical simulation methods, with two-dimensional simulations capable of reproducing general patterns of impact processes while conserving computational resources. However, to mitigate the artificial reflections of shock waves at numerical boundaries, a common approach involves expanding the computational domain, greatly reducing the efficiency of numerical simulations. In this study, we developed a novel two-dimensional code SALEc-2D that employs the perfect matched layer (PML) method to suppress artificial reflections at numerical boundaries. This method enhances computational efficiency while ensuring reliable results. Additionally, we implemented MPI parallel algorithms in the new code to further improve computational efficiency. Simulations that would take over ten hours using the conventional iSALE-2D code can now be completed in less than half an hour using our code, SALEc-2D, on a standard computer. We anticipate that our code will find widespread application in numerical simulations of impact craters in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 There is solid theoretical and observational motivation behind the idea of scale-invariance as a fundamental symmetry of Nature. We consider a recently proposed classically scale-invariant inflationary model, quadratic in curvature and featuring a scalar field non-minimally coupled to gravity. We go beyond earlier analytical studies, which showed that the model predicts inflationary observables in qualitative agreement with data, by solving the full two-field dynamics of the system -- this allows us to corroborate previous analytical findings and set robust constraints on the model's parameters using the latest Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck and BICEP/Keck. We demonstrate that scale-invariance constrains the two-field trajectory such that the effective dynamics are that of a single field, resulting in vanishing entropy perturbations and protecting the model from destabilization effects. We derive tight upper limits on the non-minimal coupling strength, excluding conformal coupling at high significance. By explicitly sampling over them, we demonstrate an overall insensitivity to initial conditions. We argue that the model \textit{predicts} a minimal level of primordial tensor modes set by $r \gtrsim 0.003$, well within the reach of next-generation CMB experiments. These will therefore provide a litmus test of scale-invariant inflation, and we comment on the possibility of distinguishing the model from Starobinsky and $\alpha$-attractor inflation. Overall, we argue that scale-invariant inflation is in excellent health, and possesses features which make it an interesting benchmark for tests of inflation from future CMB data.
#### Impacts of source morphology on the detectability of subhalos in strong  lenses

 - **Abstract**
 We provide an analysis of a convolutional neural network's ability to identify the lensing signal of single dark matter subhalos in strong galaxy-galaxy lenses in the presence of increasingly complex source light morphology. We simulate a balanced dataset of 800,000 strong lens images both perturbed and unperturbed by a single subhalo ranging in virial mass between $10^{7.5} M_{\odot} - 10^{11}M_{\odot}$ and characterise the source complexity by the number of Sersic clumps present in the source plane ranging from 1 to 5. Using the ResNet50 architecture we train the network to classify images as either perturbed or unperturbed. We find that the network is able to detect subhalos at low enough masses to distinguish between dark matter models even with complex sources and that source complexity has little impact on the accuracy beyond 3 clumps. The model was more confident in its classification when the clumps in the source were compact, but cared little about their spatial distribution. We also tested for the resolution of the data, finding that even in conditions akin to natural seeing the model was still able to achieve an accuracy of 74% in our highest peak signal-to-noise datasets, though this is heavily dominated by the high mass subhalos. It's robustness against resolution is attributed to the model learning the flux ratio anomalies in the perturbed lenses which are conserved in the lower resolution data.
#### Fast fitting of spectral lines with Gaussian and hyperfine structure  models

 - **Abstract**
 The fitting of spectral lines is a common step in the analysis of line observations and simulations. However, the observational noise, the presence of multiple velocity components, and potentially large data sets make it a non-trivial task. We present a new computer program Spectrum Iterative Fitter (SPIF) for the fitting of spectra with Gaussians or with hyperfine line profiles. The aim is to show the computational efficiency of the program and to use it to examine the general accuracy of approximating spectra with simple models. We describe the implementation of the program. To characterise its performance, we examined spectra with isolated Gaussian components or a hyperfine structure, also using synthetic observations from numerical simulations of interstellar clouds. We examined the search for the globally optimal fit and the accuracy to which single-velocity-component and multi-component fits recover true values for parameters such as line areas, velocity dispersion, and optical depth. The program is shown to be fast, with fits of single Gaussian components reaching on graphics processing units speeds approaching one million spectra per second. This also makes it feasible to use Monte Carlo simulations or Markov chain Monte Carlo calculations for the error estimation. However, in the case of hyperfine structure lines, degeneracies affect the parameter estimation and can complicate the derivation of the error estimates. The use of many random initial values makes the fits more robust, both for locating the global $\chi^2$ minimum and for the selection of the optimal number of velocity components.
#### VLBI detection of nearby (< 100 pc) young stars: Pilot observations

 - **Abstract**
 To increase the number of sources with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) astrometry available for comparison with the Gaia results, we have observed 31 young stars with recently reported radio emission. These stars are all in the Gaia DR3 catalog and were suggested, on the basis of conventional interferometry observations, to be non-thermal radio emitters and, therefore, good candidates for VLBI detections. The observations were carried out with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at two epochs separated by a few days and yielded 10 detections (a $\sim$30\% detection rate). Using the astrometric Gaia results, we have extrapolated the target positions to the epochs of our radio observations and compared them with the position of the radio sources. For seven objects, the optical and radio positions are coincident within five times their combined position errors. Three targets, however, have position discrepancies above eight times the position errors, indicating different emitting sources at optical and radio wavelengths. In one case, the VLBA emission is very likely associated with a known companion of the primary target. In the other two cases, we associate the VLBA emission with previously unknown companions, but further observations will be needed to confirm this.
#### Emission lines due to ionizing radiation from a compact object in the  remnant of Supernova 1987A

 - **Abstract**
 The nearby Supernova 1987A was accompanied by a burst of neutrino emission, which indicates that a compact object (a neutron star or black hole) was formed in the explosion. There has been no direct observation of this compact object. In this work, we observe the supernova remnant with JWST spectroscopy finding narrow infrared emission lines of argon and sulphur. The line emission is spatially unresolved and blueshifted in velocity relative to the supernova rest frame. We interpret the lines as gas illuminated by a source of ionizing photons located close to the center of the expanding ejecta. Photoionization models show that the line ratios are consistent with ionization by a cooling neutron star or pulsar wind nebula. The velocity shift could be evidence for a neutron star natal kick.

 - **Abstract**
 A large number of mergers of binary black holes (BHs) have been discovered by gravitational wave observations since the first detection of gravitational waves 2015. Binary BH mergers are the loudest events in the universe, however their origin(s) have been under debate. There have been many suggestions for merging binary BHs. Isolated binary stars are one of the most promising origins. We have investigated the evolution of isolated binary stars ranging from zero metallicity (Population III stars or Pop III stars) to the solar metallicity by means of so-called rapid binary population synthesis simulation. We have found that binary BHs formed from isolated binary stars reproduce the redshift evolution of the merger rate density and the distribution of primary BH masses and mass ratios inferred by Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 3 (GWTC-3). Pop III stars have a crucial role in forming merging binary BHs in so-called the pair instability mass gap. Note that we choose the conventional prescription of pair instability mass loss, based on the standard $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate. Finally, we have shown the redshift evolution of the rate density of pair instability supernovae, and have predicted that a few pair instability supernovae would be discovered in the next few years. The discoveries would validate our results of merging binary BHs.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to determine the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios for HCN in six starless and prestellar cores and compare the results between the direct method using radiative transfer modeling and the indirect double isotope method assuming a fixed $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio. We present IRAM 30m observations of the HCN 1-0, HCN 3-2, HC15N 1-0 and H13CN 1-0 transitions toward six embedded cores. The ${}^{14}$N/${}^{15}$N ratio was derived using both the indirect double isotope method and directly through non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) 1D radiative transfer modeling of the HCN emission. The latter also provides the ${}^{12}$C/${}^{13}$C ratio, which we compared to the local interstellar value. The derived ${}^{14}$N/${}^{15}$N ratios using the indirect method are generally in the range of 300-550. This result could suggest an evolutionary trend in the nitrogen fractionation of HCN between starless cores and later stages of the star formation process. However, the direct method reveals lower fractionation ratios of around $\sim$250, mainly resulting from a lower ${}^{12}$C/${}^{13}$C ratio in the range $\sim$20-40, as compared to the local interstellar medium value of 68. This study reveals a significant difference between the nitrogen fractionation ratio in HCN derived using direct and indirect methods. This can influence the interpretation of the chemical evolution and reveal the pitfalls of the indirect double isotope method for fractionation studies. However, the direct method is challenging, as it requires well-constrained source models to produce accurate results. No trend in the nitrogen fractionation of HCN between earlier and later stages of the star formation process is evident when the results of the direct method are considered.

 - **Abstract**
 The Ion Composition Analyzer (ICA) on the Rosetta spacecraft observed both the solar wind and the cometary ionosphere around comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko for nearly two years. However, observations of low energy cometary ions were affected by a highly negative spacecraft potential, and the ICA ion density estimates were often much lower than plasma densities found by other instruments. Since the low energy cometary ions are often the highest density population in the plasma environment, it is nonetheless desirable to understand their properties. To do so, we select ICA data with densities comparable to those of Rosetta's Langmuir Probe (LAP)/Mutual Impedance Probe throughout the mission. We then correct the cometary ion energy distribution of each energy-angle scan for spacecraft potential and fit a drifting Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, which gives an estimate of the drift energy and temperature for 3521 scans. The resulting drift energy is generally between 11--18 eV and the temperature between 0.5--1 eV. The drift energy shows good agreement with published ion flow speeds from LAP during the same time period and is much higher than the cometary neutral speed. We see additional higher energy cometary ions in the spectra closest to perihelion, which can either be a second Maxwellian or a kappa distribution. The energy and temperature are negatively correlated with heliocentric distance, but the slope of the change is small. It cannot be quantitatively determined whether this trend is primarily due to heliocentric distance or spacecraft distance to the comet, which increased with decreasing heliocentric distance.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the detailed characterization of the HD 77946 planetary system. HD 77946 is an F5 ($M_*$ = 1.17 M$_{\odot}$, $R_*$ = 1.31 R$_{\odot}$) star, which hosts a transiting planet recently discovered by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), classified as TOI-1778 b. Using TESS photometry, high-resolution spectroscopic data from HARPS-N, and photometry from CHEOPS, we measure the radius and mass from the transit and RV observations, and find that the planet, HD 77946 b, orbits with period $P_{\rm b}$ = $6.527282_{-0.000020}^{+0.000015}$ d, has a mass of $M_{\rm b} = 8.38\pm{1.32}$M$_\oplus$, and a radius of $R_{\rm b} = 2.705_{-0.081}^{+0.086}$R$_\oplus$. From the combination of mass and radius measurements, and the stellar chemical composition, the planet properties suggest that HD 77946 b is a sub-Neptune with a $\sim$1\% H/He atmosphere. However, a degeneracy still exists between water-world and silicate/iron-hydrogen models, and even though interior structure modelling of this planet favours a sub-Neptune with a H/He layer that makes up a significant fraction of its radius, a water-world composition cannot be ruled out, as with $T_{\rm eq} = 1248^{+40}_{-38}~$K, water may be in a supercritical state. The characterisation of HD 77946 b, adding to the small sample of well-characterised sub-Neptunes, is an important step forwards on our journey to understanding planetary formation and evolution pathways. Furthermore, HD 77946 b has one of the highest transmission spectroscopic metrics for small planets orbiting hot stars, thus transmission spectroscopy of this key planet could prove vital for constraining the compositional confusion that currently surrounds small exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 Our aim in this paper is to refine the orbital and physical parameters of the HATS-2 planetary system and study transit timing variations and atmospheric composition thanks to transit observations that span more than ten years and that were collected using different instruments and pass-band filters. We also investigate the orbital alignment of the system by studying the anomalies in the transit light curves induced by starspots on the photosphere of the parent star. We analysed new transit events from both ground-based telescopes and NASA's TESS mission. Anomalies were detected in most of the light curves and modelled as starspots occulted by the planet during transit events. We fitted the clean and symmetric light curves with the JKTEBOP code and those affected by anomalies with the PRISM+GEMC codes to simultaneously model the photometric parameters of the transits and the position, size, and contrast of each starspot. We found consistency between the values we found for the physical and orbital parameters and those from the discovery paper and ATLAS9 stellar atmospherical models. We identified different sets of consecutive starspot-crossing events that temporally occurred in less than five days. Under the hypothesis that we are dealing with the same starspots, occulted twice by the planet during two consecutive transits, we estimated the rotational period of the parent star and, in turn the projected and the true orbital obliquity of the planet. We find that the system is well aligned. We identified the possible presence of transit timing variations in the system, which can be caused by tidal orbital decay, and we derived a low-resolution transmission spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 We have detected solar-like oscillations in the mid K-dwarf $\varepsilon$ Indi A, making it the coolest dwarf to have measured oscillations. The star is noteworthy for harboring a pair of brown dwarf companions and a Jupiter-type planet. We observed $\varepsilon$ Indi A during two radial velocity campaigns, using the high-resolution spectrographs HARPS (2011) and UVES (2021). Weighting the time series, we computed the power spectra and established the detection of solar-like oscillations with a power excess located at $5265 \pm 110 \ \mu$Hz -- the highest frequency solar-like oscillations so far measured in any star. The measurement of the center of the power excess allows us to compute a stellar mass of $0.782 \pm 0.023 \ M_\odot$ based on scaling relations and a known radius from interferometry. We also determine the amplitude of the peak power and note that there is a slight difference between the two observing campaigns, indicating a varying activity level. Overall, this work confirms that low-amplitude solar-like oscillations can be detected in mid-K type stars in radial velocity measurements obtained with high-precision spectrographs.
#### Revealing the variation mechanism of ON 231 via the two-components  shock-in-jet model

 - **Abstract**
 The variation mechanism of blazars is a long-standing unresolved problem. In this work, we present a scenario to explain diverse variation phenomena for ON 231, where the jet emissions are composed of the flaring and the less variable components (most probably from the post-flaring blobs), and the variation is dominated by shock-in-jet instead of the Doppler effect. We perform correlation analysis for the multiwavelength light curves and find no significant correlations. For optical band, ON 231 exhibits a harder when brighter (HWB) trend, and the trend seems to shift at different periods. Correspondingly, the correlation between polarization degree and flux exhibits a V-shaped behavior, and a similar translation relation during different periods is also found. These phenomena could be understood via the superposition of the flaring component and slowly varying background component. We also find that the slopes of HWB trend become smaller at higher flux levels, which indicates the energy-dependent acceleration processes of the radiative particles. For X-ray, we discover a trend transition from HWB to softer when brighter (SWB) to HWB. We consider that the X-ray emission is composed of both the synchrotron tail and the Synchrotron Self-Compton components, which could be described by two log-parabolic functions. By varying the peak frequency, we reproduce the observed trend transition in a quantitative manner. For $\gamma$-ray, we find the SWB trend, which could be explained naturally if a very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray background component exists. Our study elucidates the variation mechanism of intermediate synchrotron-peaked BL Lac objects.

 - **Abstract**
 The process of forming a circumbinary planet is thought to be intimately related to the structure of the nascent circumbinary disc. It has been shown that the structure of a circumbinary disc depends strongly on 3-dimensional effects and on the detailed modelling of the thermodynamics. Here, we employ 3-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, combined with a proper treatment of the thermal physics using the RADMC-3D radiation transport code, to examine the location of the snow line in circumbinary discs. The models have application to the circumbinary planets that have been discovered in recent years by the Kepler and TESS transit surveys. We find that the snow line is located in a narrow region of the circumbinary disc, close to the inner cavity that is carved out by the central binary, at typical orbital distances of $\sim 1.5-2$ AU for the system parameters considered. In this region, previous work has shown that both grain growth and pebble accretion are likely to be inefficient because of the presence of hydrodynamical turbulence. Hence, in situ planet formation interior to the snow line is unlikely to occur and circumbinary planets should preferentially be icy, not rocky.

 - **Abstract**
 Cross sections and rate coefficients for the Dissociative Recombination (DR) of the NS+ ion induced by collisions with low-energy electrons are reported for temperatures between 10 and 1000 K, relevant to a large range of interstellar cloud temperatures. Uncertainties are discussed for these rates. Comparisons are made with DR rates for the isovalent NO+ molecular ion which are found to be much faster. The present findings lead to a moderate dissociative reaction rate coefficient, smaller by a factor of 2 than the current estimates reported in the different kinetic databases for a temperature of 10 K. We consider that our rate coefficients obtained through multichannel quantum defect theory for NS+ are likely to be better than those displayed in the different kinetic databases.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar activity and planetary effects induce radial velocity (RV) offsets and cause temporal distortions in the shape of the stellar line profile. Hence, accurately probing the stellar line profile offers a wealth of information on both the star itself and any orbiting planets. Typically, Cross-Correlation Functions (CCFs) are used as a proxy for the stellar line profile. The shape of CCFs, however, can be distorted by line blending and aliasing limiting the stellar and planetary physics that can be probed from them. Least-squares deconvolution (LSD) offers an alternative that directly fits the mean line profile of the spectrum to produce a high-precision profile. In this paper, we introduce our novel method ACID (Accurate Continuum fItting and Deconvolution) that builds on LSD techniques by simultaneously fitting the spectral continuum and line profile as well as performing LSD in effective optical depth. Tests on model data revealed ACID can accurately identify and correct the spectral continuum to retrieve an injected line profile. ACID was also applied to archival HARPS data obtained during the transit of HD189733b. The application of the Reloaded Rossiter-McLaughlin technique to both ACID profiles and HARPS CCFs shows ACID residual profiles improved the out-of-line RMS by over 5% compared to CCFs. Furthermore, ACID profiles are shown to exhibit a Voigt profile shape that better describes the expected profile shape of the stellar line profile. This improved representation shows that ACID better preserves the stellar and planetary physics encoded in the stellar line profile shape for slow rotating stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the identification of 89 new systems containing ultracool dwarf companions to main sequence stars and white dwarfs, using the citizen science project Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 and cross-reference between Gaia and CatWISE2020. Thirty-two of these companions and thirty-three host stars were followed up with spectroscopic observations, with companion spectral types ranging from M7-T9 and host spectral types ranging from G2-M9. These systems exhibit diverse characteristics, from young to old ages, blue to very red spectral morphologies, potential membership to known young moving groups, and evidence of spectral binarity in 9 companions. Twenty of the host stars in our sample show evidence for higher order multiplicity, with an additional 11 host stars being resolved binaries themselves. We compare this sample's characteristics with those of the known stellar binary and exoplanet populations, and find our sample begins to fill in the gap between directly imaged exoplanets and stellary binaries on mass ratio-binding energy plots. With this study, we increase the population of ultracool dwarf companions to FGK stars by $\sim$42\%, and more than triple the known population of ultracool dwarf companions with separations larger than 1,000 au, providing excellent targets for future atmospheric retrievals.

 - **Abstract**
 We have developed a method to determine the most reliable distances for a large group of planetary nebulae. For this purpose, we analyze the distances obtained from \textit{Gaia} parallaxes and three determinations of statistical distances. The most reliable distance is derived for 2211 objects, and uncertainties for these distances are calculated in a homogeneous way. Using our most reliable distances, we compare the distributions of Galactic heights of hydrogen-poor and hydrogen-rich central stars of planetary nebulae. We find that [WR] central stars are closer to the Galactic plane than hydrogen-rich central stars and than other hydrogen-poor central stars. The latter have a similar distribution to hydrogen-rich central stars, which is significantly different from the one of [WR] central stars. This result disagrees with the proposed evolutionary sequence for hydrogen-poor central stars.

 We calculate the tensor bispectrum mediated by an excited scalar field during inflation and find that the bispectrum peaks in the squeezed configuration, which is different from that of gravitational waves induced by enhanced curvature perturbations re-entering the horizon in the radiation-dominated era. Measuring the bispectrum provides a promising way to distinguish the stochastic gravitational-wave background generated during inflation from that generated after inflation.

 - **Abstract**
 CRL 618 is a post-AGB star that has started to ionize its ejecta. Its central HII region has been observed over the last 40 years and has steadily increased in flux density at radio wavelengths. In this paper, we present data that we obtained with the Very Large Array in its highest frequency band (43 GHz) in 2011 and compare these with archival data in the same frequency band from 1998. By applying the so-called expansion-parallax method, we are able to estimate an expansion rate of 4.0$\pm$0.4 mas yr$^{-1}$ along the major axis of the nebula and derive a distance of 1.1$\pm$0.2 kpc. Within errors, this distance estimation is in good agreement with the value of ~900 pc derived from the expansion of the optical lobes.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine one-loop corrections from small-scale curvature perturbations to the superhorizon-limit ones in single-field inflation models, which have recently caused controversy. We consider the case where the Universe experiences transitions of slow-roll (SR) $\to$ intermediate period $\to$ SR. The intermediate period can be an ultra-slow-roll period or a resonant amplification period, either of which enhances small-scale curvature perturbations. We assume that the superhorizon curvature perturbations are conserved at least during each of the SR periods. Within this framework, we show that the superhorizon curvature perturbations during the first and the second SR periods coincide at one-loop level in the slow-roll limit.

 - **Abstract**
 Black-hole X-ray binaries exhibit different spectral and timing properties in different accretion states. The X-ray outburst of a recently discovered and extraordinarily bright source, Swift$~$J1727.8$-$1613, has enabled the first investigation of how the X-ray polarization properties of a source evolve with spectral state. The 2$-$8 keV polarization degree was previously measured by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) to be $\approx$ 4% in the hard and hard intermediate states. Here we present new IXPE results taken in the soft state, with the X-ray flux dominated by the thermal accretion-disk emission. We find that the polarization degree has dropped dramatically to $\lesssim$ 1%. This result indicates that the measured X-ray polarization is largely sensitive to the accretion state and the polarization fraction is significantly higher in the hard state when the X-ray emission is dominated by up-scattered radiation in the X-ray corona. The combined polarization measurements in the soft and hard states disfavor a very high or low inclination of the system.

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular emission is used to investigate both the physical and chemical properties of protoplanetary disks. Therefore, to accurately derive disk properties, we need a thorough understanding of the behavior of the molecular probes we rely on. Here we investigate how the molecular line emission of N$_2$H$^+$, HCO$^+$, HCN, and C$^{18}$O compare to other measured quantities in a set of 20 protoplanetary disks. Overall, we find positive correlations between multiple line fluxes and the disk dust mass and radius. We also generally find strong positive correlations between the line fluxes of different molecular species. However, some disks do show noticeable differences in the relative fluxes of N$_2$H$^+$, HCO$^+$, HCN, and C$^{18}$O. These differences occur even within a single star-forming region. This results in a potentially large range of different disk masses and chemical compositions for systems of similar age and birth environment. While we make preliminary comparisons of molecular fluxes across different star-forming regions, more complete and uniform samples are needed in the future to search for trends with birth environment or age.

 - **Abstract**
 Current imaging observations of protoplanetary disks using ALMA primarily focus on the sub-millimeter wavelength, leaving a gap in effective observational approaches for centimeter-sized dust, which is crucial to the issue of planet formation. The forthcoming SKA and ngVLA may rectify this deficiency. In this paper, we employ multi-fluid hydrodynamic numerical simulations and radiative transfer calculations to investigate the potential of SKA1-Mid, ngVLA, and SKA2 for imaging protoplanetary disks at sub-cm/cm wavelengths. We create mock images with ALMA/SKA/ngVLA at multi-wavelengths based on the hydrodynamical simulation output, and test different sensitivity and spatial resolutions. We discover that both SKA and ngVLA will serve as excellent supplements to the existing observational range of ALMA, and their high resolution enables them to image substructures in the disk's inner region ($\sim$ 5 au from the stellar). Our results indicate that SKA and ngVLA can be utilized for more extended monitoring programs in the centimeter waveband. While in the sub-centimeter range, ngVLA possesses the capability to produce high-fidelity images within shorter observation times ($\sim$ 1 hour on source time) than previous research, holding potential for future survey observations. We also discuss for the first time the potential of SKA2 for observing protoplanetary disks at a 0.7 cm wavelength.
