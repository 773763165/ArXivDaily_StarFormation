 - **Abstract**
 Future exploration efforts of the Moon, Mars and other bodies are poised to focus heavily on persistent and sustainable survey and research efforts, especially given the recent interest in a long-term sustainable human presence at the Moon. Key to these efforts is understanding a number of important processes on the lunar surface for both scientific and operational purposes. We discuss the potential value of in-situ artificial substrate witness plates, powerful tools that can supplement familiar remote sensing and sample acquisition techniques and provide a sustainable way of monitoring processes in key locations on planetary surfaces while maintaining a low environmental footprint. These tools, which we call Biscuits, can use customized materials as wide ranging as zircon-based spray coatings to metals potentially usable for surface structures, to target specific processes/questions as part of a small, passive witness plate that can be flexibly placed with respect to location and total time duration. We examine and discuss unique case studies to show how processes such as water presence/transport, presence and contamination of biologically relevant molecules, solar activity related effects, and other processes can be measured using Biscuits. Biscuits can yield key location sensitive, time integrated measurements on these processes to inform scientific understanding of the Moon and enable operational goals in lunar exploration. While we specifically demonstrate this on a simulated traverse and for selected examples, we stress all groups interested in planetary surfaces should consider these adaptable, low footprint and highly informative tools for future exploration.
#### Power-spectrum space decomposition of frequency tomographic data for  intensity mapping experiments

 - **Abstract**
 We present a Bayesian framework to establish a power-spectrum space decomposition of frequency tomographic (PSDFT) data for future intensity mapping (IM) experiments. Different from most traditional component-separation methods which work in the map domain, this new technique treats multifrequency power spectra as raw data and can reconstruct component power spectra by taking advantage of distinct components' correlation patterns in the frequency domain. We have validated this new technique for both interferometric and single-dish-like IM experiments, respectively, using synthesized mock data that contain bright foreground contaminants, IM signals, and instrumental effects at different frequencies. The PSDFT approach can effectively remove the bright foreground contamination and extract the targeted IM signals using a Bayesian approach in a power-spectrum subspace. This new approach can be directly applied to a broad range of IM analyses and will be well suited to future high-quality IM datasets, providing a powerful tool for future IM surveys.
#### A striking relationship between dust extinction and radio detection in  DESI QSOs: evidence for a dusty blow-out phase in red QSOs

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first eight months of data from our secondary target program within the ongoing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. Our program uses a mid-infrared and optical colour selection to preferentially target dust-reddened QSOs that would have otherwise been missed by the nominal DESI QSO selection. So far we have obtained optical spectra for 3038 candidates, of which ~70% of the high-quality objects (those with robust redshifts) are visually confirmed to be Type 1 QSOs, consistent with the expected fraction from the main DESI QSO survey. By fitting a dust-reddened blue QSO composite to the QSO spectra, we find they are well-fitted by a normal QSO with up to Av~4 mag of line-of-sight dust extinction. Utilizing radio data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) DR2, we identify a striking positive relationship between the amount of line-of-sight dust extinction towards a QSO and the radio detection fraction, that is not driven by radio-loud systems, redshift and/or luminosity effects. This demonstrates an intrinsic connection between dust reddening and the production of radio emission in QSOs, whereby the radio emission is most likely due to low-powered jets or winds/outflows causing shocks in a dusty environment. On the basis of this evidence we suggest that red QSOs may represent a transitional "blow-out" phase in the evolution of QSOs, where winds and outflows evacuate the dust and gas to reveal an unobscured blue QSO.
#### A Parsec-Scale Catalog of Molecular Clouds in the Solar Neighborhood  Based on 3D Dust Mapping: Implications for the Mass-Size Relation

 - **Abstract**
 We dendrogram the Leike et al. 2020 3D dust map, leveraging its $\sim 1$ pc spatial resolution to produce a uniform catalog of molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood. Using accurate distances, we measure the properties of 65 clouds in true 3D space, eliminating much of the uncertainty in mass, size, and density. Clouds in the catalog contain a total of $1.1 \times 10^5 \; \rm M_{\odot}$, span distances of $116-440$ pc, and include a dozen well-studied clouds in the literature. In addition to deriving cloud properties in 3D volume density space, we create 2D dust extinction maps from the 3D data by projecting the 3D clouds onto a 2D "Sky" view. We measure the properties of the 2D clouds separately from those of the 3D clouds. Using the 2D and 3D derived results, we compare the scaling relation between the masses and sizes of clouds following Larson 1981. We find that our 2D projected mass-size relation, $M \propto r^{2.1}$, agrees with Larson's Third Relation, but our 3D derived properties lead to a scaling relation of about one order larger: $M \propto r^{2.9}$. Validating predictions from numerical simulations and analytic theory, our results indicate that the mass-size relation is sensitive to whether column or volume density is used to define clouds, since mass scales with area in 2D space ($M \propto r^{2}$) and with volume in 3D space ($M \propto r^{3}$). Our results imply a roughly constant column and volume density for molecular clouds, as would be expected for clouds where the lower density, larger volume-filling gas dominates the cloud mass budget.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the active debates in core-collapse supernova (CCSN) theory is how significantly neutrino flavor conversions induced by neutrino-neutrino self-interactions change the conventional picture of CCSN dynamics. Recent studies have indicated that strong flavor conversions can occur inside neutrino spheres where neutrinos are tightly coupled to matter. These flavor conversions are associated with either collisional instability or fast neutrino-flavor conversion (FFC) or both. The impact of these flavor conversions on CCSN dynamics is, however, still highly uncertain due to the lack of global simulations of quantum kinetic neutrino transport with appropriate microphysical inputs. Given fluid profiles from a recent CCSN model at three different time snapshots in the early post-bounce phase, we perform global quantum kinetic simulations in spherical symmetry with an essential set of microphysics. We find that strong flavor conversions occur in optically thick regions, resulting in a substantial change of neutrino radiation field. The neutrino heating in the gain region is smaller than the case with no flavor conversions, whereas the neutrino cooling in the optically thick region is commonly enhanced. Based on the neutrino data obtained from our multi-angle neutrino transport simulations, we also assess some representative classical closure relations by applying them to diagonal components of density matrix of neutrinos. We find that Eddington tensors can be well approximated by these closure relations except for the region where flavor conversions occur vividly. We also analyze the neutrino signal by carrying out detector simulations for Super-Kamiokande, DUNE, and JUNO. We propose a useful strategy to identify the sign of flavor conversions in neutrino signal, that can be easily implemented in real data analyses of CCSN neutrinos.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will enable the search for and characterization of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres in the habitable zone via transmission spectroscopy. However, relatively little work has been done to use solar system data, where ground truth is known, to validate spectroscopic retrieval codes intended for exoplanet studies, particularly in the limit of high resolution and high signal-to-noise (S/N). In this work, we perform such a validation by analyzing a high S/N empirical transmission spectrum of Earth using a new terrestrial exoplanet atmospheric retrieval model with heritage in Solar System remote sensing and gaseous exoplanet retrievals. We fit the Earth's 2-14 um transmission spectrum in low resolution (R=250 at 5 um) and high resolution (R=100,000 at 5 um) under a variety of assumptions about the 1D vertical atmospheric structure. In the limit of noiseless transmission spectra, we find excellent agreement between model and data (deviations < 10%) that enable the robust detection of H2O, CO2, O3, CH4, N2, N2O, NO2, HNO3, CFC-11, and CFC-12 thereby providing compelling support for the detection of habitability, biosignature, and technosignature gases in the atmosphere of the planet using an exoplanet-analog transmission spectrum. Our retrievals at high spectral resolution show a marked sensitivity to the thermal structure of the atmosphere, trace gas abundances, density-dependent effects, such as collision-induced absorption and refraction, and even hint at 3D spatial effects. However, we used synthetic observations of TRAPPIST-1e to verify that the use of simple 1D vertically homogeneous atmospheric models will likely suffice for JWST observations of terrestrial exoplanets transiting M dwarfs.
#### Probing the Global 21-cm Signal via the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe Effect on  the 21-cm Background

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14808
 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel method to probe the global 21-cm background. This background experiences the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW) as the cosmic microwave background does. The 21-cm ISW is modulated by the spectral shape of the global 21-cm signal, and thus the measure of the 21-cm ISW will be a probe of the evolution of the global signal. With the phase-1 SKA telescope, probing the global 21-cm background would be feasible with 10000-hour observation, enabling consistency checks with existing measures of the global 21-cm signal by EDGES and SARAS that are conflicting with each other.
#### Punctuated chaos and the unpredictability of the Galactic center S-star  orbital evolution

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the chaotic behavior of the S-star cluster in the Galactic center using precise $N$-body calculations, free from round-off or discretization errors. Our findings reveal that chaos among the Galactic center S-stars arises from close encounters, particularly among pairs and near the massive central body. These encounters induce perturbations, causing sudden changes in the orbital energies of the interacting stars. Consequently, neighboring solutions experience roughly exponential growth in separation. We propose a theory of "punctuated chaos" that describes the S-star cluster's chaotic behavior. This phenomenon results from nearly linear growth in the separation between neighboring orbits after repeated finite perturbations. Each participating star's orbit experiences discrete, abrupt changes in energy due to the perturbations. The cumulative effect of these events is further amplified by the steady drift in orbital phase. In the Galactic center, perturbations originate from coincidental encounters occurring within a distance of $\aplt 100$\,au between at least two stars (in some cases, three stars). Our model satisfactorily explains the observed exponential growth in the 27 S-star cluster. We determine that the S-star system has a Lyapunov time scale of approximately 462 +/-74 years. For the coming millennium, chaos in the S-star cluster will be driven mainly by a few of the closest orbiting stars: S2, S5, S6, S8, S9, S14, S18, S31, S21, S24, S27, S29, and S38.
#### The SN 2023ixf Progenitor in M101: II. Properties

 - **Abstract**
 We follow our first paper with an analysis of the ensemble of the extensive pre-explosion ground- and space-based infrared observations of the red supergiant (RSG) progenitor candidate for the nearby core-collapse supernova SN 2023ixf in Messier 101, together with optical data prior to explosion obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We have confirmed the association of the progenitor candidate with the SN, as well as constrained the metallicity at the SN site, based on SN observations with instruments at Gemini-North. The internal host extinction to the SN has also been confirmed from a high-resolution Keck spectrum. We fit the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) for the star, accounting for its intrinsic variability, with dust radiative-transfer modeling, which assume a silicate-rich dust shell ahead of the underlying stellar photosphere. The star is heavily dust-obscured, likely the dustiest progenitor candidate yet encountered. We found maximum-likelihood estimates of the star's effective temperature and luminosity of 3450 K and 9.3e4 L_Sun, with 68% credible intervals of 2370--3700 K and (7.6--10.8)e4 L_sun. The candidate may have a Galactic RSG analog, IRC -10414, with a strikingly similar SED and luminosity. Via comparison with single-star evolutionary models we have constrained the initial mass of the progenitor candidate from 12 M_sun to as high as 15 M_sun. We have had available to us an extraordinary view of the SN 2023ixf progenitor candidate, which should be further followed up in future years with HST and the James Webb Space Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants (SNRs) are the best candidates for galactic cosmic ray acceleration to relativistic energies via diffusive shock acceleration. The gamma-ray emission of SNRs can provide direct evidence of leptonic (inverse Compton and bremsstrahlung) and hadronic (proton-proton interaction and subsequently pion decay) processes. Puppis A is a ~ 4 kyr old SNR interacting with interstellar clouds which has been observed in a broad energy band, from radio to gamma-ray. We performed a morphological and spectral analysis of 14 years of observations with Fermi-LAT telescope in order to study its gamma-ray emission. We found a clear asymmetry in high-energy brightness between the eastern and western sides of the remnant, reminiscent to that observed in the X-ray emission. The eastern side, interacting with a molecular cloud, shows a spectrum which can be reproduced by a pion decay model. Moreover, we analyzed two gamma-ray sources located close to the remnant. The hardness of their spectra suggests that the gamma-ray emission can be due to particles escaping from the shock of Puppis A.
#### R-Matrix calculations for opacities.II. Photoionization and oscillator  strengths of iron ions FeXVII, FeXVIII and FeXIX

 - **Abstract**
 Iron is the dominant heavy element that plays an important role in radiation transport in stellar interiors. Owing to its abundance and large number of bound levels and transitions, iron ions determine the opacity more than any other astrophysically abundant element. A few iron ions constitute the abundance and opacity of iron at the base of the convection zone (BCZ) at the boundary between the solar convection and radiative zones, and are the focus of the present study. Together, FeXVII, FeXVIII and FeXIX contribute 85\% of iron ion fractions 20\%, 39\% and 26\% respectively, at the BCZ physical conditions. We report heretofore the most extensive R-matrix atomic calculations for these ions for bound-bound and bound-free transitions, the two main processes of radiation absorption. We consider wavefunction expansions with 218 target or core ion fine structure levels of FeXVIII for FeXVII, 276 levels of FeXIX for FeXVIII, in the Breit-Pauli R-matrix (BPRM) approximation, and 180 LS terms (equivalent to 415 fine structure levels) of FeXX for FeXIX calculations. These large target expansions which includes core ion excitations to n=2,3,4 complexes enable accuracy and convergence of photoionization cross sections, as well as inclusion of high lying resonances. Photoionization cross sections have obtained for all bound fine structure levels of FeXVII and FeXVIII, and for 900 bound LS states of FeXIX. Selected results demonstrating prominent characteristic features of photoionization are presented, particularly the strong Seaton PEC (photoexcitation-of-core) resonances formed via high-lying core excitations with $\Delta n=1$ that significantly impact bound-free opacity.

 - **Abstract**
 Due to turbulence in the atmosphere images taken from ground-based telescopes become distorted. With adaptive optics (AO) images can be given greater clarity allowing for better observations with existing telescopes and are essential for ground-based coronagraphic exoplanet imaging instruments. A disadvantage to many AO systems is that they use sensors that can not correct for non-common path aberrations. We have developed a new focal plane wavefront sensing technique to address this problem called deformable mirror (DM)-based pupil chopping. The process involves a coronagraphic or non-coronagraphic science image and a deformable mirror, which modulates the phase by applying a local tip/tilt every other frame which enables correcting for leftover aberrations in the wavefront after a conventional AO correction. We validate this technique with both simulations (for coronagraphic and non-coronagraphic images) and testing (for non-coronagraphic images) on UCSC's Santa Cruz Extreme AO Laboratory (SEAL) testbed. We demonstrate that with as low as 250 nm of DM stroke to apply the local tip/tilt this wavefront sensor is linear for low-order Zernike modes and enables real-time control, in principle up to kHz speeds to correct for residual atmospheric turbulence.
#### Spherical solutions of the Schrödinger-Poisson system with core-tail  structure

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14866
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14866
 - **Abstract**
 We construct spherically symmetric equilibrium solutions of the Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) system of equations with a core-tail structure that could serve as models of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) halos. The core is assumed to be a solitonic ground state equilibrium configuration of the SP equations, and the tail is integrated from a transition radius onwards. The total mass of the system parametrizes the family of solutions and constrains the tail density profile. The tail has a radial velocity profile, whereas the core is stationary. We investigate the evolution of these equilibrium configurations and find that the tail initially perturbs the core, and consequently, the whole solution oscillates around a virialized solution that we call 'relaxed', whose average also has a core-tail structure. We measure the departure of the relaxed configuration from the equilibrium solution in order to estimate the utility of the latter. We also find that the core-halo scaling relation of equilibrium configurations has an exponent $\alpha=1/3$, whereas relaxed configurations exhibit a scaling with $\alpha=0.54$.
#### R-matrix calculations for opacities: III. Plasma broadening of  autoionizing resonances

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14870
 - **Abstract**
 A general formulation is employed to study and quantitatively ascertain the effect of plasma broadening of {\it intrinsic} autoionizing (AI) resonances in photoionization cross sections. In particular, R-matrix data for iron ions described in the previous paper in the RMOP series (RMOP-II, hereafter RMOP2) are used to demonstrate underlying physical mechanisms due to electron collisions, ion microfields (Stark), thermal Doppler effects, core excitations, and free-free transitions. Breit-Pauli R-matrix (BPRM) cross section for the large number of bound levels of Fe ions are considered, 454 levels of Fe~XVII, 1,184 levels of Fe~XVIII and 508 levels of Fe~XIX. Following a description of theoretical and computational methods, a sample of results is presented to show significant broadening and shifting of AI resonances due to {\it Extrinsic} plasma broadening as a function of temperature and density. Redistribution of AI resonance strengths broadly preserves their integrated strengths as well as the naturally {\it intrinsic} asymmetric shapes of resonance complexes which are broadened, smeared and flattened, eventually dissolving into the bound-free continua.
#### R-Matrix calculations for opacities: IV. Convergence, completeness, and  comparison of relativistic R-matrix and distorted wave calculations for  FeXVII and FeXVIII

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate the completeness of coupled channel (CC) Breit-Pauli R-Matrix (BPRM) calculations for opacities, we employ the relativistic distorted wave (RDW) method to complement (``top-up'') and compare the BPRM photoionization cross sections for high-$n\ell$ levels of both FeXVII and FeXVIII. Good agreement is found in background photoionization cross sections using these two methods, which also ensures correct matching of bound level cross sections for completeness. In order to top-up the CC-BPRM calculations, bound-bound transitions involving additional bound levels, and a large number of doubly-excited quasi-bound levels corresponding to BPRM autoionizing resonances described in paper RMOPII, are calculated using the RDW method. Photoionization cross sections in the high energy region are also computed and compared up to about 500 $Ry$, and contributions from higher core level excitations than BPRM are considered. The effect of configuration interaction is investigated, which plays a significant role in correctly reproducing some background cross sections. Owing to the fact that the additional RDW levels correspond to high-$n\ell$ bound levels that are negligibly populated according to the Mihalas-Hummer-D\"{a}ppen equation-of-state (Paper I), the effect on opacities is expected to be small.

 - **Abstract**
 An extended version of the R-matrix methodology is presented for calculation of radiative parameters for improved plasma opacities. Contrast and comparisons with existing methods primarily relying on the Distorted Wave (DW) approximation are discussed to verify accuracy and resolve outstanding issues, particularly with reference to the Opacity Project (OP). Among the improvements incorporated are: (i) large-scale Breit-Pauli R-matrix (BPRM) calculations for complex atomic systems including fine structure, (ii) convergent close coupling wave function expansions for the (e+ion) system to compute oscillator strengths and photoionization cross sections, (iii) open and closed shell iron ions of interest in astrophysics and experiments, (iv) a treatment for plasma broadening of autoionizing resonances as function of energy-temperature-density dependent cross sections, (v) a "top-up" procedure to compare convergence with R-matrix calculations for highly excited levels, and (vi) spectroscopic identification of resonances and bound \eion levels. The present R-matrix monochromatic opacity spectra are fundamentally different from OP and lead to enhanced Rosseland and Planck mean opacities. An outline of the work reported in other papers in this series and those in progress is presented. Based on the present re-examination of the OP work, it is evident that opacities of heavy elements require revisions in high temperature-density plasma sources.
#### Buoyancy response of a disk to an embedded planet: a cross-code  comparison at high resolution

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14896
 - **Abstract**
 In radiatively inefficient, laminar protoplanetary disks, embedded planets can excite a buoyancy response as gas gets deflected vertically near the planet. This results in vertical oscillations that drive a vortensity growth in the planet's corotating region, speeding up inward migration in the type-I regime. We present a comparison between PLUTO/IDEFIX and FARGO3D using 3D, inviscid, adiabatic numerical simulations of planet-disk interaction that feature the buoyancy response of the disk, and show that PLUTO/IDEFIX struggle to resolve higher-order modes of the buoyancy-related oscillations, weakening vortensity growth and the associated torque. We interpret this as a drawback of total-energy-conserving, finite-volume schemes. Our results indicate that a very high resolution or high-order scheme is required in shock-capturing codes in order to adequately capture this effect.
#### The Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background from Primordial Black Holes  in R-Symmetric $SU(5)$ Inflation

 - **Abstract**
 This study explores the realization of nonminimally coupled Higgs inflation in the context of no-scale supergravity, investigates the formation of primordial black holes, and examines the potential for observable proton decay within the framework of the R-symmetric $SU(5)$ model. For inflation, both single and multifield scenarios are investigated. The prediction of the single-field model for the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, is approximately $10^{-3}$, and the scalar spectral index falls within Plank's 1$\sigma$ range. The running of the scalar spectral index, $-{dn_{s}}/{d\ln{k}}$, is approximately $10^{-4}$. A realistic scenario of reheating and non-thermal leptogenesis is employed with reheat temperature $T_r\sim10^9$ GeV. In the multifield case, we mainly focus on Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and Gravitational Waves (GWs). In this inflationary framework, we demonstrate how a suitable choice of parameters can result in an enhanced scalar power spectrum, leading to the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) capable of fully accounting for dark matter. We also show that this scenario leads to Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGW) which can be detected in current and future GW detectors. We explore different proton decay channels to look for observable predictions for the next-generation proton decay experiments Hyper-K and DUNE consistent with gauge coupling unification and cosmological bounds.

 - **Abstract**
 We present multi-wavelength observations by Chandrayaan-2/XSM, SDO/AIA and Hinode/XRT of a B-class flare observed on 25th February, 2021, originating from an active region (AR 12804) near the North-West limb. The microflare lasts for approx 30 mins and is composed of hot loops reaching temperatures of 10 MK. We report excellent agreement (within 20 percent) for the average effective temperatures obtained at the flare peak from all the three instruments, which have different temperature sensitivities. The XRT filter combination of Be-thin and Be-med provides an excellent opportunity to measure the high-temperatures in such microflare events. The elemental abundances during the evolution of the microflare are also studied and observed to drop towards photospheric values at the flare peak time, compared to coronal values during the rise and decay phase. This is consistent with previous XSM studies.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate how the complex structure found in solar wind proton velocity distribution functions (VDFs), rather than the commonly assumed two-component bi-Maxwellian structure, affects the onset and evolution of parallel-propagating microinstabilities. We use the Arbitrary Linear Plasma Solver (ALPS), a numerical dispersion solver, to find the real frequencies and growth/damping rates of the Alfv\'en modes calculated for proton VDFs extracted from Wind spacecraft observations of the solar wind. We compare this wave behavior to that obtained by applying the same procedure to core-and-beam bi-Maxwellian fits of the Wind proton VDFs. We find several significant differences in the plasma waves obtained for the extracted data and bi-Maxwellian fits, including a strong dependence of the growth/damping rate on the shape of the VDF. By application of the quasilinear diffusion operator to these VDFs, we pinpoint resonantly interacting regions in velocity space where differences in VDF structure significantly affect the wave growth and damping rates. This demonstration of the sensitive dependence of Alfv\'en mode behavior on VDF structure may explain why the Alfv\'en ion-cyclotron instability thresholds predicted by linear theory for bi-Maxwellian models of solar wind proton background VDFs do not entirely constrain spacecraft observations of solar wind proton VDFs, such as those made by the Wind spacecraft.

 Neural networks as well as other methods of machine learning (ML) are known to be highly efficient in different classification tasks, including classification of images and videos. Mini- EUSO is a wide-field-of-view imaging telescope that operates onboard the International Space Station since 2019 collecting data on miscellaneous processes that take place in the atmosphere of Earth in the UV range. Here we briefly present our results on the development of ML-based approaches for recognition and classification of track-like signals in the Mini-EUSO data, among them meteors, space debris and signals the light curves and kinematics of which are similar to those expected from extensive air showers generated by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. We show that even simple neural networks demonstrate impressive performance in solving these tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we propose a new light-curve model for Type-IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) with an approximation of medium recombination. Recombination of hydrogen that takes place in the envelope is believed highly affect the light curves of SNe IIP. The propagation of the recombination wave through the expanding envelope is crucial to determine the temperature and the bolometric luminosity. Several approximations were made in previous works to determine the recombination front, which plays a role as the pseudo-photosphere. With the Eddington boundary condition, we let the actual photosphere be the boundary to determine the time evolution of temperature profile of the envelope and calculate the bolometric luminosity. A new approximation on the speed of recombination wave is introduced to get a closer result to the real situation. We abandon the non-self-consistent approximations made in former works and solve the initial hump problem in the previous attempt for the slow recombination approximation. The produced light curves show the necessity of this approximation and fit the observation well.

 - **Abstract**
 Over 60 years after the discovery of the first quasar, more than $275$ such sources are identified in the epoch of reionization at $z>6$. JWST is now exploring higher redshifts ($z\gtrsim 8$) and lower mass ($\lesssim 10^7 M_\odot$) ranges. The discovery of progressively farther quasars is instrumental to constraining the properties of the first population of black holes (BHs), or BH seeds, formed at $z \sim 20-30$. For the first time, we use Bayesian analysis of the most comprehensive catalog of quasars at $z>6$ to constrain the distribution of BH seeds. We demonstrate that the mass distribution of BH seeds can be effectively described by combining a power law and a lognormal function tailored to the mass ranges associated with light and heavy seeds. The inferred values of the Eddington ratio, the duty cycle, and the mean radiative efficiency are $0.82^{+0.10}_{-0.10}$, $0.66^{+0.23}_{-0.23}$, and $0.06^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$, respectively. In summary, the population of BHs that formed the detected quasars accreted, on average, at $\sim 80\%$ Eddington for $\sim2/3$ of the available time. Our analysis reveals a power-law slope of $-0.70^{+0.46}_{-0.46}$ and a lognormal mean of $4.44^{+0.30}_{-0.30}$. Models that solely incorporate a power law or a lognormal distribution within the specific mass range corresponding to light and heavy seeds are statistically strongly disfavored. Our results suggest that including both components is necessary to comprehensively account for the masses of high-redshift quasars. Hence, we argue that both light and heavy seeds formed in the early Universe and grew to form the population of quasars we observe.

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical investigations into the deflection angle caused by microlenses offer a direct path to uncovering principles of the cosmological microlensing effect. This work specifically concentrates on the the probability density function (PDF) of the light deflection angle induced by microlenses. We have made several significant improvements to the widely used formula from Katz et al. First, we update the coefficient from 3.05 to 1.454, resulting in a better fit between the theoretical PDF and our simulation results. Second, we developed an elegant fitting formula for the PDF that can replace its integral representation within a certain accuracy, which is numerically divergent unless arbitrary upper limits are chosen. Third, to facilitate further theoretical work in this area, we have identified a more suitable Gaussian approximation for the fitting formula.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the set of conditions that allow rocky planets to have liquid water on their surface -- in the form of lakes, seas or oceans -- is a major scientific step to determine the fraction of planets potentially suitable for the emergence and development of life as we know it on Earth. This effort is also necessary to define and refine the so-called "Habitable Zone" (HZ) in order to guide the search for exoplanets likely to harbor remotely detectable life forms. Until now, most numerical climate studies on this topic have focused on the conditions necessary to maintain oceans, but not to form them in the first place. Here we use the three-dimensional Generic Planetary Climate Model (PCM), historically known as the LMD Generic Global Climate Model (GCM), to simulate water-dominated planetary atmospheres around different types of Main-Sequence stars. The simulations are designed to reproduce the conditions of early ocean formation on rocky planets due to the condensation of the primordial water reservoir at the end of the magma ocean phase. We show that the incoming stellar radiation (ISR) required to form oceans by condensation is always drastically lower than that required to vaporize oceans. We introduce a Water Condensation Limit, which lies at significantly lower ISR than the inner edge of the HZ calculated with three-dimensional numerical climate simulations. This difference is due to a behavior change of water clouds, from low-altitude dayside convective clouds to high-altitude nightside stratospheric clouds. Finally, we calculated transit spectra, emission spectra and thermal phase curves of TRAPPIST-1b, c and d with H2O-rich atmospheres, and compared them to CO2 atmospheres and bare rock simulations. We show using these observables that JWST has the capability to probe steam atmospheres on low-mass planets, and could possibly test the existence of nightside water clouds.
#### Close-in ice lines and the super-stellar C/O ratio in discs around very  low-mass stars

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the elevated C/O ratios in discs around late M dwarfs compared to discs around solar-type stars is not well understood. Here we endeavour to reproduce the observed differences in the disc C/O ratios as a function of stellar mass using a viscosity-driven disc evolution model and study the corresponding atmospheric composition of planets that grow inside the water-ice line in these discs. We carried out simulations using a coupled disc evolution and planet formation code that includes pebble drift and evaporation. We used a chemical partitioning model for the dust composition in the disc midplane. Inside the water-ice line, the disc's C/O ratio initially decreases to sub-stellar due to the inward drift and evaporation of water-ice-rich pebbles before increasing again to super-stellar values due to the inward diffusion of carbon-rich vapour. We show that this process is more efficient for very low-mass stars compared to solar-type stars due to the closer-in ice lines and shorter disc viscous timescales. In high-viscosity discs, the transition from sub-stellar to super-stellar takes place faster due to the fast inward advection of carbon-rich gas. Our results suggest that planets accreting their atmospheres early (when the disc C/O is still sub-stellar) will have low atmospheric C/O ratios, while planets that accrete their atmospheres late (when the disc C/O has become super-stellar) can obtain high C/O ratios. Our model predictions are consistent with observations, under the assumption that all stars have the same metallicity and chemical composition, and that the vertical mixing timescales in the inner disc are much shorter than the radial advection timescales. This further strengthens the case for considering stellar abundances alongside disc evolution in future studies that aim to link planet (atmospheric) composition to disc composition.

 - **Abstract**
 Some of the accreting X-ray pulsars are reported to exhibit a peculiar spectral feature at $\sim$10 keV, known as the "10 keV feature". The feature has been characterized as either an emission line or an absorption line, and its origin is unknown. It has been found in multiple observations of the same source by different observatories, but not all the observations of any particular source consistently showed the presence of it. In this work, we have carried out a systematic investigation for the presence of the "10 keV feature" using data from NuSTAR, a low background spectroscopic observatory having uninterrupted wide band coverage on either side of 10 keV. We performed a systematic spectral analysis on 58 archival NuSTAR observations of 30 bright X-ray pulsars. The 3$-$79 keV spectral continua of these selected sources were fitted with a model chosen on the basis of its fitting quality in 3$-$15 keV and model simplicity, and then inspected for the presence of the "10 keV feature". Our analysis indicates the presence of such a feature in 16 out of 58 the NuSTAR observations of 11 different sources and is fitted with a Gaussian absorption model centered around 10 keV. Our analysis also suggests that such a feature could be wrongly detected if flare data is not analyzed separately from persistent emission.

 - **Abstract**
 A novel 3-D calorimeter, composed of about 7500 LYSO cubes, is the key and crucial detector of the High Energy cosmic-Radiation Detection (HERD) facility to be installed onboard the China Space Station. Energy deposition from cosmic ray in each LYSO cube is translated by multiple wavelength shifting (WLS) fibers for multi-range data acquisition and real-time triggering. In this study, various methods of surface finish and encapsulation of the LYSO cube were investigated to optimize the amplitude from the WLS fiber end with the aim of improving the signal-to-noise ratio of Intensified scientific CMOS (IsCMOS) collection. The LYSO cube with five rough surfaces and a specular reflector achieves the maximum amplitude at the low-range fiber end, which is increased by roughly 44% compared to the polished cube with PTFE wrapping. The non-uniformity of amplitude at different positions on the LYSO cube surface was measured by X-ray and the positional correlation factor was derived for the entire cube. A simulation based on HERD CALO was conducted, which revealed that both the LYSO cube with five rough surfaces and the cube with rough bottom face exhibit superior energy resolution for electrons compared to the other two configurations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a summary of the flavor composition measurements for the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux using data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole. IceCube has identified candidate astrophysical tau neutrinos through two different approaches. One approach used a dedicated particle identification algorithm for the classification and reconstruction of the 'Double Cascade' event topology, a signature of tau neutrino charged current interactions. This first approach is applied to the High Energy Starting Events (HESE) sample, an all-sky, all-flavor set of neutrino events with energy above 60~TeV encompassing 12 years of IceCube livetime. We show that the addition of more years of data and updated ice properties on the HESE sample delivers tighter constraints on the flavor composition of the astrophysical neutrino flux than previous IceCube analyses, in particular when it is fit in combination with high statistics samples of through-going tracks and cascades. A second approach uses a sensitive machine-learning-based selection technique that finds seven candidate events in 9.7 years of IceCube data. This approach excludes the zero astrophysical tau neutrino hypothesis at the highest statistical significance to date.

 - **Abstract**
 The observation of an astrophysical neutrino flux in IceCube and its detection capability to separate between the different neutrino flavors has led IceCube to constraint the flavor content of this flux. IceCube-Gen2 is the planned extension of the current IceCube detector, which will be about 8 times larger than the current instrumented volume. In this work, we study the sensitivity of IceCube-Gen2 to the astrophysical neutrino flavor composition and investigate its tau neutrino identification capabilities. We apply the IceCube analysis on a simulated IceCube-Gen2 dataset that mimics the High Energy Starting Event (HESE) classification. Reconstructions are performed using sensors that have 3 times higher quantum efficiency and isotropic angular acceptance compared to the current IceCube optical modules. We present the projected sensitivity for 10 years of data on constraining the flavor ratio of the astrophysical neutrino flux at Earth by IceCube-Gen2.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the low Galactic latitude ($b=4.3^\circ$) quasar 2005$+$403, the second active galactic nuclei, in which we detected a rare phenomenon of multiple imaging induced by refractive-dominated scattering. The manifestation of this propagation effect is revealed at different frequencies ($\lesssim8$ GHz) and epochs of VLBA observations. The pattern formed by anisotropic scattering is stretched out along the line of constant Galactic latitude with a local $\mathrm{PA}\approx40^\circ$ showing one-two sub-images, often on either side of the core. Analysing the multi-frequency VLBA data ranging from 1.4 to 43.2 GHz, we found that both the angular size of the apparent core component and the separation between the primary and secondary core images follow a $\lambda^2$ dependence, providing convincing evidence for a plasma scattering origin for the multiple imaging. Based on the OVRO long-term monitoring data at 15 GHz obtained for 2005$+$403, we identified the characteristic flux density excursions occurred in April-May 2019 and attributed to an extreme scattering event (ESE) associated with the passage of a plasma lens across the line of sight. Modeling the ESE, we determined that the angular size of the screen is 0.4 mas and it drifts with the proper motion of 4.4 mas yr$^{-1}$. Assuming that the scattering screen is located in the highly turbulent Cygnus region, the transverse linear size and speed of the lens with respect to the observer are 0.7 AU and 37 km s$^{-1}$, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 The pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have recently suggested the presence of a gravitational wave background at nano-Hertz frequencies. In this paper, we explore potential inflationary interpretation of this signal within the context of a simple and health parity-violating gravity model termed the Nieh-Yan modified Teleparallel Gravity. Through this model, two inflationary scenarios are evaluated, both yielding significant polarized primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) that align well with the results from PTA observations. Furthermore, the resulting PGWs can display strong circular polarization and significant anisotropies in the PTA frequency band, which are distinct features to be verified by observations of both PTA and the cosmic microwave background.The detection of such a distinctive background of PGWs is expected to provide strong evidence supporting our scenarios and insights into inflationary dynamics and gravity theory.

 In this paper we will introduce the Terzina instrument, which is one of the two scientific payloads of the NUSES satellite mission. NUSES serves as a technological pathfinder, hosting a suite of innovative instruments designed for the in-orbit detection of cosmic rays, neutrinos, and gamma rays across various energy ranges. The Terzina instrument itself is a compact telescope equipped with Schmidt-Cassegrain optics. Its primary objective is to detect Cherenkov radiation emitted by Extensive Air Showers generated by the interaction of high-energy (> 100 PeV) cosmic rays with the Earth's atmosphere. Terzina represents a critical step forward in the development of future space-based instruments aimed at detecting upward-moving showers induced by tau-leptons and muons resulting from the interaction of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos with the Earth. In this paper, we will delve into the key technical aspects of the Terzina instrument, its capabilities, and its potential for detection.

 - **Abstract**
 The equation of state (EOS) is a key ingredient for understanding the structure and composition of neutron stars (NSs). Observation of several pulsars with masses $\approx$ 2 Msun, inference of tidal deformabilities from gravitational waves signals in binary neutron stars mergers and joint mass and radius estimates of two millisecond pulsars contributed to better constraining the behavior of NS EOS beyond the nuclear saturation density. We aim to build families of EOSs subjected to various minimal sets of constraints and identify the role some of these constraints play. We also aim to establish correlations between properties of nuclear matter (NM) and properties of NSs. The non-relativistic mean field theory of NM and the standard Skyrme parametrization of the nucleonic effective interactions are used to generate, within a Bayesian framework, models of EOSs. The constraints we pose come from empirical parameters of NM, ab initio calculations of pure neutron matter (PNM) and the 2 Msun lower limit on the maximum NS mass. EOSs also have to be causal. A purely nucleonic composition is hypothesized. EOSs are generated and investigated for five sets of constraints. Marginalized posteriors of the effective interaction's parameters; empirical parameters of NM; selected global properties of NSs are plotted and analyzed. Correlations among parameters in the isoscalar and isovector channels as well as with NS properties are studied. EOSs of NM and NSs are very sensitive to the set of constraints, including whether correlations among the values that the energy per nucleon in PNM takes at different densities are accounted for. In each of the five sets that we have generated there is a significant number of models that comply at 50\% credible region with joint mass and radius constraints from PSR J0030+045 and J0740+6620, while a tension exists with similar data from the NS in HESS J1731--34.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the APOSTLE suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of the Local Group to examine the high speed tail of the local dark matter velocity distribution in simulated Milky Way analogues. The velocity distribution in the Solar neighborhood is well approximated by a generalized Maxwellian distribution sharply truncated at a well-defined maximum ``escape" speed. The truncated generalized Maxwellian distribution accurately models the local dark matter velocity distribution of all our Milky Way analogues, with no evidence for any separate extragalactic high-speed components. The local maximum speed is well approximated by the terminal velocity expected for particles able to reach the Solar neighborhood in a Hubble time from the farthest confines of the Local Group. This timing constraint means that the local dark matter velocity distribution is unlikely to contain any high-speed particles contributed by the Virgo Supercluster ``envelope", as argued in recent works. Particles in the Solar neighborhood with speeds close to the local maximum speed can reach well outside the virial radius of the Galaxy, and, in that sense, belong to the Local Group envelope posited in earlier work. The local manifestation of such envelope is thus not a distinct high-speed component, but rather simply the high-speed tail of the truncated Maxwellian distribution.
