 - **Abstract**
 This work aims at characterizing the mid-IR spectra of formamide in its pure form as well as in mixtures of the most abundant interstellar ices via laboratory simulation of such ices, as well as demonstrating how these laboratory spectra can be used to search for formamide in ice observations. Mid-IR spectra (4000 - 500 cm$^{-1}$, 2.5 - 20 $\mu$m) of formamide, both in its pure form as well as in binary and tertiary mixtures with H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, NH$_3$, CH$_3$OH, H$_2$O:CO$_2$, H$_2$O:NH$_3$, CO:NH$_3$, and CO:CH$_3$OH, are collected at temperatures ranging from 15 - 212 K. Apparent band strengths and positions of eight IR bands of pure amorphous and crystalline formamide at various temperatures are provided. Three bands are identified as potential formamide tracers in observational ice spectra: the overlapping C=O stretch and NH$_2$ scissor bands at 1700.3 and 1630.4 cm$^{-1}$ (5.881 and 6.133 $\mu$m), the CH bend at 1388.1 cm$^{-1}$ (7.204 $\mu$m), and the CN stretch at 1328.1 cm$^{-1}$ (7.529 $\mu$m). The relative apparent band strengths, positions, and FWHM of these features in mixtures at various temperatures are also determined. Finally, the laboratory spectra are compared to observational spectra of low- and high-mass young stellar objects as well as pre-stellar cores observed with the Infrared Space Observatory, the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the JWST. A comparison between the formamide CH bend in laboratory data and the 7.24 $\mu$m band in the observations tentatively indicates that, if formamide ice is contributing significantly to the observed absorption, it is more likely in a polar matrix. Upper limits ranging from 0.35-5.1\% with respect to H$_{2}$O are calculated. These upper limits are in agreement with gas-phase formamide abundances and take into account the effect of a H$_{2}$O matrix on formamide's band strengths.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first results of the \textsc{Dragon-II} simulations, a suite of 19 $N$-body simulations of star clusters with up to $10^6$ stars, with up to $33\%$ of them initially paired in binaries. In this work, we describe the main evolution of the clusters and their compact objects (COs). All \textsc{Dragon-II} clusters form in their centre a black hole (BH) subsystem with a density $10-100$ times larger than the stellar density, with the cluster core containing $50-80\%$ of the whole BH population. In all models, the BH average mass steeply decreases as a consequence of BH burning, reaching values $\langle m_{\rm BH}\rangle < 15$ M$_\odot$ within $10-30$ relaxation times. Generally, our clusters retain only BHs lighter than $30$ M$_\odot$ over $30$ relaxation times. Looser clusters retain a higher binary fraction, because in such environments binaries are less likely disrupted by dynamical encounters. We find that BH-main sequence star binaries have properties similar to recently observed systems. Double CO binaries (DCOBs) ejected from the cluster exhibit larger mass ratios and heavier primary masses than ejected binaries hosting a single CO (SCOBs). Ejected SCOBs have BH masses $m_{\rm BH} = 3-20$ M$_\odot$, definitely lower than those in DCOBs ($m_{\rm BH} = 10-100$ M$_\odot$).
#### The Great Dimming of the hypergiant star RW Cephei: CHARA Array images  and spectral analysis

 - **Abstract**
 The cool hypergiant star RW Cephei is currently in a deep photometric minimum that began several years ago. This event bears a strong similarity to the Great Dimming of the red supergiant Betelgeuse that occurred in 2019-2020. We present the first resolved images of RW Cephei that we obtained with the CHARA Array interferometer. The angular diameter and Gaia distance estimates indicate a stellar radius of 900 - 1760 R_sun which makes RW Cep one of the largest stars known in the Milky Way. The reconstructed, near-infrared images show a striking asymmetry in the disk illumination with a bright patch offset from center and a darker zone to the west. The imaging results depend on assumptions made about the extended flux, and we present two cases with and without allowing extended emission. We also present a recent near-infrared spectrum of RW Cep that demonstrates that the fading is much larger at visual wavelengths compared to that at near-infrared wavelengths as expected for extinction by dust. We suggest that the star's dimming is the result of a recent surface mass ejection event that created a dust cloud that now partially blocks the stellar photosphere.
#### Modelling the effect of 3D temperature and chemistry on the  cross-correlation signal of transiting ultra-hot Jupiters: A study of 5  chemical species on WASP-76b

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-hot Jupiters are perfect targets for transmission spectroscopy. However, their atmospheres feature strong spatial variations in temperature, chemistry, dynamics, cloud coverage, and scale height. This makes transit observations at high spectral resolution challenging to interpret. In this work, we model the cross-correlation signal of five chemical species (Fe, CO, H$_\text{2}$O, OH, and TiO) on WASP-76b, a benchmark ultra-hot Jupiter. We compute phase-dependent high-resolution transmission spectra of 3D SPARC/MITgcm models. The spectra are obtained with gCMCRT, a 3D Monte-Carlo radiative-transfer code. We find that, on top of atmospheric dynamics, the phase-dependent Doppler shift of the absorption lines in the planetary rest frame is shaped by the combined effect of planetary rotation and the unique 3D spatial distribution of chemical species. For species probing the dayside (e.g., refractories or molecules like CO and OH), the two effects act in tandem, leading to increasing blueshifts with orbital phase. For species that are depleted on the dayside (e.g., H$_\text{2}$O and TiO), the two effects act in an opposite manner, and could lead to increasing redshifts during the transit. This behaviour yields species-dependent offsets from a planet's expected $K_\text{p}$ value that can be much larger than planetary wind speeds. The offsets are usually negative for refractory species. We provide an analytical formula to estimate the size of a planet's $K_\text{p}$ offsets, which can serve as a prior for atmospheric retrievals. We conclude that observing the phase-resolved absorption signal of multiple species is key to constraining the 3D thermochemical structure and dynamics of ultra-hot Jupiters.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the formation of the TRAPPIST-1 (T1) planets starting shortly after Moon-sized bodies form just exterior to the ice line. Our model includes mass growth from pebble accretion and mergers, fragmentation, type-I migration, and eccentricity and inclination dampening from gas drag. We follow the composition evolution of the planets fed by a dust condensation code that tracks how various dust species condense out of the disc as it cools. We use the final planet compositions to calculate the resulting radii of the planets using a new planet interior structure code and explore various interior structure models. Our model reproduces the broader architecture of the T1 system and constrains the initial water mass fraction of the early embryos and the final relative abundances of the major refractory elements. We find that the inner two planets likely experienced giant impacts and fragments from collisions between planetary embryos often seed the small planets that subsequently grow through pebble accretion. Using our composition constraints we find solutions for a two-layer model, a planet comprised of only a core and mantle, that match observed bulk densities for the two inner planets b and c. This, along with the high number of giant impacts the inner planets experienced, is consistent with recent observations that these planets are likely dessicated. However, two-layer models seem unlikely for most of the remaining outer planets which suggests that these planets have a primordial hydrosphere. Our composition constraints also indicate that no planets are consistent with a core-free interior structure.
#### A helium nova in the Large Magellanic Cloud -- the faint supersoft X-ray  source [HP99]159

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a helium nova model for the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) supersoft X-ray source (SSS) [HP99]159. This object has long been detected as a faint and persistent SSS for about 30 years, and recently been interpreted to be a source of steady helium-shell burning, because no hydrogen lines are observed. We find that the object can also be interpreted as in a decaying phase of a helium nova. The helium nova is slowly decaying toward the quiescent phase, during which the observed temperature, luminosity, and SSS lifetime ($\gtrsim 30$ years) are consistent with a massive white dwarf model of $\sim$ 1.2 $M_\odot$. If it is the case, this is the second discovery of a helium nova outburst after V445 Pup in our Galaxy and also the first identified helium nova in the LMC. We also discuss the nature of the companion helium star in relation to Type Ia supernova progenitors.
#### Clumping and X-Rays in cooler B supergiant stars

 - **Abstract**
 B supergiants (BSGs) are evolved stars with effective temperatures between 10 to 30 kK and are important to understand massive star evolution. Located on the edge of the line-driven wind regime, the study of their atmospheres is helpful to understand phenomena such as the bi-stability jump. Key UV features of their spectra have so far not been reproduced by models for types later than B1. Here, we aim to remedy this situation via spectral analysis that accounts for wind clumping and X-rays. In addition, we investigate the evolutionary status of our sample stars based on the obtained stellar parameters. We determined parameters via quantitative spectroscopy using CMFGEN and PoWR codes. The models were compared to UV and optical data of four BSGs: HD206165, HD198478, HD53138, and HD164353. We also study the evolutionary status of our sample using GENEC and MESA tracks. When including clumping and X-rays, we find good agreements between synthetic and observed spectra for our sample stars. For the first time, we reproduced key lines in the UV. For that, we require a moderately clumped wind (f_infty > ~0.5). We also infer relative X-ray luminosities of ~10^-7.5 to 10^-8 -- lower than the typical ratio of 10^-7. Moreover, we find a possible mismatch between evolutionary and spectroscopic masses, which could be related to the mass-discrepancy problem present in other OB stars. Our results provide evidence that X-rays and clumping are needed to describe the winds of cool BSGs. However, their winds seem less structured than in earlier type stars. This aligns with observational X-rays and clumping constraints as well as recent hydrodynamical simulations. The BSGs' evolutionary status appears diverse: some objects are potentially post-red supergiants or merger products. The wind parameters provide evidence for a moderate mass-loss rate increase around the bi-stability jump. Abstract abridged
