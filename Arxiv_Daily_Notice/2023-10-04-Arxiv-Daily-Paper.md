 - **Abstract**
 We apply for the first time the Monte Carlo star cluster modeling method to study tidal tail and stellar stream formation from globular clusters, assuming a circular orbit in a smooth Galactic potential. Approximating energetically unbound bodies (potential escapers; PEs) as collisionless enables this fast but spherically symmetric method to capture asymmetric tidal phenomena with unprecedented detail. Beyond reproducing known stream features, including epicyclic overdensities, we show how 'returning tidal tails' may form after the stream fully circumnavigates the Galaxy back to the cluster, enhancing the stream's velocity dispersion. While a realistically clumpy, time-dependent Galactic potential may disrupt such tails, they warrant scrutiny as potentially excellent constraints on the Galactic potential's history and substructure. Re-examining the escape timescale $\Delta t$ of PEs, we find new behavior related to chaotic scattering in the three-body problem; the $\Delta t$ distribution features sharp plateaus corresponding to distinct locally smooth patches of the chaotic saddle separating the phase space basins of escape. We study for the first time $\Delta t$ in an evolving cluster, finding that $\Delta t\sim(E_{\rm J}^{-0.1},E_{\rm J}^{-0.4})$ for PEs with (low, high) Jacobi energy $E_{\rm J}$, flatter than for a static cluster ($E_{\rm J}^{-2}$). Accounting for cluster mass loss and internal evolution -- and (roughly) for ongoing relaxation among PEs -- lowers the median $\Delta t$ from ${\sim}10\,$Gyr to ${\lesssim}100\,$Myr. We finally outline future improvements to escape physics in the Monte Carlo method intended to enable both the first large-parameter-space studies of tidal tail/stellar stream formation from full globular cluster simulations and detailed comparisons to stream observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct gas and dust hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary discs with one and two embedded planets to determine the impact that a second planet located further out in the disc has on the potential for subsequent planet formation in the region locally exterior to the inner planet. We show how the presence of a second planet has a strong influence on the collection of solid material near the inner planet, particularly when the outer planet is massive enough to generate a maximum in the disc's pressure profile. This effect in general acts to reduce the amount of material that can collect in a pressure bump generated by the inner planet. When viewing the inner pressure bump as a location for potential subsequent planet formation of a third planet, we therefore expect that the mass of such a planet will be smaller than it would be in the case without the outer planet, resulting in a small planet being sandwiched between its neighbours - this is in contrast to the expected trend of increasing planet mass with radial distance from the host star. We show that several planetary systems have been observed that do not show this trend but instead have a smaller planet sandwiched in between two more massive planets. We present the idea that such an architecture could be the result of the subsequent formation of a middle planet after its two neighbours formed at some earlier stage.
#### First constraints on Non-minimally coupled Natural and Coleman-Weinberg  inflation in the light of massive neutrino self-interactions and  Planck+BICEP/Keck

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, for the first time in literature, we compare the predictions of non-minimally coupled Natural and Coleman-Weinberg potentials in the $n_s-r$ plane against the constraints from the latest cosmological data in an extended $\Lambda$CDM model where we include non-standard self-interactions among massive neutrinos, mediated by a heavy scalar or vector boson. For the inflationary potentials, we consider two different formulations in gravity that are non-minimally coupled to the scalar field of the inflaton: \textit{Metric and Palatini.} We only consider the self-interaction to be present among $\tau$-neutrinos and only at moderate strengths. This is because strong interactions among $\tau$-neutrinos, or any strength self-interaction among electron- and muon-neutrinos, as well as any strength flavor-universal interactions, are strongly disfavoured from particle physics experiments. In terms of cosmological data, we use the latest public CMB datasets from Planck and BICEP/Keck collaborations, along with other data from CMB lensing, BAO, RSD, and SNe Ia luminosity distance measurements. We find that there are some situations where predictions from the inflationary models are ruled out at more than 2$\sigma$ by the minimal $\Lambda$CDM$+r$ model, but they are allowed in the self-interacting neutrino scenario.
#### Cluster Ages to Reconstruct the Milky Way Assembly (CARMA) I. The final  word on the origin of NGC6388 and NGC6441

 - **Abstract**
 We present CARMA, the Cluster Ages to Reconstruct the Milky Way Assembly project, that aims at determining precise and accurate age measurements for the entire system of known Galactic globular clusters and at using them to trace the most significant merger events experienced by the Milky Way. The strength of CARMA relies on the use of homogeneous photometry, theoretical isochrones, and statistical methods, that will enable to define a systematic-free chronological scale for the complete sample of Milky Way globulars. In this paper we describe the CARMA framework in detail, and present a first application on a sample of six metal-rich globular clusters with the aim of putting the final word on the debated origin of NGC6388 and NGC6441. Our results demonstrate that this pair of clusters is coeval with other four systems having a clear in-situ origin. Moreover, their location in the age-metallicity plane matches the one occupied by in-situ field stars. Such an accurate age comparison enabled by the CARMA methodology rules out the possibility that NGC6388 and NGC6441 have been accreted as part of a past merger event.
#### Considering the Single and Binary Origins of the Type IIP SN 2017eaw

 - **Abstract**
 Current population synthesis modeling suggests that 30-50% of Type II supernovae originate from binary progenitors, however, the identification of a binary progenitor is challenging. One indicator of a binary progenitor is that the surrounding stellar population is too old to contain a massive single star.Measurements of the progenitor mass of SN 2017eaw are starkly divided between observations made temporally close to core-collapse which show a progenitor mass of 13-15 solar masses (final helium core mass of 4.4 to 6.0 solar masses - which is a more informative property than initial mass) and those from the stellar population surrounding the SN which find M<10.8 solar masses (helium core mass <3.4 solar masses). In this paper, we reanalyze the surrounding stellar population with improved astrometry and photometry, finding a median age of 16.8 (+3.2, -1.0) Myr for all stars younger than 50 Myr (helium core mass of 4.7 solar masses) and 85.9 (+3.2, -6.5) Myr for stars younger than 150 Myr. 16.8 Myr is now consistent with the helium core mass range derived from the temporally near explosion observations for single stars. Applying the combined constraints to population synthesis models, we determine that the probability of the progenitor of SN 2017eaw being an initially single-star is 65% compared to 35% for prior binary interaction. 85.9 Myr is inconsistent with any formation scenarios. We demonstrate that combining progenitor age constraints with helium core mass estimates from red supergiant SED modeling, late-time spectra, and indirectly from light curve modeling can help to differentiate single and binary progenitor scenarios and provide a framework for the application of this technique to future observations.
#### Extended Main-Sequence Turnoff and Red Clump in intermediate-age star  clusters: A study of NGC 419

 - **Abstract**
 With the goal of untangling the origin of extended main-sequence turnoffs (eMSTOs) and extended red clumps (eRCs) in star clusters, in this work we present the study of the intermediate-age cluster NGC 419, situated along the Bridge of the Small Magellanic Cloud. To this aim, we analyzed multi-epoch, high angular resolution observations acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope for this dynamically young cluster, which enabled the determination of precise proper motions and therefore the assessment of the cluster membership for each individual star in the field of view. With this unprecedented information at hand, we first studied the radial distribution of kinematically selected member stars in different eMSTO subregions. The absence of segregation supports the rotation scenario as the cause for the turnoff color extension and disfavors the presence of a prolonged period of star formation in the cluster. A similar analysis on the eRC of NGC 419 confirms the absence of segregation, providing further evidence against an age spread, which is at odds with previous investigations. Even so, the currently available evolutionary models including stellar rotation fail at reproducing the two photometric features simultaneously. We argue that either shortcomings in these models or a different origin for the red clump feature, such as a nonstandard differential mass loss along the red giant branch phase, are the only way to reconcile our observational findings with theoretical expectations.

 - **Abstract**
 Light echoes give us a unique perspective on the nature of supernovae and non-terminal stellar explosions. Spectroscopy of light echoes can reveal details on the kinematics of the ejecta, probe asymmetry, and reveal details on its interaction with circumstellar matter, thus expanding our understanding of these transient events. However, the spectral features arise from a complex interplay between the source photons, the reflecting dust geometry, and the instrumental setup and observing conditions. In this work we present an improved method for modeling these effects in light echo spectra, one that relaxes the simplifying assumption of a light curve weighted sum, and instead estimates the true relative contribution of each phase. We discuss our logic, the gains we obtain over light echo analysis method(s) used in the past, and prospects for further improvements. Lastly, we show how the new method improves our analysis of echoes from Tycho's supernova (SN 1572) as an example.
#### X-ray and Radio Monitoring of the Neutron Star Low Mass X-ray Binary 1A  1744-361: Quasi Periodic Oscillations, Transient Ejections, and a Disk  Atmosphere

 - **Abstract**
 We report on X-ray (NICER/NuSTAR/MAXI/Swift) and radio (MeerKAT) timing and spectroscopic analysis from a three-month monitoring campaign in 2022 of a high-intensity outburst of the dipping neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 1A 1744-361. The 0.5-6.8 keV NICER X-ray hardness-intensity and color-color diagrams of the observations throughout the outburst suggests that 1A 1744-361 spent most of its outburst in an atoll state, but we show that the source exhibited Z-state-like properties at the peak of the outburst, similar to a small sample of other sources in the atoll state. A timing analysis with NICER data revealed several instances of an $\approx8$ Hz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO; fractional rms amplitudes of ~5%) around the peak of the outburst, the first from this source, which we connect to the normal branch QPOs (NBOs) seen in the Z state. Our observations of 1A 1744-361 are fully consistent with the idea of the mass accretion rate being the main distinguishing parameter between atoll and Z states. Radio monitoring data by MeerKAT suggests that the source was at its radio-brightest during the outburst peak, and that the source transitioned from the 'island' spectral state to the 'banana' state within ~3 days of the outburst onset, launching transient jet ejecta. The observations present the strongest evidence for radio flaring, including jet ejecta, during the island-to-banana spectral state transition at low accretion rates (atoll state). The source also exhibited Fe XXV, Fe XXVI K$\alpha$, and K$\beta$ X-ray absorption lines, whose origins likely lie in an accretion disk atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST MIRI 5.6, 10 and 21 micron observations of the candidate failed supernova N6946-BH1 along with HST WFPC/IR 1.1 and 1.6 micron data and ongoing optical monitoring data with the LBT. There is a very red, dusty source at the location of the candidate which has only ~10-15% of the luminosity of the progenitor star. The source is very faint in the HST near-IR observations (~10^3 Lsun) and is not optically variable to a limit of ~10^3 Lsun at R-band. The dust is likely silicate and probably has to be dominated by very large grains as predicted for dust formed in a failed SN. The required visual optical depths are modest, so we should begin to have a direct view of the source in the near-IR in only a few years.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the collapse of dense molecular cloud cores to stellar densities and the subsequent evolution of the protostar is of importance to model the feedback effects such an object has on its surrounding environment, as well as describing the conditions with which it enters the stellar evolutionary track. This process is fundamentally multi-scale and necessitates the use of robust numerical simulations. We aim to model the birth and early evolution of a low-mass protostar. We also seek to describe the interior structure of the protostar and the radiative behavior of its accretion shock front. We carry out a high resolution numerical simulation of the collapse of a gravitationally unstable $1$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ dense molecular cloud core to stellar densities using three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics under the gray flux-limited diffusion approximation. We follow the initial isothermal phase, the first adiabatic contraction, the second gravitational collapse triggered by the dissociation of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecules, and $\approx 247$ days of the subsequent main accretion phase. We find that the sub-critical radiative behavior of the protostar's shock front causes it to swell as it accretes matter. We also find that the protostar is turbulent from the moment of its inception despite its radiative stability. This turbulence causes significant entropy mixing inside the protostar, which regulates the swelling. Furthermore, we find that the protostar is not fully ionized at birth, but the relative amount of ionized material within it increases as it accretes matter from its surroundings. Finally, we report in the results of the first 3D calculations involving a frequency-dependent treatment of radiative transfer, which has not produced any major differences with its gray counterpart.

 - **Abstract**
 The success of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission has led to the discovery of an abundance of Venus Zone (VZ) terrestrial planets that orbit relatively bright host stars. Atmospheric observations of these planets play a crucial role in understanding the evolutionary history of terrestrial planets, past habitable states, and the divergence of Venus and Earth climates. The transmission spectrum of a Venus-like exoplanet can be difficult to distinguish from that of an Earth-like exoplanet however, which could severely limit what can be learned from studying exoVenuses. In this work we further investigate differences in transmission between hypothetical exoEarths and exoVenuses, both with varying amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO$_2$). The exoEarths and exoVenuses were modelled assuming they orbit TRAPPIST-1 on the runaway greenhouse boundary. We simulated James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) PRISM transit observations of both sets of planets between 0.6-5.2 $\mu$m, and quantified the detectability of major absorption features in their transmission spectra. The exoEarth spectra include several large methane (CH$_4$) features that can be detected in as few as 6 transits. The CH$_4$ feature at 3.4 $\mu$m is the optimal for feature for discerning an exoEarth from an exoVenus since it is easily detectable and does not overlap with CO$_2$ features. The sulfur dioxide (SO$_2$) feature at 4.0 $\mu$m is the best indicator of an exoVenus, but it is detectable in atmospheres with reduced CO$_2$ abundance.
#### A comprehensive hydrodynamical study of SB DEM L50: understanding  off-centre SNe and soft X-ray luminosity

 - **Abstract**
 The superbubbles (SBs) carved in the interstellar medium by stellar winds and supernovae (SNe) are filled with hot ($T>$10$^{6}$~K) gas that produces soft X-ray emission (0.3-2.0\,keV). Models that assume a constant density medium and central SNe events fail to reproduce the soft X-ray luminosity that is observed in some SBs. We address this problem by generating models that trace the history of SNe in the SB and that produce off-centre SNe, that account for the missing soft X-ray emission. We test the models against archival, radio, optical, and X-ray observations of the SB DEM\,L50 located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The soft X-ray properties of DEM L50, including its high luminosity, makes it a perfect candidate to test our models. Furthermore, the multiple wave-band observations of this object will help us to assess how well our models can reproduce other SB properties beside its soft X-ray properties. We find that a configuration where DEM L50 forms at the edge of a filament reproduces the observed soft X-ray luminosity, optical morphology, shell velocity, and swept-up mass of neutral gas. This configuration is supported by IR observations of the LMC. In addition, we find that off-centre SNe, which enhance soft X-ray emission, naturally occur for all of the initial ambient conditions we tested in our models. Finally, we show that an off-centre SN can explain the observed soft X-ray luminosity of DEM L50, and that the resulting luminosity is consistent with a plasma in non-equilibrium ionisation.
#### GW190521: tracing imprints of spin-precession on the most massive black  hole binary

 - **Abstract**
 GW190521 is a remarkable gravitational-wave signal on multiple fronts: its source is the most massive black hole binary identified to date and could have spins misaligned with its orbit, leading to spin-induced precession -- an astrophysically consequential property linked to the binary's origin. However, due to its large mass, GW190521 was only observed during its final 3-4 cycles, making precession constraints puzzling and giving rise to alternative interpretations, such as eccentricity. Motivated by these complications, we trace the observational imprints of precession on GW190521 by dissecting the data with a novel time domain technique, allowing us to explore the morphology and interplay of the few observed cycles. We find that precession inference hinges on a quiet portion of the pre-merger data that is suppressed relative to the merger-ringdown. Neither pre-merger nor post-merger data alone are the sole driver of inference, but rather their combination: in the quasi-circular scenario, precession emerges as a mechanism to accommodate the lack of a stronger pre-merger signal in light of the observed post-merger. In terms of source dynamics, the pre-merger suppression arises from a tilting of the binary with respect to the observer. Establishing such a consistent picture between the source dynamics and the observed data is crucial for characterizing the growing number of massive binary observations and bolstering the robustness of ensuing astrophysical claims.
#### Hot Jupiters Have Giant Companions: Evidence for Coplanar  High-Eccentricity Migration

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01567
 - **Abstract**
 This study considers the characteristics of planetary systems with giant planets based on a population-level analysis of the California Legacy Survey planet catalog. We identified three characteristics common to hot Jupiters. First, while not all hot Jupiters have a detected outer giant planet companion ($M \sin i$ = 0.3--30 $M_{\textrm{Jup}}$), such companions are ubiquitous when survey completeness corrections are applied for orbital periods out to 40,000 days. Giant harboring systems without a hot Jupiter also host at least one outer giant planet companion per system. Second, the mass distributions of hot Jupiters and other giant planets are indistinguishable. However, within a planetary system that includes a hot Jupiter, the outer giant planet companions are at least $3\times$ more massive than the inner hot Jupiters. Third, the eccentricity distribution of the outer companions in hot Jupiter systems (with an average model eccentricity of $\langle e\rangle=0.34\pm0.05$) is different from the corresponding outer planets in planetary systems without hot Jupiters ($\langle e\rangle=0.19\pm0.02$). We conclude that the existence of two gas giants, where the outermost planet has an eccentricity $\ge0.2$ and is $3\times$ more massive, are key factors in the production of a hot Jupiter. Our simple model based on these factors predicts that $\sim$10\% of warm and cold Jupiter systems will by chance meet these assembly criteria, which is consistent with our measurement of $16\pm6\%$ relative occurrence of hot Jupiter systems to all giant-harboring systems. We find that these three features favor coplanar high-eccentricity migration as the dominant mechanism for hot Jupiter formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia DR3 provided a first release of RP spectra and astrophysical parameters for ultracool dwarfs. We used these Gaia RP spectra and astrophysical parameters to select the most outlying ultracool dwarfs. These objects have spectral types of M7 or later and might be young brown dwarfs or low metallicity objects. This work aimed to find ultracool dwarfs which have Gaia RP spectra significantly different to the typical population. However, the intrinsic faintness of these ultracool dwarfs in Gaia means that their spectra were typically rather low signal-to-noise in Gaia DR3. This study is intended as a proof-of-concept for future iterations of the Gaia data releases. Based on well studied subdwarfs and young objects, we created a spectral type-specific color ratio, defined using Gaia RP spectra; this ratio is then used to determine which objects are outliers. We then used the objects kinematics and photometry external to Gaia to cut down the list of outliers into a list of 'prime candidates'. We produce a list of 58 Gaia RP spectra outliers, seven of which we deem as prime candidates. Of these, six are likely subdwarfs and one is a known young stellar object. Four of six subdwarf candidates were known as subdwarfs already. The two other subdwarf candidates: 2MASS J03405673+2633447 (sdM8.5) and 2MASS J01204397+6623543 (sdM9), are new classifications.
#### Angular Correlations of Cosmic Microwave Background Spectrum Distortions  from Photon Diffusion

 - **Abstract**
 During cosmic recombination, charged particles bind into neutral atoms and the mean free path of photons rapidly increases, resulting in the familiar diffusion damping of primordial radiation temperature variations. An additional effect is a small photon spectrum distortion, because photons arriving from a particular sky direction were originally in thermal equilibrium at various spatial locations with different temperatures; the combination of these different blackbody temperature distributions results in a spectrum with a Compton $y$-distortion. Using the approximation that photons had zero mean free path prior to their second-to-last scattering, we derive an expression for the resulting $y$-distortion, and compute the angular correlation function of the diffusion $y$-distortion and its cross-correlation with the square of the photon temperature fluctuation. Detection of the cross-correlation is within reach of existing arcminute-resolution microwave background experiments such as the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 The Green Bank Telescope (GBT) Diffuse Ionized Gas Survey (GDIGS) traces ionized gas in the Galactic midplane by observing radio recombination line (RRL) emission from 4-8 GHz. The nominal survey zone is $32.3^{\circ}> {\ell} > -5^{\circ}$, $|b|<0.5^{\circ}$. Here, we analyze GDIGS Hn${\alpha}$ ionized gas emission toward discrete sources. Using GDIGS data, we identify the velocity of 35 H II regions that have multiple detected RRL velocity components. We identify and characterize RRL emission from 88 H II regions that previously lacked measured ionized gas velocities. We also identify and characterize RRL emission from eight locations that appear to be previously-unidentified H II regions and 30 locations of RRL emission that do not appear to be H II regions based on their lack of mid-infrared emission. This latter group may be a compact component of the Galactic Diffuse Ionized Gas (DIG). There are an additional 10 discrete sources that have anomalously high RRL velocities for their locations in the Galactic plane. We compare these objects' RRL data to 13CO, H I and mid-infrared data, and find that these sources do not have the expected 24 ${\mu}$m emission characteristic of H II regions. Based on this comparison we do not think these objects are H II regions, but we are unable to classify them as a known type of object.

 In this letter, we present a new method that quantitatively identifies the occurrence probability of equations of state (EoS) beyond "standard" EoS models that disfavor sharp and strong phase-transitions, based on neutron star mass and radius observations. The radii of two neutron stars with different masses are naturally correlated, in part because both of them are sensitive to the symmetry energy of the EoS. We show the radii of two neutron stars observed by NICER (PSR J0740+6620 and PSR 0030+0451) are correlated if these two neutron stars are built upon EoSs with no sharp and strong first-order phase transitions. We further show that the linear correlation of the neutron star radii can be significantly weakened, when strong and sharp first-order phase transitions occur. We propose a new quantity, ${D}_{\mathrm{L}}$, which measures the extent to which the linear correlation of the radii of two neutron stars is weakened. Our method gives a 48% identification probability (with a 5% false alarm rate) that the NICER observations indicate the necessity for a sharp and strong phase transition. Future observations can confirm or rule out this identification. Our method is generalizable to any pair of neutron star masses and can be employed with other sets of observations in the future.

 Advancements in space exploration and sample return technology present a unique opportunity to leverage sample return capsules (SRCs) towards studying atmospheric entry of meteoroids and asteroids. Specifically engineered for the secure transport of valuable extraterrestrial samples from interplanetary space to Earth, SRCs offer unexpected benefits that reach beyond their intended purpose. As SRCs enter the Earth's atmosphere at hypervelocity, they are analogous to naturally occurring meteoroids and thus, for all intents and purposes, can be considered artificial meteors. Furthermore, SRCs are capable of generating shockwaves upon reaching the lower transitional flow regime, and thus can be detected by strategically positioned geophysical instrumentation. NASA's OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer) SRC is one of only a handful of artificial objects to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere from interplanetary space since the end of the Apollo era and it will provide an unprecedented observational opportunity. This review summarizes past infrasound and seismic observational studies of SRC re-entries since the end of the Apollo era and presents their utility towards the better characterization of meteoroid flight through the atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 It has long been discussed whether stellar feedback in the form of winds and/or radiation can shred the nascent molecular cloud, thereby controlling the star formation rate. However, directly probing and quantifying the impact of stellar feedback on the neutral gas of the nascent clouds is challenging. We present an investigation doing exactly that toward the RCW 79 HII region using the ionized carbon line at 158 $\mu$m ([CII]) from the FEEDBACK Legacy Survey. We combine this data with information on the dozen ionizing O stars responsible for the evolution of the region, and observe in [CII] for the first time both blue- and red-shifted mostly neutral high-velocity gas which reaches velocities up to 25 km s$^{-1}$ relative to the bulk emission of the molecular cloud. This high-velocity gas mostly contains neutral gas and partly forms a fragmented shell, similar to recently found shells in a few Galactic HII regions. However, this shell does not account for all of the observed neutral high-velocity gas. We also find high-velocity gas streaming out of the nascent cloud through holes and obtain a range of dynamical timescales below 1.0 Myr for the high-velocity gas which is well below the 2.3$\pm$0.5 Myr age of the OB cluster. This suggests a different scenario for the evolution of RCW 79, where the high-velocity gas is not solely stemming from a spherical expanding bubble, but also from gas recently ablated at the edge of the turbulent molecular cloud into the surrounding interstellar medium through low-pressure holes or chimneys. The resulting mass ejection rate estimate for the cloud is 0.9-3.5$\times$10$^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$, which leads to short erosion timescales, i.e. $<$5 Myr, for the nascent molecular cloud. This finding provides direct observational evidence of rapid molecular cloud dispersal.

 - **Abstract**
 Photoionization models frequently assume constant temperature or density within HII regions. We investigate this assumption by measuring the detailed temperature and density structures of four HII regions in the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud, using integral-field spectroscopic data from the Wide-Field Spectrograph on the ANU 2.3m telescope. We analyse the distribution of emission-lines of low-ionization species, intermediate-ionization species and high-ionization species. We present the complex electron temperature and density structures within HII regions. All four nebulae present a negative gradient in the electron density profile. Both positive and negative temperature gradients are observed in the nebulae. We create a series of nebula models with a constant ISM pressure and varying temperature and density distributions. Comparison of the line ratios between our HII regions and models suggests that none of the simple nebula models can reproduce the observed temperature and density structures. Comparison between the models and the data suggests that the ISM pressure of nebulae in LMC and SMC is between log(P/k)=6-7.5. Complex internal structures of the nebulae highlight the importance of future Monte-Carlo photoionization codes for accurate nebula modeling, which include a comprehensive consideration of arbitrary geometries of HII regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the Galactic Center gamma-ray excess has not been conclusively determined after over a decade of careful study. The two most widely discussed possibilities are a population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs), and annihilation of dark matter particles. In contrast with annihilating dark matter, MSPs are expected to produce periodic emission. We show that even though the number of photons contributing to the excess is small, there is potentially sufficient information in the data from Fermi to detect a periodic MSP signal. Such a detection would definitively prove that at least some fraction of the excess is due to MSPs. We argue that this conclusion is robust to potential timing perturbations of the gamma-ray photons, such as those due to Earth's orbit, even if the number of parameters that must be used to model the perturbations is $\sim 7$.

 - **Abstract**
 Short period exoplanets on circular orbits are thought to be tidally locked into synchronous rotation. If tidally locked, these planets must possess permanent day- and nightsides, with extreme irradiation on the dayside and none on the nightside. However, so far the tidal locking hypothesis for exoplanets is supported by little to no empirical evidence. Previous work showed that the super-Earth LHS 3844b likely has no atmosphere, which makes it ideal for constraining the planet's rotation. Here we revisit the Spitzer phase curve of LHS 3844b with a thermal model of an atmosphere-less planet and analyze the impact of non-synchronous rotation, eccentricity, tidal dissipation, and surface composition. Based on the lack of observed strong tidal heating we rule out rapid non-synchronous rotation (including a Mercury-like 3:2 spin-orbit resonance) and constrain the planet's eccentricity to less than 0.001 (more circular than Io's orbit). In addition, LHS 3844b's phase curve implies that the planet either still experiences weak tidal heating via a small-but-nonzero eccentricity (requiring an undetected orbital companion), or that its surface has been darkened by space weathering; of these two scenarios we consider space weathering more likely. Our results thus support the hypothesis that short period rocky exoplanets are tidally locked, and further show that space weathering can significantly modify the surfaces of atmosphere-less exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-High Energy (UHE, $>$0.1\,PeV) $\gamma$-ray Astronomy is rapidly evolving into an expanding branch of the $\gamma$-ray astronomy with the surprising discovery of 12 PeVatrons and the detection of a handful of photons above 1 PeV. Nearly all known celestial object types that have emissions in the TeV band are found also emitting UHE photons. UHE $\gamma$-rays have a well-defined horizon inside our galaxy due to the absorption of infrared and cosmic microwave backgrounds in the universe. With the last 30 years, traditional cosmic ray (CR) detection techniques allow the detection of UHE $\gamma$-rays, and opened up the last observation window. For leptonic sources, UHE radiation is in the deep Klein-Nishina regime which is largely suppressed. Therefore UHE $\gamma$-ray detection will help to locate and identify hadronic radiation sources, tracing the historic pursuit for the origin of CRs around the knee of the spectrum. The Crab Nebula is again the focus of attention with measured photon emissions above 1\,PeV. In the absence of hadronic processes, this may indicate the existence of an extreme accelerator of e$^+$/e$^-$. Utilization of the CR extensive air shower detection techniques broadens the field of view of the source observations, enabling the measurement of UHE radiation surrounding the sources. These observations can probe the particle propagation inside and outside the accelerators and the subsequent injection/escape into the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 We use semi-analytical models to study the effects of primordial black hole (PBH) accretion on the cosmic radiation background during the epoch of reionization ($z\gtrsim 6$). We consider PBHs floating in the intergalactic medium (IGM), and located inside haloes, where star formation can occur. For stars with a mass $\gtrsim 25 \rm\ M_{\odot}$, formed in suitable host haloes, we assume they quickly burn out and form stellar remnant black holes (SRBHs). Since SRBHs also accrete material from their surroundings, we consider them to have similar radiation feedback as PBHs in the halo environment. To estimate the background radiation level more accurately, we take into account the impact of PBHs on structure formation, allowing an improved modeling of the halo mass function. We consider the radiation feedback from a broad suite of black holes: PBHs, SRBHs, high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We find that at $z\gtrsim 30$, the radiation background energy density is generated by PBHs accreting in the IGM, whereas at lower redshifts, the accretion feedback power from haloes dominates. We also analyze the total power density by modeling the accretion spectral energy distribution (SED), and break it down into select wavebands. In the UV band, we find that for $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-3}$, the H-ionizing and Lyman-$\alpha$ fluxes from PBH accretion feedback do not violate existing constraints on the timing of reionization, and on the effective Wouthuysen-Field coupling of the 21-cm spin temperature of neutral hydrogen to the kinetic temperature of the IGM. However, in the X-ray band, with the same abundance, PBHs contribute significantly and could account for the unresolved part of the cosmic X-ray background.

 - **Abstract**
 It is an open issue how the surrounding environment of supernova remnant shocks affect nonthermal X-rays from accelerated electrons, with or without interacting dense material. We have conducted spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of the shock-cloud interacting region of RCW 86 with XMM-Newton. It is found that bright soft X-ray filaments surround the dense cloud observed with 12CO and HI emission lines. These filaments are brighter in thermal X-ray emission, and fainter and possibly softer in synchrotron X-rays, compared to those without interaction. Our results show that the shock decelerates due to the interaction with clouds, which results in an enhancements of thermal X-ray emission. This could possibly also explain the softer X-ray synchrotron component, because it implies that those shocks that move through a low density environment, and therefore decelerate much less, can be more efficient accelerators. This is similar to SN 1006 and Tycho, and is in contrast to RX J1713.7-3946. This difference among remnants may be due to the clumpiness of dense material interacting with the shock, which should be examined with future observations.

 Many models of dark matter (DM) are now widely considered and probed intensively with accelerators, underground detectors, and astrophysical experiments. Among the various approaches, high-energy astrophysical observations are extremely useful to complement laboratory searches for some DM candidates. In the near future, the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) should enable us to access much heavier weakly interacting massive particles, as well as a broad range of other DM candidates. In this talk, we describe DM searches with CTA.

We use the model of the detector and the parametrization of showers for the identification of the most promising configuration of detector elements, using a likelihood ratio test statistic to classify showers and a stochastic gradient descent technique to maximize a utility function describing the measurement precision on the gamma-ray flux.

 Aims. LST-1, the prototype of the Large-Sized Telescope for the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, is concluding its commissioning in Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos on the island of La Palma. The proximity of LST-1 (Large-Sized Telescope 1) to the two MAGIC (Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov) telescopes permits observations of the same gamma-ray events with both systems. Methods. We describe the joint LST-1+MAGIC analysis pipeline and use simultaneous Crab Nebula observations and Monte Carlo simulations to assess the performance of the three-telescope system. The addition of the LST-1 telescope allows the recovery of events in which one of the MAGIC images is too dim to survive analysis quality cuts. Results. Thanks to the resulting increase in the collection area and stronger background rejection, we find a significant improvement in sensitivity, allowing the detection of 30% weaker fluxes in the energy range between 200 GeV and 3 TeV. The spectrum of the Crab Nebula, reconstructed in the energy range ~60 GeV to ~10 TeV, is in agreement with previous measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Approximated forms of the RII and RIII redistribution matrices are frequently applied to simplify the numerical solution of the radiative transfer problem for polarized radiation, taking partial frequency redistribution (PRD) effects into account. A widely used approximation for RIII is to consider its expression under the assumption of complete frequency redistribution (CRD) in the observer frame (RIII CRD). The adequacy of this approximation for modeling the intensity profiles has been firmly established. By contrast, its suitability for modeling scattering polarization signals has only been analyzed in a few studies, considering simplified settings. In this work, we aim at quantitatively assessing the impact and the range of validity of the RIII CRD approximation in the modeling of scattering polarization. Methods. We first present an analytic comparison between RIII and RIII CRD. We then compare the results of radiative transfer calculations, out of local thermodynamic equilibrium, performed with RIII and RIII CRD in realistic 1D atmospheric models. We focus on the chromospheric Ca i line at 4227 A and on the photospheric Sr i line at 4607 A.

 - **Abstract**
 Outgassing is a central process during the formation and evolution of terrestrial planets and their atmospheres both within and beyond the solar system. Although terrestrial planets' early atmospheres likely form via outgassing during planetary accretion, the connection between a planet's bulk composition and its initial atmospheric properties is not well understood. One way to inform this connection is to analyze the outgassing compositions of meteorites, and in particular carbonaceous chondrites, because they are some of the most volatile-rich, primitive materials (in terms of their bulk compositions) that are available for direct study. In addition, they may serve as compositional analogs for the building block materials of terrestrial planets in our solar system and around other Sun-like stars. This study builds upon previous outgassing experiments that monitored the abundances of volatile species (e.g., H2O, CO, and CO2) released from the Murchison meteorite. To gain a more complete understanding of Murchison's outgassing composition, we perform a series of heating experiments under atmospheric pressure (1 bar) and vacuum (1E-9 bar) conditions on samples of the Murchison meteorite and subsequent bulk element analysis to inform the outgassing trends of a suite of major elements in Murchison (e.g., Fe, Mg, Zn, and S). Under both pressure conditions, sulfur outgases significantly at the highest temperatures (800C - 1000C). For the samples heated under vacuum conditions, we also detect outgassing of zinc. Combined with prior outgassing experiments, this study provides important insights into the volatile depletion patterns of undifferentiated planetesimals and the early outgassing compositions of terrestrial exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of outflowing molecular gas at the center of the nearby radio galaxy NGC6328 (z=0.014), which has a gigahertz-peaked spectrum radio core and a compact (2 pc) young double radio lobe tracing jet. Utilizing Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) observations, as well as a novel code developed to fit the 3D gas distribution and kinematics, to study the molecular gas kinematics, we find that the bulk of the gas is situated within a highly warped disk structure, most likely the result of a past merger event. Our analysis further uncovers, within the inner regions of the gas distribution (R<300 pc) and at a position angle aligning with that of the radio jet (150 degrees), the existence of two anti-diametric molecular gas structures kinematically detached from the main disk. These structures most likely trace a jet-induced cold gas outflow with a total lower limit mass of $2\times 10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ mass, corresponding to an outflow rate of $2\,\mathrm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$ and a kinetic power of $2.7\times 10^{40}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$. The energy required to maintain such a molecular outflow is aligned with the mechanical power of the jet.

 The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is a next-generation ground-based gamma-ray observatory that will study the universe at very high energy using atmospheric Cherenkov light. CTAO will comprise over 67 telescopes of three different sizes, located in the northern and southern hemispheres. Among these, the Medium-Sized Telescope (MST) will play a crucial role in CTAO's observations, providing excellent sensitivity and angular resolution for gamma rays in the energy range of 100 GeV to 5 TeV. The MST is based on a modified single-mirror Davies-Cotton design, featuring a segmented mirror with a diameter of 12 meters, a total reflective surface of 88 square meters, and a focal length of 16 meters. It will cover an approximately 8-degree field of view and be equipped with two different cameras: NectarCAM and FlashCam, at the northern and southern CTAO sites, respectively. The MST's design is optimized for efficient observation of extended sources, including supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae, as well as the study of gamma-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei. Currently, the MST is in the midst of production and testing stages with the aim of being installed in 2025 for the CTAO Pathfinder project. In this project, one MST telescope will be deployed at each CTAO site to provide on-site experience with pre-production components. This approach facilitates cost and risk reduction before starting serial production. This contribution provides an overview of the current status and plans of the MST's construction at both the northern and southern CTAO sites, as well as details on the telescope and camera designs and their expected performance.

 - **Abstract**
 Contamination by Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is a ubiquitous challenge for radio astronomy. In particular, transient RFI is difficult to detect and avoid, especially in large data sets with many time bins. In this work, we present a Bayesian methodology for time-dependent, transient anomaly mitigation. In general, the computation time for correcting for transient anomalies in time-separated data sets grows proportionally with the number of time bins. We demonstrate that utilising likelihood reweighting can allow our Bayesian anomaly mitigation method to be performed with a computation time close to independent of the number of time bins. In particular, we identify a factor of 25 improvement in computation time for a test case with 2000 time bins. We also demonstrate how this method enables the flagging threshold to be fit for as a free parameter, fully automating the mitigation process. We find that this threshold fitting also prevents overcorrecting of the data in the case of wide priors. Finally, we investigate the potential of the methodology as a transient detector. We demonstrate that the method is able to reliably flag an individual anomalous data point out of 302,000 provided the SNR > 10.
#### Atmospheric dynamics and shock waves in RR Lyr

 - **Abstract**
 Although spectroscopic observations of RR Lyrae stars have now been carried out for almost a century, it is only recently that it has been identified that the hydrogen line exhibits three successive emissions in each pulsation cycle. The purpose of this study is to clarify the physical origin of these three emissions and their connection with atmospheric dynamics and the influence of Blazhko modulation on their intensity. From the value of the blueshift of the main H$\alpha$ emission, the velocity of the hypersonic shock front was estimated between 100 and 150 $\pm 10$ km$\,$s$^{-1}$ (Mach number between 10 and 15). It has been established that the shock velocity increases from the minimum Blazhko to its maximum, and after that, gradually decreases to the Blazhko minimum to start growing again. This observational result is consistent with the shock model proposed in 2013 to explain the Blazhko effect. The intensity of the H$\alpha$ emission increases with the shock velocity up to a maximum value around 137 km$\,$s$^{-1}$ and then decreases as the shock velocity increases further. This effect would be the consequence of the more and more important ionization of the atoms in the radiative shock wake. The second (blueshifted) H$\alpha$ emission, is the consequence of an approximately constant supersonic compression (Mach number between 2 and 3) of the upper atmosphere falling on the photospheric layers, during 3 to 16% of the pulsation period. Finally, the third H$\alpha$ emission (P-Cygni profile) would be the consequence of the expansion of the high atmosphere induced by the shock wave during its final weakening.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube neutrino observatory detected two distinct flares of high-energy neutrinos from the direction of the blazar TXS 0506+056: a $\sim 300$ TeV single neutrino on September 22, 2017 and a $3.5\sigma$ signature of a dozen TeV neutrinos in 2014/2015. In a previous work, it was shown that these two episodes of neutrino emission could be due to an inspiral of a supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) close to its merger at the core of TXS 0506+056. Such an inspiral can lead to quasi-periodic particle emission due to jet precession close to the final coalescence. This model made predictions on when the next neutrino emission episode must occur. On September 18, 2022, IceCube detected an additional, $\sim 170$ TeV neutrino in directional coincidence with the blazar TXS 0506+056, being consistent with the model prediction. Additionally, in April 2021, the Baikal Collaboration reported the detection of a $224\pm 75$ TeV neutrino, with TXS 0506+056 being in the uncertainty range of the event direction. We show that these four distinct flares of neutrino emission from TXS 0506+056 are consistent with a precessing jet scenario, driven by an inspiraling SMBBH. Using improved modeling, we are now able to constrain the total mass together with the mass ratio for the binary. We predict when the next neutrino flares from TXS 0506+056 should be happening. Finally, we estimate the detection potential of the Laser-interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) for the merger in the future.

 We present the continued analysis of polarization and Faraday rotation for the supernova remnants (SNRs) G46.8-0.3 and G39.2-0.3 in L-band (1-2 GHz) radio continuum in The HI/OH/Recombination line (THOR) survey. In this work, we present our investigation of Faraday depth fluctuations from angular scales comparable to the size of the SNRs down to scales less than our 16" beam (<~0.7 pc) from Faraday dispersion (sigma_phi). From THOR, we find median sigma_phi of 15.9 +/- 3.2 rad m^-2 for G46.8-0.3 and 17.6 +/- 1.6 rad m^-2 for G39.2-0.3. When comparing to polarization at 6cm, we find evidence for sigma_phi >~ 30 rad m^-2 in localized regions where we detect no polarization in THOR. We combine Faraday depth dispersion with the rotation measure (RM) structure function (SF) and find evidence for a break in the SF on scales less than the THOR beam. We estimate the RM SF of the foreground interstellar medium (ISM) using the SF of extra-Galactic radio sources (EGRS) and pulsars to find that the RM fluctuations we measure originate within the SNRs for all but the largest angular scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Nova Her 2021 was observed with TESS 12.62 days after its most recent outburst in June 12.537 2021. This cataclysmic variable belongs to the intermediate polar class, with an spin period of $\sim$501 s and orbital period of 0.1529 days. During TESS observations of Sector 40, the orbital period of 0.1529(1) days is detected significantly 17 days after the onset of the outburst. A modulation, of unknown origin, with a period of $\sim$0.537 days is present in the data from day 13 until day 17.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive spectro-polarimetric study of persistent Black hole X-ray binary 4U $1957\!+\!115$ with {\it IXPE} and {\it NICER} observations. The source is observed in disk dominated thermal state with disk temperature, kT$_{in}\approx1.4$ keV. The emission during thermal state from the source is found to be moderately polarized and \textit{IXPE} measures a degree of polarization (PD) $= 1.95\pm0.37\%$ ($>4.79\sigma$) along with a polarization angle (PA) $= -42.78^{\circ}\pm5.41^{\circ}$ in the energy range of $2-8$ keV. PD is found to be an increasing function of energy, whereas PA indicates switching within the energy range which could be due to high inclination and the returning radiation within the system. Simultaneous energy spectra ($0.6-10$ keV) from {\it NICER} are modelled to study the spectral properties. Furthermore, the spin parameter of the black hole is estimated with spectro-polarimetric data as a$_{\ast}=0.988\pm0.001\,(1\sigma)$, which is corroborated by {\it NICER} observations. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings.
#### High Angular Resolution Imaging of the V892 Tau Binary System: A New  Circumprimary Disk Detection and Updated Orbital Constraints

 - **Abstract**
 We present a direct imaging study of V892 Tau, a young Herbig Ae/Be star with a close-in stellar companion and circumbinary disk. Our observations consist of images acquired via Keck 2/NIRC2 with non-redundant masking and the pyramid wavefront sensor at K$^\prime$ band (2.12$\mu$m) and L$^\prime$ band (3.78$\mu$m). Sensitivity to low-mass accreting companions and cool disk material is high at L$^\prime$ band, while complimentary observations at K$^\prime$ band probe hotter material with higher angular resolution. These multi-wavelength, multi-epoch data allow us to differentiate the secondary stellar emission from disk emission and deeply probe the structure of the circumbinary disk at small angular separations. We constrain architectural properties of the system by fitting geometric disk and companion models to the K$^\prime$ and L$^\prime$ band data. From these models, we constrain the astrometric and photometric properties of the stellar binary and update the orbit, placing the tightest estimates to date on the V892 Tau orbital parameters. We also constrain the geometric structure of the circumbinary disk, and resolve a circumprimary disk for the first time.
