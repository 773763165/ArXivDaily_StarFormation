 - **Abstract**
 The production of long-lived radioactive isotopes due to the exposure to cosmic rays on the Earth's surface is an hazard for experiments searching for rare events like the direct detection of galactic dark matter particles. The use of large amounts of liquid Argon is foreseen in different projects, like the DarkSide-20k experiment, intended to look for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. Here, results from the study of the cosmogenic activation of Argon carried out in the context of DarkSide-20k are presented. The induced activity of several isotopes, including 39Ar, and the expected counting rates in the detector have been deduced, considering exposure conditions as realistic as possible.
#### Kilonova evolution -- the rapid emergence of spectral features

 - **Abstract**
 Kilonovae (KNe) are one of the fastest types of optical transients known, cooling rapidly in the first few days following their neutron-star merger origin. We show here that KN spectral features go through rapid recombination transitions, with features due to elements in the new ionisation state emerging quickly. Due to time-delay effects of the rapidly-expanding KN, a 'wave' of these new features passing though the ejecta should be a detectable phenomenon. In particular, isolated line features will emerge as blueshifted absorption features first, gradually evolving into more pronounced absorption/emission P Cygni features and then pure emission features. In this analysis we present the evolution of the individual exposures of the KN AT2017gfo observed with VLT/X-shooter that together comprise X-shooter's first epoch spectrum (1.43 days post-merger). We show that the spectra of these 'sub-epochs' show a significant evolution across the roughly one hour of observations, including a decrease of the blackbody temperature and photospheric velocity. The early cooling is even more rapid than that inferred from later photospheric epochs, and suggest a fixed power-law relation between temperature and time cannot capture the data. The cooling constrains the recombination-wave, where a Sr II interpretation of the AT2017gfo $\sim1 \mu$m feature predicts both a specific timing for the feature emergence and its early spectral shape, including the very weak emission component observed at 1.43 days. This reverberation analysis suggests that temporal modelling is important for interpreting individual spectra and that higher cadence spectral series, especially when concentrated at specific times, can provide strong constraints on KN line identifications. Given the use of such short-timescale information, we lay out improved observing strategies for future KN monitoring.
#### Kepler-discovered Multiple-planet Systems Near Period Ratios Suggestive  of Mean-motion Resonances Are Young

 - **Abstract**
 Before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope, models of low-mass planet formation predicted that convergent Type I migration would often produce systems of low-mass planets in low-order mean-motion resonances. Instead, Kepler discovered that systems of small planets frequently have period ratios larger than those associated with mean-motion resonances and rarely have period ratios smaller than those associated with mean-motion resonances. Both short-timescale processes related to the formation or early evolution of planetary systems and long-timescale secular processes have been proposed as explanations for these observations. Using a thin disk stellar population's Galactic velocity dispersion as a relative age proxy, we find that Kepler-discovered multiple-planet systems with at least one planet pair near a period ratio suggestive of a second-order mean-motion resonance have a colder Galactic velocity dispersion and are therefore younger than both single-transiting and multiple-planet systems that lack planet pairs consistent with mean-motion resonances. We argue that a non-tidal secular process with a characteristic timescale no less than a few hundred Myr is responsible for moving systems of low-mass planets away from second-order mean-motion resonances. Among systems with at least one planet pair near a period ratio suggestive of a first-order mean-motion resonance, only the population of systems likely affected by tidal dissipation inside their innermost planets has a small Galactic velocity dispersion and is therefore young. We predict that period ratios suggestive of mean-motion resonances are more common in young systems with 10 Myr $\lesssim \tau \lesssim 100$ Myr and become less common as planetary systems age.

 - **Abstract**
 Early expansion plays a fundamental role in the dynamical evolution of young star clusters. However, until very recently most of our understanding of cluster expansion was based only on indirect evidence or on statistically limited samples of clusters. Here we present a comprehensive kinematic analysis of virtually all known young ($t<300$ Myr) Galactic clusters based on the improved astrometric quality of the Gaia DR3 data. Such a large sample provides the unprecedented opportunity to robustly constrain the fraction of clusters and the timescale during which expansion has a prominent impact on the overall kinematics. We find that a remarkable fraction (up to $80\%$) of clusters younger than $\sim30$ Myr is currently experiencing significant expansion, whereas older systems are mostly compatible with equilibrium configurations. We observe a trend where the expansion speed increases with the clustercentric distance, suggesting that clusters undergoing expansion will likely lose a fraction of their present-day mass. Also, most young expanding clusters show large sizes, possibly due to the expansion itself. A comparison with a set of N-body simulations of young star clusters shows that the observed expansion pattern is in general qualitative agreement with that found for systems undergoing violent relaxation and evolving toward a final virial equilibrium state. However, we also note that additional processes likely associated with residual gas expulsion and mass loss due to stellar evolution are also likely to play a key role in driving the observed expansion.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical transient phenomena are traditionally classified spectroscopically in a hierarchical taxonomy; however, this graph structure is currently not utilized in neural net-based photometric classifiers for time-domain astrophysics. Instead, independent classifiers are trained for different tiers of classified data, and events are excluded if they fall outside of these well-defined but flat classification schemes. Here, we introduce a weighted hierarchical cross-entropy objective function for classification of astrophysical transients. Our method allows users to directly build and use physics- or observationally-motivated tree-based taxonomies. Our weighted hierarchical cross-entropy loss directly uses this graph to accurately classify all targets into any node of the tree, re-weighting imbalanced classes. We test our novel loss on a set of variable stars and extragalactic transients from the Zwicky Transient Facility, showing that we can achieve similar performance to fine-tuned classifiers with the advantage of notably more flexibility in downstream classification tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 We find ourselves on the brink of an exciting era in observational astrophysics, driven by groundbreaking facilities like JWST, Euclid, Rubin, Roman, SKA, or ELT. Simultaneously, computational astrophysics has shown significant strides, yielding highly realistic galaxy formation simulations, thanks to both hardware and software enhancements. Bridging the gap between simulations and observations has become paramount for meaningful comparisons. We introduce py-ananke, a Python pipeline designed to generate synthetic resolved stellar surveys from cosmological simulations, adaptable to various instruments. Building upon its predecessor, ananke by Sanderson et al. 2020 (arXiv:1806.10564), which produced Gaia DR2 mock star surveys, the py-ananke package offers a user-friendly "plug & play" experience. The pipeline employs cutting-edge phase-space density estimation and initial mass function sampling to convert particle data into synthetic stars, while interpolating pre-computed stellar isochrone tracks for photometry. Additionally, it includes modules for estimating interstellar reddening, dust-induced extinctions, and for quantifying errors through dedicated modeling approaches. py-ananke promises to serve as a vital bridge between computational astrophysics and observational astronomy, facilitating preparations and making scientific predictions for the next generation of telescopes.
#### Ultrafast compact binaries mergers

 - **Abstract**
 The duration of the gravitational waves (GW) induced orbital decay is often the bottleneck of the evolutionary phases going from star formation to a merger. We show here that kicks imparted to the newly born compact object during the second collapse generically result in a GW merger times distribution behaving like $dN/d\log t \propto t^{2/7}$ at short durations, leading to ultrafast mergers. Namely, a non-negligible fraction of neutron star binaries, formed in this way, will merge on a time scale as short as 10 Myr, and a small fraction will merge even on a time scale less than 10 kyr. The results can be applied to different types of compact binaries. We discuss here the implications for binary neutron star mergers. These include: unique short GRBs, eccentric and misaligned mergers, r-process enrichment in the very early Universe and in highly star-forming regions and possible radio precursors. Interestingly we conclude that among the few hundred short GRBs detected so far a few must have formed via this ultrafast channel.
#### Examining the Effects of Dark Matter Spikes on Eccentric Intermediate  Mass Ratio Inspirals Using $N$-body Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies have postulated that the presence of dark matter (DM) spikes around IMBHs could lead to observable dephasing effects in gravitational wave (GW) signals emitted by Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals (IMRIs). While prior investigations primarily relied on non-self-consistent analytic methods to estimate the influence of DM spikes on eccentric IMRIs, our work introduces the first self-consistent treatment of this phenomenon through $N$-body simulations. Contrary to previous studies, which suggested that dynamical friction (DF), a cumulative effect of two-body encounters, is the primary mechanism responsible for energy dissipation, we reveal that the slingshot mechanism, a three-body effect, plays a more significant role in driving the binary system's energy loss and consequent orbital shrinkage, similar to stellar loss cone scattering in Massive Black Hole (MBH) binaries. Furthermore, our work extends its analysis to include rotation in DM spikes, a factor often overlooked in previous studies. We find that binaries that counter-rotate with respect to the spike particles merge faster, while binaries that co-rotate merge slower, in opposition to the expectation from DF theory. While our models are idealistic, they offer findings that pave the way for a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between DM spikes, IMRIs, GW emission, and the ability to constrain DM microphysics. Our work systematically includes Post-Newtonian (PN) effects until 2.5 order and our results are accurate and robust.

 - **Abstract**
 M dwarfs are common host stars to exoplanets but often lack atmospheric abundance measurements. Late-M dwarfs are also good analogs to the youngest substellar companions, which share similar $T_{\rm eff}\sim2300-2800~K$. We present atmospheric analyses for the M7.5 companion HIP 55507 B and its K6V primary star with Keck/KPIC high-resolution ($R\sim35,000$) $K$ band spectroscopy. First, by including KPIC relative radial velocities between the primary and secondary in the orbit fit, we improve the dynamical mass precision by 60% and find $M_B=88.0_{-3.2}^{+3.4}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$, putting HIP 55507 B above the stellar-substellar boundary. We also find that HIP 55507 B orbits its K6V primary star with $a=38^{+4}_{-3}$ AU and $e=0.40\pm0.04$. From atmospheric retrievals of HIP 55507 B, we measure $\rm [C/H]=0.24\pm0.13$, $\rm [O/H]=0.15\pm0.13$, and $\rm C/O=0.67\pm0.04$. Moreover, we strongly detect $\rm ^{13}CO$ ($7.8\sigma$ significance) and tentatively detect $\rm H_2^{18}O$ ($3.7\sigma$ significance) in companion's atmosphere, and measure $\rm ^{12}CO/^{13}CO=98_{-22}^{+28}$ and $\rm H_2^{16}O/H_2^{18}O=240_{-80}^{+145}$ after accounting for systematic errors. From a simplified retrieval analysis of HIP 55507 A, we measure $\rm ^{12}CO/^{13}CO=79_{-16}^{+21}$ and $\rm C^{16}O/C^{18}O=288_{-70}^{+125}$ for the primary star. These results demonstrate that HIP 55507 A and B have consistent $\rm ^{12} C/^{13}C$ and $\rm ^{16}O/^{18}O$ to the $<1\sigma$ level, as expected for a chemically homogeneous binary system. Given the similar flux ratios and separations between HIP 55507 AB and systems with young, substellar companions, our results open the door to systematically measuring $\rm ^{13}CO$ and $\rm H_2^{18}O$ abundances in the atmospheres of substellar or even planetary-mass companions with similar spectral types.
#### Aerosols are not Spherical Cows: Using Discrete Dipole Approximation to  Model the Properties of Fractal Particles

 - **Abstract**
 The optical properties of particulate-matter aerosols, within the context of exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres, are compared using three different models: Mie theory, Modified Mean Field (MMF) Theory, and Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA). Previous results have demonstrated that fractal haze particles (MMF and DDA) absorb much less long-wavelength radiation than their spherical counterparts (Mie), however it is shown here that the opposite can also be true if a more varying refractive index profile is used. Additionally, it is demonstrated that absorption and scattering cross-sections, as well as the asymmetry parameter, are underestimated if Mie theory is used. Although DDA can be used to obtain more accurate results, it is known to be much more computationally intensive; to avoid this, the use of low-resolution aerosol models is explored, which could dramatically speed up the process of obtaining accurate computations of optical cross-sections within a certain parameter space. The validity of DDA is probed for wavelengths of interest for observations of aerosols within exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres (0.2 to 15 micrometres). Finally, novel code is presented to compare the results of Mie, MMF and DDA theories (CORAL: Comparison Of Radiative AnaLyses), as well as to increase and decrease the resolution of DDA shape files accordingly (SPHERIFY). Both codes can be applied to a range of other interesting astrophysical environments in addition to exoplanet atmospheres, for example dust grains within protoplanetary disks.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way's last significant merger, the Gaia Enceladus/Sausage (GES), is thought to have taken place between 8-11 Gyr ago. Recent studies in the literature suggest that the bar of the Milky Way is rather old, indicating that it formed at a similar epoch to the GES merger. We investigate the possible link between these events using one of the Auriga cosmological simulations which has salient features in common with the Milky Way, including a last significant merger with kinematic signatures resembling that of the GES. In this simulation, the GES-like merger event triggers tidal forces on the disc, gas inflows and a burst of star formation, with the formation of a bar occuring within 1 Gyr of the first pericentre. To highlight the effects of the merger, we rerun the simulation from z=4 with the progenitors of the GES-like galaxy removed well before the merger time. The consequence is a delay in bar formation by around 2 Gyr, and this new bar forms without any significant external perturbers. We conclude that this Milky Way-like simulation shows a route to the real Milky Way's bar formation being triggered primarily via tidal forces from the GES. We also note some later morphological differences between the disc of the original simulation and our rerun, in particular that the latter does not grow radially for the final 7 Gyr. Our study suggests that the GES may therefore be responsible for the formation of the Milky Way's bar, as well as for the build-up of its extended disc.
#### A Crater Chronology for the Jupiter's Asteroids

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new crater chronology for Jupiter's Trojan asteroids. This tool can be used to interpret the collisional history of the bodies observed by NASA's Lucy mission. The Lucy mission will visit a total of six Trojan asteroids: Eurybates, Polymele, Orus, Leucus, and the near equal mass binary Patroclus-Menoetius. In addition, Eurybates and Polymele each have a small satellite. Here we present a prediction of Trojan cratering based on current models of how the Solar System and the objects themselves evolved. We give particular emphasis to the time lapsed since their implantation into stable regions near Jupiter's Lagrangian L4 and L4 points. We find that cratering on Trojans is generally dominated by mutual collisions, with the exception of a short period of time (~10 Myr) after implantation, in which cometary impacts may have been significant. For adopted crater scaling laws, we find that the overall spatial density of craters on Trojans is significantly lower than that of Main Belt asteroids on surfaces with similar formation ages. We also discuss specific predictions for similar-sized Eurybates and Orus, and the binary system Patroclus-Menoetius.
#### Statistical Distribution Function of Orbital Spacings in Planetary  Systems

 - **Abstract**
 The minimum orbital separation of planets in long-stable planetary systems is often modeled as a step function, parameterized with a single value $\Delta_{min}$ (measured in mutual Hill radius of the two neighboring planets). Systems with smaller separations are considered unstable, and planet pairs with greater separations are considered stable. Here we report that a log-normal distribution function for $\Delta_{min}$, rather than a single threshold value, provides a more accurate model. From our suite of simulated planetary systems, the parameters of the best-fit log-normal distribution are $\mu=1.97\pm0.02$ and $\sigma=0.40\pm0.02$, such that the mean, median, and mode of $\Delta_{min}$ are 7.77, 7.17, and 6.11, respectively. This result is consistent with previous estimates for $\Delta_{min}$ threshold values in the range $\sim$5$-$8. We find a modest dependence of the distribution of $\Delta_{min}$ on multiplicity within the system, as well as on planetary mass ratios of the closest planet pair. The overall distribution of nearest-neighbor planetary orbital spacings (measured in the mutual Hill radii and denoted simply as $\Delta$) in long-term stable systems is also well fit with a log-normal distribution, with parameters $\mu=3.14\pm0.03$ and $\sigma=0.76\pm0.02$. In simulations of sets of many planets initially packed very close together, we find that the orbital spacings of long-term stable systems is statistically similar to that in the observed Kepler sample of exo-planetary systems, indicating a strong role of sculpting of planetary architectures by dynamical instabilities.
#### Metal-poor stars with disc-like orbits. Traces of the Galactic Disc at  very early epochs?

 - **Abstract**
 We use photometric metallicity estimates for about 700000 stars in the surroundings of the Sun, with very accurate distances and 3-D motions measures from Gaia DR3, to explore the properties of the metal-poor (-2.0<[Fe/H]<= -1.5; MP) and very metal-poor ([Fe/H]<= -2.0; VMP) stars with disc kinematics in the sample. We confirm the presence of a significant fraction of MP and VMP stars with disc-like orbits and that prograde orbits are prevalent among them, with prograde to retrograde ratio P/R ~3. We highlight for the first time a statistically significant difference in the distribution of the Z-component of the angular momentum (L_Z) and orbital eccentricity between prograde and retrograde disc-like MP stars. The same kind of difference is found also in the VMP subsample, albeit at a much lower level of statistical significance, likely due to the small sample size. We show that prograde disc-like MP and VMP stars display an additional component of the |L_Z| distribution with respect to their retrograde counterpart. This component is at higher |L_Z| with respect to the main peak of the distribution, possibly hinting at the presence of a pristine prograde disc in the Milky Way. This hypothesis is supported by the results of the analysis of a large sub-sample dominated by stars born in-situ. Also in this case the prevalence of prograde stars is clearly detected at [Fe/H]<= -1.5 and their |L_Z| distribution is more skewed toward high |L_Z| values than their retrograde counterpart. This suggests that the seed of what will eventually evolve into the main disc components of the Milky Way may have been already in place in the earliest phases of the Galaxy assembly.
#### WASP-69b's Escaping Envelope is Confined to a Tail Extending at Least  Seven Planet Radii

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the escaping atmospheres of highly-irradiated exoplanets is critical for understanding the physical mechanisms that shape the demographics of close-in planets. A number of planetary outflows have been observed as excess H/He absorption during/after transit. Such an outflow has been observed for WASP-69b by multiple groups that disagree on the geometry and velocity structure of the outflow. Here, we report the detection of this planet's outflow using Keck/NIRSPEC for the first time. We observed the outflow 1.28 hours after egress until the target set, demonstrating the outflow extends at least $5.8 \times 10^5$ km or 7.5 planet radii. This detection is significantly longer than previous observations which report an outflow extending $\sim$2.2 planet radii just one year prior. The outflow is blue-shifted by $-$23 km s$^{-1}$ in the planetary rest frame. We estimate a current mass loss rate of 1 $M_{\oplus}$ Gyr$^{-1}$. Our observations are most consistent with an outflow that is strongly sculpted by ram pressure from the stellar wind. However, potential variability in the outflow could be due to time-varying interactions with the stellar wind or differences in instrumental precision.
#### High-resolution transmission spectroscopy of ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-33b  with NEID

 - **Abstract**
 We report an attempt to detect molecular and atomic species in the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-33b using the high-resolution echelle spectrograph NEID with a wavelength coverage of 380$-$930 nm. By analyzing the transmission spectrum of WASP-33b using the line-by-line technique and the cross-correlation technique, we confirm previous detection of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, and Ca II infrared triplets. We find no evidence for a significant day-to-night wind in WASP-33b, taking into account the effects of stellar pulsations using a relatively novel GP method and poorly constrained systemic velocity measurements. We also detect the previously reported pre-transit absorption signal, which may be a pulsation mode induced by the planet. Combined with previous CARMENES and HARPS-N observations, we report the non-detection of TiO, Ti I, and V I in the transmission spectrum, while they were already detected in the dayside atmosphere of WASP-33b. This implies a difference in the chemical compositions and abundances between the dayside and terminator atmospheres of WASP-33b, and certainly requires further improvements in the sensitivity of the detection methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting anomalous behaviour of satellites is an important goal within the broader task of space situational awareness. The Two Line Element (TLE) data published by NORAD is the only widely-available, comprehensive source of data for satellite orbits. We present here a filtering approach for detecting anomalies in satellite orbits from TLE data. Optimal proposal particle filters are deployed to track the state of the satellites' orbits. New TLEs that are unlikely given our belief of the current orbital state are designated as anomalies. The change in the orbits over time is modelled using the SGP4 model with some adaptations. A model uncertainty is derived to handle the errors in SGP4 around singularities in the orbital elements. The proposed techniques are evaluated on a set of 15 satellites for which ground truth is available and the particle filters are shown to be superior at detecting the subtle in-track and cross-track manoeuvres in the simulated dataset, as well as providing a measure of uncertainty of detections.

 We introduce a novel halo/galaxy matching technique between two cosmological simulations with different resolutions, which utilizes the positions and masses of halos along their subhalo merger tree. With this tool, we conduct a study of resolution biases through the galaxy-by-galaxy inspection of a pair of simulations that have the same simulation configuration but different mass resolutions, utilizing a suite of IllustrisTNG simulations to assess the impact on galaxy properties. We find that, with the subgrid physics model calibrated for TNG100-1, subhalos in TNG100-1 (high resolution) have $\lesssim0.5$ dex higher stellar masses than their counterparts in the TNG100-2 (low-resolution). It is also discovered that the subhalos with $M_{\mathrm{gas}}\sim10^{8.5}{\rm M}_\odot$ in TNG100-1 have $\sim0.5$ dex higher gas mass than those in TNG100-2. The mass profiles of the subhalos reveal that the dark matter masses of low-resolution subhalos are $\sim0.6$ times lower within 2 kpc, near the resolution limit. The differences in stellar mass and hot gas mass are most pronounced in the central region. We exploit machine learning to build a correction mapping for the physical quantities of subhalos from low- to high-resolution simulations (TNG300-1 and TNG100-1), which enables us to find an efficient way to compile a high-resolution galaxy catalog even from a low-resolution simulation. Our tools can easily be applied to other large cosmological simulations, testing and mitigating the resolution biases of their numerical codes and subgrid physics models.

 - **Abstract**
 Timing a pulsar orbiting around Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) can provide us with a unique opportunity of testing gravity theories. We investigate the detectability of a vector charge carried by the Sgr A* black hole (BH) in the bumblebee gravity model with simulated future pulsar timing observations. The spacetime of a bumblebee BH introduces characteristic changes to the orbital dynamics of the pulsar and the light propagation of radio signals. Assuming a timing precision of 1 ms, our simulation shows that a 5-yr observation of a pulsar with an orbital period $P_b\sim 0.5\,{\rm yr}$ and an orbital eccentricity $e\sim 0.8$ can probe a vector charge-to-mass ratio as small as $Q/M\sim 10^{-3}$, which is much more stringent than the current constraint from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations, and comparable to the prospective constraint from extreme mass-ratio inspirals with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).

 - **Abstract**
 WL 17 is a Class I object and was considered to have a ring-hole structure. We analyzed the structure around WL 17 to investigate the detailed properties of WL 17. We used ALMA archival data, which have a higher angular resolution than previous observations. We investigated the WL 17 system with the 1.3 mm dust continuum and 12CO and C18O (J = 2-1) line emissions. The dust continuum emission showed a clear ring structure with inner and outer edges of ~11 and ~21 au, respectively. In addition, we detected an inner disk of < 5 au radius enclosing the central star within the ring, the first observation of this structure. Thus, WL 17 has a ring-gap structure, not a ring-hole structure. We did not detect any marked emission in either the gap or inner disk, indicating that there is no sign of a planet, circumplanetary disk, or binary companion. We identified the base of both blue-shifted and red-shifted outflows based on the 12CO emission, which is clearly associated with the disk around WL 17. The outflow mass ejection rate is ~3.6x10^-7 Msun yr-1 and the dynamical timescale is as short as ~ 10^4 yr. The C18O emission showed that an inhomogeneous infalling envelope, which can induce episodic mass accretion, is distributed in the region within ~1000 au from the central protostar. With these new findings, we can constrain the planet formation and dust growth scenarios in the accretion phase of star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the information content of 21cm intensity maps in redshift space using the 1-loop Effective Field Theory power spectrum model and the bispectrum at tree level. The 21cm signal contains signatures of dark matter, dark energy and the growth of large-scale structure in the Universe. These signatures are typically analyzed via the 2-point correlation function or power spectrum. However, adding the information from the 3-point correlation function or bispectrum will be crucial to exploiting next-generation intensity mapping experiments. The bispectrum could offer a unique opportunity to break key parameter degeneracies that hinder the measurement of cosmological parameters and improve on the precision. We use a Fisher forecast analysis to estimate the constraining power of the HIRAX survey on cosmological parameters, dark energy and modified gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 A considerable number of photographic plate archives exist world wide and digitization is in progress or already has been finished. Not only different type of scanners were used but also spatial resolution and dynamic range often were limited due to process duration and storage space. The open question is the effect of these limitations on the results. 61 high resolution photographic plates of the Gamma Cyg field from the Bruce astrograph at Landessternwarte Heidelberg--K\"onigstuhl (aperture 40~cm, focal length 200~cm) had been digitized both in Heidelberg and Sonneberg. Both scanners were set to 16 bit dynamic range. The Heidelberg scanner was operated at 2540 dpi resolution, resulting in a scale of 1 arcsec/pixel, while the Sonneberg scanner was operated at 1200 dpi, yielding a scale of 2.1 arsec/pixel. In the presented study the standard deviation of non--variable star light curves were examined in dependence of brightness and plate coordinates in both series. No evident differences could be found. A comparison of the analysis of both scan series will be presented.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyzed data from HaloSat observations for five fields in the Galactic disk located far away from the Galactic center (135$^{\circ}$ $<$ $l$ $<$ 254$^{\circ}$) to understand the nature of soft X-ray energy emission in the Galactic disk. The fields have 14$^{\circ}$ diameter and were selected to contain no significant high-flux X-ray sources. All five HaloSat soft X-ray energy spectra (0.4--7 keV with energy resolution of $<$100 eV below 1 keV) show a possibility of the presence of unresolved high-temperature plasma in the Galactic disk (UHTPGD) with a temperature of 0.8--1.0 keV and an emission measure of (8--11)$\times10^{-4} \rm cm^{-6} pc$ in addition to the soft X-ray diffuse background components mainly studied at higher galactic latitudes (solar wind charge exchange emission, local hot bubble, Milky Way halo emission, and the cosmic X-ray background). This suggests that the UHTPGD is present across the whole Galactic disk. We also observed UHTPGD emission in a region with no bright sources in an {\it XMM-Newton} field contained within one of the {\it HaloSat} fields. The temperature and emission measure are consistent with those measured with {\it HaloSat}. Moreover, the stacked spectra of the X-ray point-like sources and NIR-identified point sources such as stars in the {\it XMM-Newton} field also show a spectral feature similar to the UHTPGD emission. This suggests that the UHTPGD may partly originate from point-like sources such as stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic Center Excess (GCE), one of the most remarkable discoveries by Fermi-LAT, has prompted extensive exploration over the past decade, often attributed to dark matter or millisecond pulsars. This work proposes a novel interpretation on the origin of the GCE, focusing on the observed spectral shape. Protons are accelerated at the Galactic center and collide with the neutron cluster on the surface of the non-rotating neutron stars. Due to the gluon condensation in nucleons, these collisions produce a large number of mesons, which have reached to the saturation state and subsequently generate the broken power law in the gamma ray spectra. We explained the spectral shape of GCE using the gluon condensation and an assumption of existing the non-rotating neutron stars at the Galactic center. This example of the gluon condensation mechanism not only expands the applications of the hadronic scenario in the cosmic gamma ray spectra but also provides a new evidence of the gluon condensation.

 - **Abstract**
 Theories of spiral structure traditionally separate into tight-winding Lin-Shu spiral density waves and the swing-amplified material patterns of Goldreich & Lynden-Bell and Julian & Toomre. In this paper we consolidate these two types of spirals into a unified description, treating density waves beyond the tight-winding limit, in the regime of shearing and non-steady open spirals. This 'shearing wave' scenario novelly captures swing amplification that enables structure formation above conventional Q thresholds. However, it also highlights the fundamental role of spiral forcing on the amplification process in general, whether the wave is shearing or not. Thus it captures resonant and non-resonant mode growth through the donkey effect described by Lynden-Bell & Kalnajs and, critically, the cessation of growth when donkey behavior is no longer permitted. Our calculations predict growth exclusive to trailing spirals above the Jeans length, the prominence of spirals across a range of orientations that increases with decreasing arm multiplicity, and a critical orientation where growth is fastest that is the same for both modes and material patterns. Predicted structures are consistent with highly regular, high-multiplicity gaseous spur features and long filaments spaced close to the Jeans scale in spirals and bars. Applied to stellar disks, conditions favor low multiplicity (m<5) open trailing spirals with pitch angles in the observed range $10 deg$<$i_p$<$50 deg$. The results of this work serve as a basis for describing spirals as a unified class of transient waves, abundantly stimulated but narrowly selected for growth depending on local conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Comet 46P/Wirtanen is a near-Earth object (NEO) for which no associated meteor shower has ever been reported. Aims. This study is aimed at improving our understanding of why there has been no observed shower activity for this NEO to date, as well as to consider whether any past activity could be uncovered from the post-prediction results. Methods. The usual dynamic tools for meteoroid streams were used to describe the behavior of the particles ejected by the comet. The resulting modeled meteoroid stream was thoroughly inspected for collisions between the stream and the Earth. Results. The results show a possible encounter forecast for December 12, 2023, between 8:00 and 12:30 UT. The slow entry velocity is typically known to cause dim meteors. The activity level of the shower is highly uncertain due to the absence of reported past showers. Conclusions. Overall, the most optimal observations on the forecasted day would be achieved from Eastern Australia, New Zealand, and Oceania. These observations will help constrain the size distribution of meteoroids from comet 46P/Wirtanen in the millimeter range.

 The dark compact object at the centre of the Milky Way is well established to be a supermassive black hole with mass $M_{\bullet} \sim 4.3 \cdot 10^6 \, M_{\odot}$, but the nature of its environment is still under debate. In this work, we used astrometric and spectroscopic measurements of the motion of the star S2, one of the closest stars to the massive black hole, to determine an upper limit on an extended mass composed of a massive vector field around Sagittarius A*. For a vector with effective mass $10^{-19} \, \rm eV \lesssim m_s \lesssim 10^{-18} \, \rm eV$, our Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis shows no evidence for such a cloud, placing an upper bound $M_{\rm cloud} \lesssim 0.1\% M_{\bullet}$ at $3\sigma$ confidence level. We show that dynamical friction exerted by the medium on S2 motion plays no role in the analysis performed in this and previous works, and can be neglected thus.

 - **Abstract**
 The period-luminosity (PL) relation of Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) plays a pivotal role in extra-galactic distance measurement and the determination of the Hubble constant $(H_{0})$. In this work, we probe the geometry of the LMC through a detailed study of multi-phase PL relations of these Cepheids, leveraging data from the OGLE-IV and Gaia DR3 databases. We analyse the light curves of a combined sample of $\sim$3300 fundamental (FU) and first overtone (FO) mode classical Cepheids. We obtain multi-phase data with $50$ phase points over a complete pulsation cycle from the OGLE $(V, I)$ and Gaia $(G,G_{\rm BP}, G_{\rm RP})$ photometric bands. We determine the distance modulus and reddening values of individual Cepheids by fitting a simultaneous reddening law to the apparent distance modulus values. We calculate the LMC viewing angle parameters: the inclination angle $(i)$ and position angle of line of nodes $(\theta_{\rm lon})$ by fitting a plane of the form $z = f(x,y)$ to the three-dimensional distribution of Cepheids in Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$. The values of LMC viewing angles from multi-phase PL relations are found to be: $i = 22\rlap{.}^{\circ}87 \pm 0\rlap{.}^{\circ}43 ~\textrm{(stat.)} \pm 0\rlap{.}^{\circ}53 ~\textrm{(syst.)}$, $\theta_{\rm lon} = 154\rlap{.}^{\circ}76 \pm 1\rlap{.}^{\circ}16 ~\textrm{(stat.)} \pm 1\rlap{.}^{\circ}01 ~\textrm{(syst.)}$, respectively. The use of multi-phase PL relations in multiple bands results in lower uncertainties for the LMC viewing angle parameters as compared to those derived from the mean light PL relations. This shows that the use of multi-phase PL relations with multi-wavelength photometry significantly improves the precision of these measurements, allowing better constraints on the morphology and the structure of the LMC.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the contribution of tensor modes, in addition to the dominant scalar ones, on the temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). To this end, we analyze in detail the temperature two-point angular correlation function $C(\theta)$ from the Planck 2018 dataset, focusing on large angles ($\theta \gtrsim 120^{\circ}$) corresponding to small $\ell$ multipoles. A hierarchical set of infrared cutoffs are naturally introduced to the scalar and tensor power spectra of the CMB by invoking an extra Kaluza-Klein dimension compactifying at about the GUT scale between the Planck epoch and the start of inflation. We associate this set of lower scalar and tensor cutoffs with the parity of the multipole expansion of the $C(\theta)$ function. By fitting the Planck 2018 data we compute the multipole coefficients thereby reproducing the well-known odd-parity preference in angular correlations seen by all three satellite missions COBE, WMAP and Planck. Our fits improve significantly once tensor modes are included in the analysis, hence providing a hint of the imprints of primordial gravitational waves on the temperature correlations observed in the CMB today. To conclude we suggest a relationship between, on the one hand, the lack of (positive) large-angle correlations and the odd-parity dominance in the CMB and, on the other hand, the effect of primordial gravitational waves on the CMB temperature anisotropies.

 - **Abstract**
 Starting from the observing campaign in April 2018, the Greenland Telescope (GLT) has been added as a new station of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) array. Visibilities on baselines to the GLT, particularly in the North-South direction, potentially provide valuable new constraints for the modeling and imaging of sources such as M87*. The GLT's location at high Northern latitudes adds unique challenges to its calibration strategies. Additionally, the performance of the GLT was not optimal during the 2018 observations due to it being only partially commissioned at the time. This document describes the steps taken to estimate the various parameters (and their uncertainties) required for the absolute flux calibration of the GLT data as part of the EHT. In particular, we consider the non-optimized status of the GLT in 2018, as well as its improved performance during the 2021 EHT campaign.

 - **Abstract**
 Betelgeuse, a red supergiant star of semi-regular variability, underwent a historical minimum of brightness in February 2020, the Great Dimming. Even though the brightness has returned to the values prior to the Great Dimming by now, it continues to exhibit highly unusual behavior. Understanding the long-term atmospheric motions of Betelgeuse and its variability could be a clue to the nature of the Great Dimming and the mass-loss process in red supergiants. Our goal is to study long-term dynamics of the photosphere. We applied the tomographic method, which allows different layers in the stellar atmosphere to be probed in order to reconstruct depth-dependent velocity fields. The method is based on the construction of spectral masks by grouping spectral lines from specific optical depths. These masks are cross-correlated with the observed spectra to recover the velocity field inside each atmospheric layer. We obtained about 2700 spectra during the past 15 years, observed with the STELLA robotic telescope in Tenerife. We analysed the variability of 5 different layers of Betelgeuses photosphere. We found phase shift between the layers, as well as between the variability of velocity and photometry. The time variations of the widths of the cross-correlation function reveal propagation of two shock waves during the Great Dimming. For about 2 years after the Dimming, the time scale of variability was different between the inner and outer photospheric layers. By 2022, all the layers seemingly started to follow a similar behavior as before the Dimming, but pulsating with higher frequency corresponding with the first overtone. Combination of the extensive high-resolution spectroscopic data set with the tomographic method revealed the variable velocity fields in the photosphere of Betelgeuse, for the first time in such detail.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the Jupiter Trojan asteroids has long been a mystery. Dynamically, the population, which is considerably smaller than the main asteroid belt, librates around Jupiter's stable L4 and L5 Lagrange points, 60 deg ahead and behind Jupiter. It is thought that these bodies were captured into these orbits early in solar system history, but any capture mechanism must also explain why the Trojans have an excited inclination distribution, with some objects reaching inclinations of 35 deg. The Trojans themselves, individually and in aggregate, also have spectral and physical properties that appear consistent with many small bodies found in the outer solar system (e.g., irregular satellites, Kuiper belt objects). In this review, we assemble what is known about the Trojans and discuss various models for their origin and collisional evolution. It can be argued that the Trojans are unlikely to be captured planetesimals from the giant planet zone, but instead were once denizens of the primordial Kuiper belt, trapped by the events taking place during a giant planet instability. The Lucy mission to the Trojans is therefore well positioned to not only answer questions about these objects, but also about their place in planet formation and solar system evolution studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of nine bright spectroscopic binaries (HD 1585, HD 6613, HD 12390, HD 39923, HD 55201, HD 147430, HD 195543, HD 202699, HD 221643), which have orbital periods of P > 500 days. These well-separated binaries are the last stars of our sample that we observed with the TIGRE telescope obtaining intermediate-resolution spectra of R = 20,000. We applied the same method as described in our previous publication of this series. For the analysis of the radial velocity curves, we used the toolkit RadVel, which allowed us to determine all orbital parameters. Recently published orbital solutions of some systems from Gaia DR3 agree with our results. However, our solutions have much smaller uncertainties. We determined the basic stellar parameters of the primary stars with our automatic script using iSpec. The parameter determination allowed us to place all nine stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We found that all stars have already evolved to the giant phase. A comparison with stellar evolution tracks of the Eggleton code was applied to determine the stellar masses and ages. As a result of our analysis, we were able to estimate the masses of the secondary stars and the orbital inclinations of the binary systems.

#### Zero and extremely low metallicity rotating massive stars: evolution,  explosion, and nucleosynthesis up to the heaviest nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 We present the evolution and the explosion of two massive stars, 15 and 25 M$_{\odot}$, spanning a wide range of initial rotation velocities (from 0 to 800 km/s) and three initial metallicities: Z=0 ([Fe/H]=$-\infty$), $3.236\times10^{-7}$ ([Fe/H]=-5), and $3.236\times10^{-6}$ ([Fe/H]=-4). A very large nuclear network of 524 nuclear species extending up to Bi has been adopted. Our main findings may be summarized as follows: a) rotating models above Z=0 are able to produce nuclei up to the neutron closure shell at N=50, and in a few cases up to N=82; b) rotation drastically inhibits the penetration of the He convective shell in the H rich mantle, phenomenon often found in zero metallicity non rotating massive stars; c) vice versa rotation favors the penetration of the O convective shell in the C rich layers with the consequence of altering significantly the yields of the products of the C, Ne, and O burning; d) none of the models that reach the critical velocity while in H burning, loses more the 1 M$_{\odot}$ in this phase; e) conversely, almost all models able to reach their Hayashi track exceed the Eddington luminosity and lose dynamically almost all their H rich mantle. These models suggest that rotating massive stars may have contributed significantly to the synthesis of the heavy nuclei in the first phase of enrichment of the interstellar medium, i.e., at early times.

 The delensing of cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps will be increasingly valuable for extracting as much information as possible from future CMB surveys. Delensing provides many general benefits, including sharpening of the acoustic peaks, more accurate recovery of the damping tail, and reduction of lensing-induced $B$-mode power. In this paper we present several applications of delensing focused on testing theories of early-universe inflation with observations of the CMB. We find that delensing the CMB results in improved parameter constraints for reconstructing the spectrum of primordial curvature fluctuations, probing oscillatory features in the primordial curvature spectrum, measuring the spatial curvature of the universe, and constraining several different models of isocurvature perturbations. In some cases we find that delensing can recover almost all of the constraining power contained in unlensed spectra, and it will be a particularly valuable analysis technique to achieve further improvements in constraints for model parameters whose measurements are not expected to improve significantly when utilizing only lensed CMB maps from next-generation CMB surveys. We also quantify the prospects of testing the single-field inflation tensor consistency condition using delensed CMB data; we find it to be out of reach of current and proposed experimental technology and advocate for alternative detection methods.

 Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) is a promising alternative to dark matter. To further test the theory, there is a need for fluid- and particle-dynamics simulations. The force in MOND is not a direct particle-particle interaction, but derives from a potential for which a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) needs to be solved. Normally, this makes the problem of simulating dynamical evolution computationally expensive. We intend to develop a fast particle-mesh (PM) code for MOND (the AQUAL formalism). We transformed the nonlinear equation for MOND into a system of linear PDEs plus one algebraic equation. An iterative scheme with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) produces successively better numerical approximations. The algorithm was tested for dynamical systems in MOND where analytical solutions are known: the two-body problem, a body with a circular ring, and a spherical distribution of particles in thermal equilibrium in the self-consistent potential. The PM code can accurately calculate the forces at subpixel scale and reproduces the analytical solutions. Four iterations are required for the potential, but when the spatial steps are small compared to the kernel width, one iteration is suffices. The use of a smoothing kernel for the accelerations is inevitable in order to eliminate the self-gravity of the point particles. Our PDE solver is $15$ to $42$ times as slow as a standard Poisson solver. However, the smoothing and particle propagation takes up most of the time above one particle per $10^3$ pixels. The FFTs, the smoothing, and the propagation part in the code can all be parallelized.

 Cosmological parameter inference has been dominated by the Bayesian approach for the past two decades, primarily due to its computational efficiency. However, the Bayesian approach involves integration of the posterior probability and therefore depends on both the choice of model parametrisation and the choice of prior on the model parameter space. In some cases, this can lead to conclusions which are driven by choice of parametrisation and priors rather than by data. The profile likelihood method provides a complementary frequentist tool which can be used to investigate this effect. In this paper, we present the code PROSPECT for computing profile likelihoods in cosmology. We showcase the code using a phenomenological model for converting dark matter into dark radiation that suffers from large volume effects and prior dependence. PROSPECT is compatible with both cobaya and MontePython, and is publicly available at https://github.com/AarhusCosmology/prospect_public.
