 - **Abstract**
 A long-lived civilization will inevitably have to migrate towards a nearby star as its home star runs out of nuclear fuel. One way to achieve such a migration is by transforming its star into a stellar engine, and to control its motion in the galaxy. We first provide a brief overview of stellar engines and conclude that looking for technosignatures of stellar engines has taken two roads: on the observational side, hypervelocity stars have been the target of such searches, but without good candidates. On the theoretical side, stellar engine concepts have been proposed but are poorly linked to observable technosignatures. Since about half the stars in our galaxy are in binary systems where life might develop too, we introduce a model of a binary stellar engine. We propose mechanisms for acceleration, deceleration, steering in the orbital plane and outside of the orbital plane. We apply the model to candidate systems, spider pulsars, which are binary stars composed of one millisecond pulsar and a very low-mass companion star that is heavily irradiated by the pulsar wind. We discuss potential signatures of acceleration, deceleration, steering, as well as maneuvers such as gravitational assists or captures. Keywords: Pulsars: Spiders, Technosignatures, Stellar engine, Interstellar travel

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter is a fundamental constituent of the universe, which is needed to explain a wide variety of astrophysical and cosmological observations. Although the existence of dark matter was first postulated nearly a century ago and its abundance is precisely measured, approximately five times larger than that of ordinary matter, its underlying identity remains a mystery. A leading hypothesis is that it is composed of new elementary particles, which are predicted to exist in many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. In this article we review the basic evidence for dark matter and the role it plays in cosmology and astrophysics, and discuss experimental searches and potential candidates. Rather than targeting researchers in the field, we aim to provide an accessible and concise summary of the most important ideas and results, which can serve as a first entry point for advanced undergraduate students of physics or astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 We address the orbital distribution of stars in merging nuclear star clusters (NSCs) and the subsequent effects on supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) evolution. We ran direct-summation $N$-body simulations with different initial conditions to do a detailed study of the resulting NSC after their progenitors had merged. Our findings reveal that prograde stars form a flattened structure, while retrograde stars have a more spherical distribution. The axial ratios of the prograde component vary based on the presence and mass ratio of the SMBHs. The fraction of prograde and retrograde stars depends on the merger orbital properties and the SMBH mass ratio. The interactions of retrograde stars with the SMBHB affect the eccentricity and separation evolution of the binary. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the angular momentum and eccentricity of the SMBH binary. This relationship could serve as a means to infer information about the stellar dynamics surrounding the binary. We find that prograde orbits are particularly close to the binary of SMBHs, a promising fact regarding extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) production. Moreover, prograde and retrograde stars have different kinematic structures, with the prograde stars typically rotating faster than the retrograde ones. The line-of-sight velocity and velocity dispersion, as well as the velocity anisotropy of each NSC, depend on the initial merger orbital properties and SMBH mass ratios. The prograde and retrograde stars always show different behaviours. The distribution of stellar orbits and the dynamical properties of each kinematic population can potentially be used as a way to tell the properties of the parent nuclei apart, and has an important impact on expected rates of EMRIs, which will be detected by future gravitational wave observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).

          The cold Jupiter eccentricity distribution is consistent with EKL driven by stellar companions

 - **Abstract**
 The large eccentricities of cold Jupiters and the existence of hot Jupiters have long challenged theories of planet formation. A proposed solution to both of these puzzles is high-eccentricity migration, in which an initially cold Jupiter is excited to high eccentricities before being tidally circularized. Secular perturbations from an inclined stellar companion are a potential source of eccentricity oscillations, a phenomenon known as the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. Previous studies have found that the cold Jupiter eccentricity distribution produced by EKL is inconsistent with observations. However, these studies assumed all planets start on circular orbits. Here, we revisit this question, considering that an initial period of planet-planet scattering on $\sim$Myr timescales likely places planets on slightly eccentric orbits before being modulated by EKL on $\sim$Myr-Gyr timescales. Small initial eccentricities can have a dramatic effect by enabling EKL to act at lower inclinations. We numerically integrate the secular hierarchical three-body equations of motion, including general relativity and tides, for populations of cold giant planets in stellar binaries with varied initial eccentricity distributions. For populations with modest initial mean eccentricities, the simulated eccentricity distribution produced by EKL is statistically consistent with the observed eccentricities of cold single-planet systems. The lower eccentricities in a multi-planet control sample suggest that planetary companions quench stellar EKL. We show that scattering alone is unlikely to reproduce the present-day eccentricity distribution. We also show that the anisotropic inclination distribution produced by EKL may lead radial velocity measurements to underestimate giant planet masses.

          Constrain Spatial Curvature and Dark Energy with Strong Lenses and Complementary Probes: a Forecast for Next-Generation Surveys

 - **Abstract**
 Inferring spatial curvature of the Universe with high-fidelity is a longstanding interest in cosmology. However, the strong degeneracy between dark energy equation-of-state parameter $w$ and curvature density parameter $\Omega_{\rm K}$ has always been a hurdle for precision measurements of curvature from late-universe probes. With the imminent commissioning of Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we demonstrate for the first time, using simulations of stage-IV surveys, the crucial role of time-delay distances from strong gravitational lenses in breaking this degeneracy. Our findings suggest that in non-flat $ow$CDM model, while strong lensing data alone only yield a $\Omega_{\rm K}$ constraint at $\sim O(10^{-1})$ level, the integration with SNe Ia and BAO data breaks the $w$-$\Omega_{\rm K}$ degeneracy and refines the $\Omega_{\rm K}$ constraint to $\sim O(10^{-2})$. This surpasses the constraints typically derived from SNe Ia Hubble diagrams and BAO data and is comparable to the constraints obtained from \textit{Planck} Primary CMB data. Additionally, we present a non-parametric approach using Gaussian Process to avoid parameter-dependency of the expansion history $H(z)$ and achieve similar $O(10^{-2})$ level constraint on $\Omega_{\rm K}$. This study demonstrates the significant potential of strong gravitational lenses and Stage-IV surveys like LSST to achieve high-fidelity, independent constraints on $\Omega_{\rm K}$, contributing to our understanding of the Universe's geometry and the dynamics of dark energy.

          Are Models of Strong Gravitational Lensing by Clusters Converging or Diverging?

 - **Abstract**
 The increasingly large numbers of multiple images in cluster-scale gravitational lenses have allowed for tighter constraints on the mass distributions of these systems. Most lens models have progressed alongside this increase in image number. The general assumption is that these improvements would result in lens models converging to a common solution, suggesting that models are approaching the true mass distribution. To test whether or not this is occurring, we examine a sample of lens models of MACS J0416.1$-$2403 containing varying number of images as input. Splitting the sample into two bins (those including $<150$ and $>150$ images), we quantify the similarity of models in each bin using three comparison metrics, two of which are novel: Median Percent Difference, Frechet Distance, and Wasserstein Distance. In addition to quantifying similarity, the Frechet distance metric seems to also be an indicator of the mass sheet degeneracy. Each metric indicates that models with a greater number of input images are no more similar between one another than models with fewer input images. This suggests that lens models are neither converging nor diverging to a common solution for this system, regardless of method. With this result, we suggest that future models more carefully investigate lensing degeneracies and anomalous mass clumps (mass features significantly displaced from baryonic counterparts) to rigorously evaluate their model's validity. We also recommend further study into alternative, underutilized lens model priors (e.g. flux ratios) as an additional input constraint to image positions in hopes of breaking existing degeneracies.

          Leveraging neutrino flavor physics for supernova model differentiation

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino flavor evolution is critical for understanding the physics of dense astrophysical regimes, including core-collapse supernovae (CCSN). Powerful numerical integration codes exist for simulating these environments, yet a complete understanding of the inherent nonlinearity of collective neutrino flavor oscillations and how it fits within the overall framework of these simulations remains an open challenge. For this reason, we continue developing statistical data assimilation (SDA) to infer solutions to the flavor field in a CCSN envelope, given simulated measurements far from the source. SDA is an inference paradigm designed to optimize a model with sparse data. Our model consists of neutrino beams emanating from a CCSN and coherently interacting with each other and with a background of other matter particles in one dimension $r$. One model feature of high interest is the distribution of those matter particles as a function of radius $r$, or the "matter potential" $V(r)$ -- as it significantly dictates flavor evolution. In this paper, we expand the model beyond previous incarnations, by replacing the monotonically-decaying analytic form for $V(r)$ we previously used with a more complex -- and more physically plausible -- set of profiles derived from a one-dimensional (spherically symmetric) hydrodynamics simulation of a CCSN explosion. We ask whether the SDA procedure can use simulated flavor measurements at physically accessible locations (i.e. in vacuum) to determine the extent to which different matter density profiles through which the neutrinos propagate in the matter-dominated regime are compatible with these measurements. Within the scope of our small-scale model, we find that the neutrino flavor measurements in the vacuum regime are able to discriminate between different matter profiles, and we discuss implications regarding a future galactic CCSN detection.

 - **Abstract**
 This article presents the latest results of our ALMA program to study circumstellar disk characteristics as a function of orbital and stellar properties in a sample of young binary star systems known to host at least one disk. Optical and infrared observations of the eccentric, ~48-year period binary DF Tau indicated the presence of only one disk around the brighter component. However, our 1.3 mm ALMA thermal continuum maps show two nearly-equal brightness components in this system. We present these observations within the context of updated stellar and orbital properties which indicate that the inner disk of the secondary is absent. Because the two stars likely formed together, with the same composition, in the same environment, and at the same time, we expect their disks to be co-eval. However the absence of an inner disk around the secondary suggests uneven dissipation. We consider several processes which have the potential to accelerate inner disk evolution. Rapid inner disk dissipation has important implications for planet formation, particularly in the terrestrial-planet-forming region.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Star-forming regions are gaining considerable interest in the high-energy astrophysics community as possible Galactic particle accelerators. In general, the role of electrons has not been fully considered in this kind of cosmic-ray source. However, the intense radiation fields inside these regions might make electrons significant gamma-ray contributors. Aims. We study the young and compact star-forming region NGC 3603, a well known gamma-ray emitter. Our intention is to test whether its gamma-ray emission can be produced by cosmic-ray electrons. Methods. We build a novel model by creating realistic 3D distributions of the gas and the radiation field in the region. We introduce these models into PICARD to perform cosmic-ray transport simulations and produce gamma-ray emission maps. The results are compared with a dedicated Fermi Large Area Telescope data analysis at high energies. We also explore the radio and neutrino emissions of the system. Results. We improve the existing upper limits of the NGC 3603 gamma-ray source extension. Although the gamma-ray spectrum is well reproduced with the injection of CR protons, it requires nearly 30\% acceleration efficiency. In addition, the resulting extension of the simulated hadronic source is in mild tension with the extension data upper limit. The radio data disfavours the lepton-only scenario. Finally, combining both populations, the results are consistent with all observables, although the exact contributions are ambiguous.

 - **Abstract**
 We analysed microlensing data to uncover the nature of the anomaly that appeared near the peak of the short-timescale microlensing event KMT-2024-BLG-1044. Despite the anomaly's brief duration of less than a day, it was densely observed through high-cadence monitoring conducted by the KMTNet survey. Detailed modelling of the light curve confirmed the planetary origin of the anomaly and revealed two possible solutions, due to an inner--outer degeneracy. The two solutions provide different measured planet parameters: $(s, q)_{\rm inner} = [1.0883 \pm 0.0027, (3.125 \pm 0.248)\times 10^{-4}]$ for the inner solutions and $(s, q)_{\rm outer} = [1.0327 \pm 0.0054, (3.350 \pm 0.316)\times 10^{-4}]$ for the outer solutions. Using Bayesian analysis with constraints provided by the short event timescale ($t_{\rm E} \sim 9.1$~day) and the small angular Einstein radius ($\theta_{\rm E}\sim 0.16$~mas for the inner solution and $\sim 0.10$~mas for the outer solutio), we determined that the lens is a planetary system consisting of a host near the boundary between a star and a brown dwarf and a planet with a mass lower than that of Uranus. The discovery of the planetary system highlights the crucial role of the microlensing technique in detecting planets that orbit substellar brown dwarfs or very low-mass stars.

          Revisiting the Intrabinary Shock Model for Millisecond Pulsar Binaries: Radiative Losses and Long-Term Variability

 - **Abstract**
 Spectrally hard X-ray emission with double-peak light curves (LCs) and orbitally modulated gamma rays have been observed in some millisecond pulsar binaries, phenomena attributed to intrabinary shocks (IBSs). While the existing IBS model by Sim, An, and Wadiasingh (2024) successfully explains these high-energy features observed in three pulsar binaries, it neglects particle energy loss within the shock region. We refine this IBS model to incorporate radiative losses of X-ray emitting electrons and positrons, and verify that the losses have insignificant impact on the observed LCs and spectra of the three binaries. Applying our refined IBS model to the X-ray bright pulsar binary PSR J1723-2837, we predict that it can be detected by the Cherenkov Telescope Array. Additionally, we propose that the long-term X-ray variability observed in XSS J12270-4859 and PSR J1723-2837 is due to changes in the shape of their IBSs. Our modeling of the X-ray variability suggests that these IBS shape changes may alter the extinction of the companion's optical emission, potentially explaining the simultaneous optical and X-ray variability observed in XSS J12270-4859. We present the model results and discuss their implications.

 - **Abstract**
 Spatially homogeneous thermal equilibria of self-gravitating gas, being impossible otherwise, are nevertheless allowed in an expanding background accounting for Universe's expansion. Furthermore, a fixed density at the boundary of a perturbation is a natural boundary condition keeping the mass finite inside without the need to invoke any unphysical this http URL facts allow us to develop a consistent gravitational thermodynamics of isothermal spheres inside an expanding Universe. In the canonical and grand canonical ensembles we identify an instability for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous equilibria. We discuss a potential astrophysical application. If such an instability is triggered on baryonic gas at high redshift $z > 137$ when the primary baryonic component, namely atomic hydrogen, was still thermally locked to the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, then the corresponding destabilized gaseous clouds have baryonic mass $\geq 0.8\cdot 10^5 {\rm M}_\odot$ and radius $\geq 15{\rm pc}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The He II reionization epoch is expected to take place at $z\sim3-5$. In this stage, the helium and metals in the inter-galactic medium (IGM) are further ionized with additional contributions from harder non-stellar sources, and some large-scale gravitationally bound systems approach virialization. The "Probing the He II re-Ionization ERa via Absorbing C IV Historical Yield (HIERACHY)" program utilizes high- and medium-resolution spectra of bright background quasars at $z\approx3.9-5.2$ to investigate Ly$\alpha$, C IV, and other metal absorption lines during this epoch. Additionally, we employ narrow-band imaging to search for Ly$\alpha$ emitters associated with C IV absorbers, alongside multi-wavelength observations to identify and study particularly intriguing cases. In this paper, we present the design of the HIERACHY program, its current status, major scientific goals, and examples of initial data products from completed Magellan/MIKE, MagE spectroscopy, and MDM imaging observations. We also provide a brief outlook on future multi-wavelength observations that may significantly impact the related science.

 - **Abstract**
 The GPU-based High-order adaptive OpticS Testbench (GHOST) at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is a new 2-stage extreme adaptive optics (XAO) testbench at ESO. The GHOST is designed to investigate and evaluate new control methods (machine learning, predictive control) for XAO which will be required for instruments such as the Planetary Camera and Spectrograph of ESOs Extremely Large Telescope. The first stage corrections are performed in simulation, with the residual wavefront error at each iteration saved. The residual wavefront errors from the first stage are then injected into the GHOST using a spatial light modulator. The second stage correction is made with a Boston Michromachines Corporation 492 actuator deformable mirror and a pyramid wavefront sensor. The flexibility of the bench also opens it up to other applications, one such application is investigating the flip-flop modulation method for the pyramid wavefront sensor.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of massive stars is heavily influenced by their binarity, and the massive eccentric binary system MACHO 80.7443.1718 (ExtEV) serves as a prime example. This study explores whether the light variability of ExtEV, observed near the periastron during its 32.8-day orbit, can be explained by a wind-wind collision (WWC) model and reviews other potential explanations. Using broadband photometry, TESS data, ground-based $UBV$ time-series photometry, and high-resolution spectroscopy, we analysed the system's parameters. We ruled out the presence of a Keplerian disk and periodic Roche-lobe overflow. Our analysis suggests the primary component has a radius of about $30\,{\rm R}_\odot$, luminosity of $\sim6.6\times10^5\,{\rm L}_\odot$, and mass between $25$ and $45\,{\rm M}_\odot$, with a high wind mass-loss rate of $4.5\times10^{-5}\,{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, likely enhanced by tidal interactions, rotation, and tidally excited oscillations. We successfully modelled ExtEV's light curve, identifying atmospheric eclipse and light scattering in the WWC cone as key contributors. The system's mass-loss rate exceeds theoretical predictions, indicating that ExtEV is in a rare evolutionary phase, offering insights into enhanced mass loss in massive binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 HeH$^+$ was the first heteronuclear molecule to form in the metal-free Universe after the Big Bang. The molecule gained significant attention following its first circumstellar detection in the young and dense planetary nebula NGC 7027. We target some hydride ions associated with the noble gases (HeH$^+$, ArH$^+$, and NeH$^+$) to investigate their formation in a harsh environment like the novae outburst region. We use a photoionization modeling (based on the earlier published best-fitted physical parameters) of the moderately fast ONe type nova: QU Vulpeculae 1984 and CO type novae: RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii. Our steady-state modeling reveals a convincing amount of HeH$^+$, especially in the dense clump of RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii. The calculated upper limit of the surface brightness of HeH$^+$ transitions suggests that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could detect some of them, particularly in sources like RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii with similar physical and chemical conditions and evolution. It is to be clearly noted that the sources studied are used as templates, not as targets for observations. The detection of these lines could be useful for determining physical conditions in similar types of systems and validating our predictions based on new electron-impact rovibrational collisional data at temperatures up to 20,000 K.

          Planetesimal gravitational collapse in a gaseous environment: Thermal and dynamic evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Planetesimal formation models often invoke the gravitational collapse of pebble clouds to overcome various barriers to grain growth and propose processes to concentrate particles sufficiently to trigger this collapse. On the other hand, the geochemical approach for planet formation constrains the conditions for planetesimal formation and evolution by providing temperatures that should be reached to explain the final composition of planetesimals, the building blocks of planets. To elucidate the thermal evolution during gravitational collapse, we used numerical simulations of a self-gravitating cloud of particles and gas coupled with gas drag. Our goal is to determine how the gravitational energy relaxed during the contraction is distributed among the different energy components of the system, and how this constrains a thermal and dynamical planetesimal's history. We identify the conditions necessary to achieve a temperature increase of several hundred kelvins, and as much as 1600 K. Our results emphasise the key role of the gas during the collapse.

          The robustness of inferred envelope and core rotation rates of red-giant stars from asteroseismology

 - **Abstract**
 Rotation is an important, yet poorly-modelled phenomenon of stellar structure and evolution. Accurate estimates of internal rotation rates are therefore valuable for constraining stellar evolution models. We aim to assess the accuracy of asteroseismic estimates of internal rotation rates and how these depend on the fundamental stellar parameters. We apply the recently-developed method called extended-MOLA inversions to infer localised estimates of internal rotation rates of synthetic observations of red giants. We search for suitable reference stellar models following a grid-based approach, and assess the robustness of the resulting inferences to the choice of reference model. We find that matching the mixed mode pattern between the observation and the reference model is an important criterion to select suitable reference models. We propose to i) select a set of reference models based on the correlation between the observed rotational splittings and the mode-trapping parameter ii) compute rotation rates for all these models iii) use the mean value obtained across the whole set as the estimate of the internal rotation rates. We find that the effect of a near surface perturbation in the synthetic observations on the rotation rates estimated based on the correlation between the observed rotational splittings and the mode-trapping parameter is negligible. We conclude that when using an ensemble of reference models, constructed based on matching the mixed mode pattern, the input rotation rates can be recovered across a range of fundamental stellar parameters like mass, mixing-length parameter and composition. Further, red-giant rotation rates determined in this way are also independent of a near surface perturbation of stellar structure.

 The observational detection of some metastable isomers in the interstellar medium with abundances comparable to those of the most stable isomer, or even when the stable isomer is not detected, highlights the importance of non-equilibrium chemistry. This challenges our understanding of the interstellar chemistry. We present a chemical study of isomers through the sulphur isomer pair HNCS and HSCN, since HSCN has been observed in regions where its stable isomer has not been detected, and the observed HNCS/HSCN ratio seems to significantly vary from cold to warm regions. We have used the Nautilus chemical code to model the formation and destruction paths of HNCS and HSCN in different astrochemical scenarios, and the time evolution of the HNCS/HSCN ratio. We have also analysed the influence of the environmental conditions on their chemical abundances. We present an observational detection of the metastable isomer HSCN in the Class I object B1-a, but not of the stable isomer HNCS, despite HNCS lying 3200 K lower in energy than HSCN. Our results show an HNCS/HSCN ratio sensitive to the gas temperature and the evolutionary time, with the highest values obtained at early stages (t<10^4 yr) and low (Tg<20 K) temperatures. The results suggest a different efficiency of the isomerisation processes depending on the source temperature. The progressive decrease of HNCS/HSCN with gas temperature at early evolutionary times indicates that this ratio may be used as a tracer of cold young objects. This work also demonstrates the key role of grain surface chemistry in the formation of the isomer pair HNCS and HSCN in cold regions, and the importance of the ions H2NCS+ and HNCSH+ in warm/hot regions. Since most of the interstellar regions where HSCN is detected are cold regions, a larger sample including sources characterised by high temperatures are needed to corroborate the theoretical results.

 - **Abstract**
 Optical emission lines across the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) have been measured from multiple fields using the Australian National University (ANU) 2.3m telescope with the Wide-Field Spectrograph (WiFeS). Interpolated maps of the gas-phase metallicity, extinction, H$\alpha$ radial velocity and H$\alpha$ velocity dispersion have been made from these measurements. There is a metallicity gradient from the centre to the north of the galaxy of ~-0.095 dex/kpc with a shallower metallicity gradient from the centre to the south of the galaxy of ~-0.013 dex/kpc. There is an extinction gradient of ~-0.086 E(B-V)/kpc from the centre going north and shallower going from the centre to the south of ~-0.0089 E(B-V)/kpc. The SMC eastern arm has lower extinction than the main body. The radial velocity of the gas from the H$\alpha$ line and the HI line have been compared across the SMC. In general there is good agreement between the two measurements, though there are a few notable exceptions. Both show a region that has different radial velocity to the bulk motion of the SMC in the southern western corner by at least 16 kms$^{-1}$. The velocity dispersion from H$\alpha$ and HI across the SMC have also been compared, with the H$\alpha$ velocity dispersion usually the higher of the two. The eastern arm of the SMC generally has lower velocity dispersion than the SMC's main body. These measurements enable a detailed examination of the SMC, highlighting its nature as a disrupted satellite galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of the Galactic component of the high-energy neutrino flux, together with the detection of the diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission up to sub-PeV energies, open new possibilities to study the acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays in the Milky Way. At the same time, both large non-astrophysical backgrounds at TeV energies and scarcity of neutrino events in the sub-PeV band currently limit these analyses. Here we use the sample of cascade events with estimated neutrino energies above 200 TeV, detected by the partially deployed Baikal Gigaton Volume Detector (GVD) in six years of operation, to test the continuation of the Galactic neutrino spectrum to sub-PeV energies. We find that the distribution of the arrival directions of Baikal-GVD cascades above 200 TeV in the sky suggests an excess of neutrinos from low Galactic latitudes. We find the excess above 200 TeV also in the most recent IceCube public data sets, both of cascades and tracks. The significant (3.6 sigma in the combined analysis) flux of Galactic neutrinos above 200 TeV challenges often-used templates for neutrino search based on cosmic-ray simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Identified as parsec-size, gas clumps at the junction of multiple filaments, hub-filament systems (HFS) play a crucial role during the formation of young clusters and high-mass stars. These HFS appear nevertheless to be detached from most galactic filaments when compared in the mass-length (M-L) phase-space. We aim to characterize the early evolution of HFS as part of the filamentary description of the interstellar medium. Combining previous scaling relations with new analytic calculations, we created a toy model to explore the different physical regimes described by the M-L diagram. Despite its simplicity, our model accurately reproduces several observational properties reported for filaments and HFS such as their expected typical aspect ratio ($A$), mean surface density ($\Sigma$), and gas accretion rate ($\dot{m}$). Moreover, this model naturally explains the different mass and length regimes populated by filaments and HFS, respectively. Our model predicts a dichotomy between filamentary ($A\geq 3$) and spheroidal ($A<3$) structures connected to the relative importance of their fragmentation, accretion, and collapse timescales. Individual filaments with low accretion rates are dominated by an efficient internal fragmentation. In contrast, the formation of compact HFS at the intersection of filaments triggers a geometric phase-transition leading to the gravitational collapse of these structures at parsec-scales in $\sim$1Myr also inducing higher accretion rates.

 - **Abstract**
 There is a persistent $\sim 5 \sigma$ tension between the value of the Hubble constant, as derived from either the local distance ladder or the cosmic microwave background, signaling either unaccounted for systematics in the measurements or `new physics'. Determining the Hubble constant using Type Ia supernovae requires non-trivial and accurate corrections for dust extinction. To circumvent this obstacle, we here determine the Hubble constant from blue, and hence presumably unextinguished, supernovae, only. For two different compilations of Type Ia supernova data and lightcurve fitting methods we find that the derived Hubble constant is consistently lower by $\sim$ 3 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($\sim 70$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), and within 1 $\sigma$ of the Cosmic Microwave Background measurement, when using only blue supernovae as opposed to using all supernovae. Although the number of blue calibrating Type Ia supernovae is small, this indicates potential systematic effects in dust corrections in standard supernova cosmology. Upcoming major transient surveys will discover numerous unextinguished SNe~Ia, and thus be able to increase precision of the Hubble constant measured from blue SNe~Ia, heralding a promising path toward resolving the Hubble constant tension.

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 5139 ($\omega$ Cen), is the closest candidate of a Nuclear Star Cluster that has been stripped of its host galaxy in the Milky Way. Despite extensive studies through the last decades, many open questions about the cluster remain, including the properties of the binary population. In this study we use MUSE multi-epoch spectroscopy to identify binary systems in $\omega$ Cen. The observations span 8 years, with a total of 312 248 radial velocity measurements for 37 225 stars. Following the removal of known photometric variables, we identify 275 stars that show RV variations, corresponding to a discovery fraction of 1.4$\pm$0.1%. Using dedicated simulations, we find that our data is sensitive to 70$\pm$10% of the binaries expected in the sample, resulting in a completeness-corrected binary fraction of 2.1$\pm$0.4% in the central region of $\omega$ Cen. We find similar binary fractions for all stellar evolutionary stages covered by our data, the only notable exception being the blue straggler stars, which show an enhanced binary fraction. We also find no distinct correlation with distance from the cluster centre, indicating a limited amount of mass segregation within the half-light radius of $\omega$ Cen.

 - **Abstract**
 The innermost region of the Milky Way harbors the central molecular zone (CMZ). This region contains a large amount of molecular gas but a poor star formation rate considering the densities achieved by the gas in this region. We used the arepo code to perform a hydrodynamic and star formation simulation of the Galaxy, where a Ferrers bar was adiabatically introduced. During the stage of bar imposition, the bar strength excites density waves close to the inner Lindblad resonance guiding material toward the inner Galaxy, driving the formation of a ring that we qualitatively associate with the CMZ. During the simulation, we identified that the ring passes three main phases, namely: formation, instability, and quasi-stationary stages. During the whole evolution, and particularly in the quasi-stationary stage, we observe that the ring is associated with the x2 family of periodic orbits. Additionally, we found that most of the star formation occurs during the ring formation stage, while it drastically decreases in the instability stage. Finally, we found that when the gas has settled in a stable x2 orbit, the star formation takes place mostly after the dense gas passes the apocenter, triggering the conveyor-belt mechanism described in previous studies.

          A doublet of cosmological models to challenge the H0 tension in the Pantheon Supernovae Ia catalog

 - **Abstract**
 $\Lambda$CDM provides a leading framework in the interpretation of modern cosmology. Nevertheless, the scientific community still struggles with many open problems in cosmology. Among the most noticeable ones, the tension in the Hubble constant $H_0$ is particularly intriguing, prompting a wide range of possible solutions. In the present work, the flat scale-free cosmology ($S$CDM) of Maeder (2017) is tested for $H_0$ tension in fits to the Pantheon sample of Supernovae Ia. The Pantheon sample is a collection of 1048 SNe Ia, which formally defines $H_0=H(0)$ by extrapolation to redshift zero of data over positive redshifts $z>0$. Here, we consider $H_{0,k}$ in fits of $S$CDM over $k$ equally sized bins of sub-samples of mean redshift $z_k$. To quantify a trend in $H_{0,k}$ with $z_k$, the results are fit by $f(z)=H'_0/(1+z)^\alpha$ in the two parameters $H'_0$ and $\alpha$. This approach tests for model imperfections or data biases by trends that are inconsistent with zero. Our findings show a decreasing trend inconsistent with zero at $5.3 \sigma$ significance, significantly more so than in $\Lambda$CDM. These results are further confirmed in Pantheon+. It appears that a solution to $H_0$ tension is to be found in models with a deceleration parameter $q_0<q_{0,\Lambda}$ below that of $\Lambda$CDM, rather than $q_{0,\Lambda} < q_{0,S}<0$ satisfied by $S$CDM.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of complex organic molecules containing thiol ($-$SH) groups is essential in interstellar media because $-$SH plays an important role in the polymerization of amino acids (R-CH(NH$_{2}$)-COOH). Some quantum chemical studies have shown that there is a high chance of detecting the emission lines of dithioformic acid (HC(S)SH) in the highly dense and warm-inner regions of hot molecular cores and hot corinos. Therefore, we attempted to search for the emission lines of HC(S)SH toward the highly dense hot corino object NGC 1333 IRAS 4A using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 7. We present the first detection of the rotational emission lines of the trans-conformer of dithioformic acid (t-HC(S)SH) toward the NGC 1333 IRAS 4A2. The column density and excitation temperature of the t-HC(S)SH toward NGC 1333 IRAS 4A2 are (2.63$\pm$0.32)$\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ and 255$\pm$32 K, respectively. The fractional abundance of t-HC(S)SH with respect to H$_{2}$ is (2.53$\pm$0.68)$\times$10$^{-9}$. The column density ratio of t-HC(S)SH and t-HCOOH toward NGC 1333 IRAS 4A2 is 0.36$\pm$0.02. To understand the possible formation pathways of HC(S)SH, we computed a two-phase warm-up chemical model abundance of HC(S)SH using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM. After chemical modeling, we claim that HC(S)SH is formed in NGC 1333 IRAS 4A2 via barrierless radical--radical reactions between CSSH and H on the grain surfaces.
