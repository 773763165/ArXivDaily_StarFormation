#### No Dispersed Single Radio Pulses Detected in Archival Parkes Pulsar  Observations Targeting Supernova Remnants and Anomalous X-ray Pulsars
 - **Authors:** Fronefield Crawford

 - **Abstract**
 Four supernova remnants and four anomalous X-ray pulsars were previously observed with the Parkes telescope in a campaign to detect pulsed radio emission from associated neutron stars. No signals were detected in the original searches of these data. I have reprocessed the data with the more recently developed HEIMDALL and FETCH software packages, which are optimized for single-pulse detection and classification. In this new analysis, no astrophysical pulses were detected having a signal-to-noise ratio above 7 from any of the targets at dispersion measures ranging from 0 to $10^{4}$ pc cm$^{-3}$. I include calculated fluence limits on single radio pulses from these targets.
#### A Blind Search for Transit Depth Variability with TESS

 - **Abstract**
 The phenomenon of transit depth variability offers a pathway through which processes such as exoplanet atmospheric activity and orbital dynamics can be studied. In this work we conduct a blind search for transit depth variations among 330 known planets observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) within its first four years of operation. Through an automated periodogram analysis, we identify four targets (KELT-8b, HAT-P-7b, HIP 65Ab, and TrES-3b) which appear to show significant transit depth variability. We find that KELT-8b's transit depth variability likely comes from contaminating flux from a nearby star, while HIP 65Ab and TrES-3b's apparent variability are probable artifacts due to their grazing orbits. HAT-P-7b indicates signs of variability that possibly originate from the planet or its host star. A population-level analysis does not reveal any significant correlation between transit depth variability and host star effective temperature and mass; such correlation could arise if stellar activity was the cause of depth variations via the Transit Light Source effect. Extrapolating our ~1% detection rate to the upcoming Roman mission, predicted to yield of order 100,000 transiting planets, we expect that ~1,000 of these targets will be found to exhibit significant transit depth variability.
#### Recurring Activity Discovered on Quasi-Hilda 2009 DQ118

 - **Abstract**
 We have discovered two epochs of activity on quasi-Hilda 2009 DQ118. Small bodies that display comet-like activity, such as active asteroids and active quasi-Hildas, are important for understanding the distribution of water and other volatiles throughout the solar system. Through our NASA Partner Citizen Science project, Active Asteroids, volunteers classified archival images of 2009 DQ118 as displaying comet-like activity. By performing an in-depth archival image search, we found over 20 images from UT 2016 March 8--9 with clear signs of a comet-like tail. We then carried out follow-up observations of 2009 DQ118 using the 3.5 m Astrophysical Research Consortium Telescope at Apache Point Observatory, Sunspot, New Mexico, USA and the 6.5 m Magellan Baade Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile. These images revealed a second epoch of activity associated with the UT 2023 April 22 perihelion passage of 2009 DQ118. We performed photometric analysis of the tail and find that it had a similar apparent length and surface brightness during both epochs. We also explored the orbital history and future of 2009 DQ118 through dynamical simulations. These simulations show that 2009 DQ118 is currently a quasi-Hilda and that it frequently experiences close encounters with Jupiter. We find that 2009 DQ118 is currently on the boundary between asteroidal and cometary orbits. Additionally, it has likely been a Jupiter family comet or Centaur for much of the past 10 kyr and will be in these same regions for the majority of the next 10 kyr. Since both detected epochs of activity occurred near perihelion, the observed activity is consistent with sublimation of volatile ices. 2009 DQ118 is currently observable until ~mid-October 2023. Further observations would help to characterize the observed activity.
#### Stellar properties of an actively accreting Algol-type eclipsing binary  2M16212643+2136590

 - **Abstract**
 Interacting binary stars undergo evolution that is significantly different from single stars, thus, a larger sample of such systems with precisely determined stellar parameters is needed to understand the complexities of this process. We present an analysis of a hierarchical triple containing a spectroscopically double-lined eclipsing binary, 2M16+21. Our calculations show that this system has undergone significant mass transfer, with the current mass and radius of the donor of 0.33 Msun and 2.55 Rsun, as well as the accretor of 1.37 Msun and 2.20 Rsun, resulting in a mass ratio of 4.2. Despite the already significant mass loss from the donor, shedding well over half its initial gas, mass transfer remains active. The shock from the accretion has produced a spot on the surface of the accretor that is ~2 times hotter than the photosphere, reaching temperatures of ~10,000 K and producing significant UV excess. This shock temperature is comparable to what is seen in the pre-main sequence stars that undergo active accretion. The compactness of the hot spot of just ~2 deg is one of the smallest observed in systems exhibiting binary mass transfer, pointing to the recency of its formation, as such it can be used to explicitly trace the point of impact of the accretion stream. The donor of this system may be a sub-sub-giant; comparing it with systems with similar initial conditions may help with understanding the formation processes of such stars.
#### Ly$α$NNA: A Deep Learning Field-level Inference Machine for the  Lyman-$α$ Forest

 - **Abstract**
 The inference of astrophysical and cosmological properties from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest conventionally relies on summary statistics of the transmission field that carry useful but limited information. We present a deep learning framework for inference from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest at field-level. This framework consists of a 1D residual convolutional neural network (ResNet) that extracts spectral features and performs regression on thermal parameters of the IGM that characterize the power-law temperature-density relation. We train this supervised machinery using a large set of mock absorption spectra from Nyx hydrodynamic simulations at $z=2.2$ with a range of thermal parameter combinations (labels). We employ Bayesian optimization to find an optimal set of hyperparameters for our network, and then employ a committee of ten neural networks for increased statistical robustness of the network inference. In addition to the parameter point predictions, our machine also provides a self-consistent estimate of their covariance matrix with which we construct a pipeline for inferring the posterior distribution of the parameters. We compare the results of our framework with the traditional summary (PDF and power spectrum of transmission) based approach in terms of the area of the 68% credibility regions as our figure of merit (FoM). In our study of the information content of perfect (noise- and systematics-free) Ly$\alpha$ forest spectral data-sets, we find a significant tightening of the posterior constraints -- factors of 5.65 and 1.71 in FoM over power spectrum only and jointly with PDF, respectively -- that is the consequence of recovering the relevant parts of information that are not carried by the classical summary statistics.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the perturbations in the temperature (and density) distribution for 28 clusters selected from the CHEX-MATE sample to evaluate and characterize the level of inhomogeneities and the related dynamical state of the ICM. We use these spatially resolved 2D distributions to measure the global and radial scatter and identify the regions that deviate the most from the average distribution. During this process, we introduce three dynamical state estimators and produce clean temperature profiles after removing the most deviant regions. We find that the temperature distribution of most of the clusters is skewed towards high temperatures and is well described by a log-normal function. There is no indication that the number of regions deviating more than 1$\sigma$ from the azimuthal value is correlated with the dynamical state inferred from morphological estimators. The removal of these regions leads to local temperature variations up to 10-20% and an average increase of $\sim$5% in the overall cluster temperatures. The measured relative intrinsic scatter within $R_{500}$, $\sigma_{T,int}/T$, has values of 0.17$^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$, and is almost independent of the cluster mass and dynamical state. Comparing the scatter of temperature and density profiles to hydrodynamic simulations, we constrain the average Mach number regime of the sample to $M_{3D}$=0.36$^{+0.16}_{-0.09}$. We infer the ratio between the energy in turbulence and the thermal energy, and translate this ratio in terms of a predicted hydrostatic mass bias $b$, estimating an average value of $b\sim$0.11 (covering a range between 0 and 0.37) within $R_{500}$. This study provides detailed temperature fluctuation measurements for 28 CHEX-MATE clusters which can be used to study turbulence, derive the mass bias, and make predictions on the scaling relation properties.
#### Including Neutrino-driven Convection into the Force Explosion Condition  to Predict Explodability of Multi-dimensional Core-collapse Supernovae (FEC+)

 - **Abstract**
 Most massive stars end their lives with core collapse. However, it is not clear which explode as a Core-collapse Supernova (CCSN), leaving behind a neutron star and which collapse to black hole, aborting the explosion. One path to predict explodability without expensive multi-dimensional simulations is to develop analytic explosion conditions. These analytic explosion conditions also provide a deeper understanding of the explosion mechanism and they provide some insight as to why some simulations explode and some do not. The analytic force explosion condition (FEC) reproduces the explosion conditions of spherically symmetric CCSN simulations. In this followup manuscript, we include the dominant multi-dimensional effect that aids explosion, neutrino driven convection, into the FEC. This generalized critical condition (FEC+) is suitable for multi-dimensional simulations and has potential to accurately predict explosion conditions of two- and three-dimensional CCSN simulations. We show that adding neutrino-driven convection reduces the critical condition by $\sim 30\%$, which is consistent with previous multi-dimensional simulations.
#### ALMA Observations of Supernova Remnant N49 in the Large Magellanic  Cloud. II. Non-LTE Analysis of Shock-heated Molecular Clouds

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first compelling evidence of shock-heated molecular clouds associated with the supernova remnant (SNR) N49 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Using $^{12}$CO($J$ = 2-1, 3-2) and $^{13}$CO($J$ = 2-1) line emission data taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, we derived the H$_2$ number density and kinetic temperature of eight $^{13}$CO-detected clouds using the large velocity gradient approximation at a resolution of 3.5$''$ (~0.8 pc at the LMC distance). The physical properties of the clouds are divided into two categories: three of them near the shock front show the highest temperatures of ~50 K with densities of ~500-700 cm$^{-3}$, while other clouds slightly distant from the SNR have moderate temperatures of ~20 K with densities of ~800-1300 cm$^{-3}$. The former clouds were heated by supernova shocks, but the latter were dominantly affected by the cosmic-ray heating. These findings are consistent with the efficient production of X-ray recombining plasma in N49 due to thermal conduction between the cold clouds and hot plasma. We also find that the gas pressure is roughly constant except for the three shock-engulfed clouds inside or on the SNR shell, suggesting that almost no clouds have evaporated within the short SNR age of ~4800 yr. This result is compatible with the shock-interaction model with dense and clumpy clouds inside a low-density wind bubble.

 - **Abstract**
 This report first describes the status quo regarding the emerging deployment of very large groups of low-Earth-orbit satellites in the late 2010s, the concerns raised by the international astronomy community, and steps the community took to address the issue. We then describe the results of a series of four conferences held in 2020-21 that considered the impacts of large satellite constellations as it impacted a number of stakeholders, and how those outcomes resulted in the establishment of both the IAU Centre for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from Satellite Constellation Interference (IAU CPS) and its Community Engagement (CE) Hub. We finish with a brief description of CE Hub's initial plans and activities, flowing from the recommendations of those conferences.

 - **Abstract**
 The Hubble diagram (HD) is a plot that contains luminous distance modulus presented with respect to the redshift. The distance modulus--redshift relation of the most well-known ``standard candles'', the type Ia supernovae (SN), is a crucial tool in cosmological model testing. In this work, we use the SN Ia data from the Pantheon catalogue to calibrate the Swift long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) as ``standard candles'' via the Amati relation. Thus, we expand the HD from supernovae to the area of the Swift LGRBs up to $z\sim8$. To improve the quality of estimation of the parameters and their errors, we implement the Monte-Carlo uncertainty propagation method. We also compare the results of estimation of the Amati parameters calibrated by the SN Ia, and by the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and find no statistically significant distinguish between them. Although the size of our LGRB sample is relatively small and the errors are high, we find this approach of expanding the cosmological distance scale perspective for future cosmological tests.

#### Quasi-simultaneous Optical Flux and Polarization Variability of the  Binary Super Massive Black Hole Blazar OJ 287 from 2015 to 2023: Detection of  an Anticorrelation in Flux and Polarization Variability

 - **Abstract**
 We study the optical flux and polarization variability of the binary black hole blazar OJ 287 using quasi-simultaneous observations from 2015 to 2023 carried out using telescopes in the USA, Japan, Russia, Crimea, and Bulgaria. This is one of the most extensive quasi-simultaneous optical flux and polarization variability studies of OJ 287. OJ 287 showed large amplitude, ~3.0 mag flux variability, large changes of ~37% in degree of polarization, and a large swing of ~215 degrees in the angle of the electric vector of polarization. During the period of observation, several flares in flux were detected. Those flares are correlated with a rapid increase in the degree of polarization and swings in electric vector of polarization angle. A peculiar behavior of anticorrelation between flux and polarization degree, accompanied by a nearly constant polarization angle, was detected from JD 2,458,156 to JD 2,458,292. We briefly discuss some explanations for the flux and polarization variations observed in OJ 287.
#### Multi-band Cross-correlated Radio Variability of the Blazar 3C 279

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of our study of cross-correlations between long-term multi-band observations of the radio variability of the blazar 3C 279. More than a decade (2008-2022) of radio data were collected at seven different frequencies ranging from 2 GHz to 230 GHz. The multi-band radio light curves show variations in flux, with the prominent flare features appearing first at higher-frequency and later in lower-frequency bands. This behavior is quantified by cross-correlation analysis, which finds that the emission at lower-frequency bands lags that at higher-frequency bands. Lag versus frequency plots are well fit by straight lines with negative slope, typically ~-30 day/GHz. We discuss these flux variations in conjunction with the evolution of bright moving knots seen in multi-epoch VLBA maps to suggest possible physical changes in the jet that can explain the observational results. Some of the variations are consistent with the predictions of shock models, while others are better explained by a changing Doppler beaming factor as the knot trajectory bends slightly, given a small viewing angle to the jet.
#### Pre-impulsive and Impulsive Phases of the Sub-Terahertz Flare of March  28, 2022

 - **Abstract**
 Properties of the solar radio spectrum, as well as the temporal profiles of flare emission, indicate the thermal nature of the sub-terahertz (sub-THz) component observed as the growth of radio emission in the frequency range of 100-1000 GHz. The sub-THz flare onset can be ahead of the impulsive phase for several minutes. However, the origin of the pre-impulsive and impulsive sub-THz emission remains unclear. The present work is devoted to a detailed analysis of the M4.0 X-class solar flare observed on March 28, 2022 with the Bauman Moscow State Technical University Radio Telescope RT-7.5 at 93 GHz. We supply these data with multiwavelength solar observations in the X-ray (GOES, GBM/Fermi), extreme ultraviolet (AIA/SDO), and microwave ranges. The differential emission measure (DEM) responsible for EUV emission is determined by solving the inverse problem based on the AIA/SDO data. Using the DEM and assuming a thermal free-free emission mechanism in pre-impulsive and impulsive phases, we calculated the millimeter emission flux of coronal plasma of the flare source, which turned out to be much smaller than the observed values. We concluded that electrons accelerated in the corona and heat fluxes from the coronal loop top cannot be responsible for heating the sub-THz emission source located in the transition region and upper chromosphere. A possible origin of chromospheric heating in the pre-impulsive phase of the solar flare is discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The geometries of near-resonant planetary systems offer a relatively pristine window into the initial conditions of exoplanet systems. Given that near-resonant systems have likely experienced minimal dynamical disruptions, the spin-orbit orientations of these systems inform the typical outcomes of quiescent planet formation, as well as the primordial stellar obliquity distribution. However, few measurements have been made to constrain the spin-orbit orientations of near-resonant systems. We present a Rossiter-McLaughlin measurement of the near-resonant warm Jupiter TOI-2202 b, obtained using the Carnegie Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS) on the 6.5m Magellan Clay Telescope. This is the eighth result from the Stellar Obliquities in Long-period Exoplanet Systems (SOLES) survey. We derive a sky-projected 2D spin-orbit angle $\lambda=26^{+12}_{-15}$ $^{\circ}$ and a 3D spin-orbit angle $\psi=31^{+13}_{-11}$ $^{\circ}$, finding that TOI-2202 b - the most massive near-resonant exoplanet with a 3D spin-orbit constraint to date - likely deviates from exact alignment with the host star's equator. Incorporating the full census of spin-orbit measurements for near-resonant systems, we demonstrate that the current set of near-resonant systems with period ratios $P_2/P_1\lesssim4$ is generally consistent with a quiescent formation pathway, with some room for low-level ($\lesssim20^{\circ}$) protoplanetary disk misalignments or post-disk-dispersal spin-orbit excitation. Our result constitutes the first population-wide analysis of spin-orbit geometries for near-resonant planetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The multi-drifting subpulse behaviors in PSR J2007+0910 have been studied carefully with the high sensitivity observations of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) at 1250 MHz. We found that there are at least six different single emission modes in PSR J2007+0910 are observed, four of which show significant subpulse drifting behaviors (modes A, B, C, and D), and the remaining two (modes $E_1$ and $E_2$) show stationary subpulse structures. The subpulse drifting periods of modes A, B, C, and D are $P_{3, A} = 8.7 \pm 1.6 P$, $P_{3, B} = 15.8 \pm 1.2 P$, $P_{3, C} = 21.6 \pm 1.3 P$ and $P_{3, D} = 32.3 \pm 0.9 P$, respectively, where $P$ represents the pulse period of this pulsar. The subpulse separation is almost the same for all modes $P_2 = 6.01 \pm 0.18 ^\circ$. Deep analysis suggests that the appearance and significant changes in the drifting period of multi-drifting subpulse emission modes for a pulsar may originate from the aliasing effect. The observed non-drifting modes may be caused by the spark point move with a period ~P_2. Our statistical analysis shows that the drift mode of this pulsar almost always switches from slower to faster drifts in the mode change. The interesting subpulse emission phenomenon of PSR J2007+0910 provides a unique opportunity to understand the switching mechanism of multi-drift mode.

 - **Abstract**
 In high-energy astrophysical processes involving compact objects, such as core-collapse supernovae or binary neutron star mergers, neutrinos play an important role in the synthesis of nuclides. Neutrinos in these environments can experience collective flavor oscillations driven by neutrino-neutrino interactions, including coherent forward scattering and incoherent (collisional) effects. Recently, there has been interest in exploring potential novel behaviors in collective oscillations of neutrinos by going beyond the one-particle effective or "mean-field" treatments. Here, we seek to explore implications of collective neutrino oscillations, in the mean-field treatment and beyond, for the nucleosynthesis yields in supernova environments with different astrophysical conditions and neutrino inputs. We find that collective oscillations can impact the operation of the {\nu}p-process and r-process nucleosynthesis in supernovae. The potential impact is particularly strong in high-entropy, proton-rich conditions, where we find that neutrino interactions can nudge an initial {\nu}p process neutron rich, resulting in a unique combination of proton-rich low-mass nuclei as well as neutron-rich high-mass nuclei. We describe this neutrino-induced neutron capture process as the "{\nu}i process". In addition, nontrivial quantum correlations among neutrinos, if present significantly, could lead to different nuclide yields compared to the corresponding mean-field oscillation treatments, by virtue of modifying the evolution of the relevant one-body neutrino observables.

 The pyramid wavefront sensor (PyWFS) has become increasingly popular to use in adaptive optics (AO) systems due to its high sensitivity. The main drawback of the PyWFS is that it is inherently nonlinear, which means that classic linear wavefront reconstruction techniques face a significant reduction in performance at high wavefront errors, particularly when the pyramid is unmodulated. In this paper, we consider the potential use of neural networks (NNs) to replace the widely used matrix vector multiplication (MVM) control. We aim to test the hypothesis that the neural network (NN)'s ability to model nonlinearities will give it a distinct advantage over MVM control. We compare the performance of a MVM linear reconstructor against a dense NN, using daytime data acquired on the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics system (SCExAO) instrument. In a first set of experiments, we produce wavefronts generated from 14 Zernike modes and the PyWFS responses at different modulation radii (25, 50, 75, and 100 mas). We find that the NN allows for a far more precise wavefront reconstruction at all modulations, with differences in performance increasing in the regime where the PyWFS nonlinearity becomes significant. In a second set of experiments, we generate a dataset of atmosphere-like wavefronts, and confirm that the NN outperforms the linear reconstructor. The SCExAO real-time computer software is used as baseline for the latter. These results suggest that NNs are well positioned to improve upon linear reconstructors and stand to bring about a leap forward in AO performance in the near future.

 AI and deep learning techniques are beginning to play an increasing role in astronomy as a necessary tool to deal with the data avalanche. Here we describe an application for finding resolved Planetary Nebulae (PNe) in crowded, wide-field, narrow-band H-alpha survey imagery in the Galactic plane. PNe are important to study late stage of stellar evolution of low to intermediate-mass stars. However, the confirmed ~3800 Galactic PNe fall far short of the numbers expected. Traditional visual searching for resolved PNe is time-consuming due to the large data size and areal coverage of modern astronomical surveys, especially those taken in narrow-band filters highlighting emission nebulae. To test and facilitate more objective, reproducible, efficient and reliable trawls for PNe candidates we have developed a new, deep learning algorithm. In this paper, we applied the algorithm to several H-alpha digital surveys (e.g. IPHAS and VPHAS+). The training and validation dataset was built with true PNe from the HASH database. After transfer learning, it was then applied to the VPHAS+ survey. We examined 979 out of 2284 survey fields with each survey field covering 1 * 1 deg^2. With a sample of 454 PNe from the IPHAS as our validation set, our algorithm correctly identified 444 of these objects (97.8%), with only 16 explicable 'false' positives. Our model returned ~20,000 detections, including 2637 known PNe and many other kinds of catalogued non-PNe such as HII regions. A total of 815 new high-quality PNe candidates were found, 31 of which were selected as top-quality targets for subsequent optical spectroscopic follow-up. Representative preliminary confirmatory spectroscopy results are presented here to demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques with full details to be given in paper-II.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe two fitting schemes that aim to represent the high-density part of realistic equations of state for numerical simulations such as neutron star oscillations. The low-density part of the equation of state is represented by an arbitrary polytropic crust, and we propose a generic procedure to stitch any desired crust to the high-density fit, which is performed on the internal energy, pressure and sound speed of barotropic equations of state that describe cold neutron stars in $\beta$-equilibrium. An extension of the fitting schemes to equations of state with an additional compositional parameter is proposed. In particular we develop a formalism that ensures the existence of a $\beta$-equilibrium at low densities. An additional feature of this low-density model is that it can be, in principle, applied to any parametrization. The performance of the fits is checked on mass, radius and tidal deformability as well as on the dynamical radial oscillation frequencies. To that end, we use a pseudospectral isolated neutron star evolution code based on a non-conservative form of the hydrodynamical equations. A comparison to existing parametrizations is proposed, as far as possible, and to published radial frequency values in the literature. The static and dynamic quantities are well reproduced by the fitting schemes. Our results suggest that, even though the radius is very sensitive to the choice of the crust, this choice has little influence on the oscillation frequencies of a neutron star.

 - **Abstract**
 The tidal love number determines a star's deformability rate in the presence of gravitational potential and depends on the star's internal structure. In this work, we investigate two significant prospects on tidal love number : (i) the influence of the polytropic index of stars on the tidal love number and , (ii) how tidal love number affects the pericenter shift of S-stars near Sgr A* which is an important probe for strong-field tests of gravitational theories. We consider S-stars orbiting Sgr A* at a pericenter distance of 45 au to 500 au, well below the S-2 orbit. The S-stars have polytropic indices of the range, n = 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, and 4.5, and eccentricity, e = 0.9 inclined at $i=90 ^{\circ}$. The tidal love number is estimated for multipole moments $l=2$ and $l=3$. It has been found that the tidal love number decreases as the polytropic index increases. Additionally, the tidal love number for the multipole moment of $l=2$ is dominant over that of $l=3$. The tidal distortion effect also causes a greater pericenter shift in compact orbit S-stars with lower polytropic indices and tidal love number having multipole moment $l=2$. The estimated results offer relevant insights for testing general relativity and its alternative theories in the vicinity of Sgr A*

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decades, libraries of stellar spectra have been used in a large variety of science cases, including as sources of reference spectra for a given object or a given spectral type. Despite the existence of large libraries and the increasing number of projects of large-scale spectral surveys, there is to date only one very high-resolution spectral library offering spectra from a few hundred objects from the southern hemisphere (UVES-POP) . We aim to extend the sample, offering a finer coverage of effective temperatures and surface gravity with a uniform collection of spectra obtained in the northern hemisphere. Between 2010 and 2020, we acquired several thousand echelle spectra of bright stars with the Mercator-HERMES spectrograph located in the Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory in La Palma, whose pipeline offers high-quality data reduction products. We have also developed methods to correct for the instrumental response in order to approach the true shape of the spectral continuum. Additionally, we have devised a normalisation process to provide a homogeneous normalisation of the full spectral range for most of the objects. We present a new spectral library consisting of 3256 spectra covering 2043 stars. It combines high signal-to-noise and high spectral resolution over the entire range of effective temperatures and luminosity classes. The spectra are presented in four versions: raw, corrected from the instrumental response, with and without correction from the atmospheric molecular absorption, and normalised (including the telluric correction).

 - **Abstract**
 This study proposes a novel parametrization approach for the dimensionless Hubble parameter i.e. $E^2(z)=A(z)+\beta (1+\gamma B(z))$ in the context of scalar field dark energy models. The parameterization is characterized by two functions, $A(z)$ and $B(z)$, carefully chosen to capture the behavior of the Hubble parameter at different redshifts. We explore the evolution of cosmological parameters, including the deceleration parameter, density parameter, and equation of state parameter. Observational data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and the Pantheon+ datasets are analyzed using MCMC methodology to determine model parameters. The results are compared with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model using the Planck observations. Our approach provides a model-independent exploration of dark energy, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of late-time cosmic acceleration.

 - **Abstract**
 The primordial black holes (PBHs) formation in the early universe inflationary cosmology has received a lot of attention in recent years. One of the ways PBHs formation can be a possibility is the preheating stage after inflation and this particular scenario does not require any ad-hoc fine tuning of the scalar field potential. In this paper, we focus on the growth of primordial density perturbation and the consequent possibility of PBHs formation in the preheating stage of the Starobinsky model for inflation. The typical mechanism for PBH formation during preheating is based on the collapse of primordial fluctuations that become super-horizon during inflation (type I) and re-enter the particle horizon in the different phases of cosmic expansion. In this work, we show that there exists a certain range of modes that remain in the sub-horizon (not exited) during inflation (type II modes). Those can, in the later phase of evolution, lead to large density perturbation above the threshold and can potentially also contribute to the PBH formation. We obtain in detail the conditions that determine the possible collapse of type I and/or type II modes. Since the preheating stage is an 'inflaton' (approximately) matter-dominated phase with the equation of state $w\ll 1$, we follow the framework of the critical collapse of fluctuations and compute the mass fraction using the well-known Press-Schechter and the Khlopov-Polnarev formalisms, and compare the two. Finally, we comment on the implications of our study for the investigations concerned with primordial accretion and consequent PBH contribution to the dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 The large combined field of view of the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) instruments onboard the GOES weather satellites makes them useful for studying the population of other atmospheric phenomena, such as bolides. Being a lightning mapper, GLM has many detection biases when applied to non-lightning and these systematics must be studied and properly accounted for before precise measurements of bolide flux can be ascertained. We developed a Bayesian Poisson regression model which simultaneously estimates instrumental biases and our statistic of principal interest: the latitudinal variation of bolide flux. We find that the estimated bias due to the angle of incident light upon the instrument corresponds roughly with the known sensitivity of the GLM instruments. We compare our latitudinal flux variation estimates to existing theoretical models and find our estimates consistent with GLM being strongly biased towards high-velocity bolides.

 - **Abstract**
 The Q&U Bolometric Interferometer for Cosmology (QUBIC) is the first bolometric interferometer designed to measure the primordial B-mode polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Bolometric interferometry is a novel technique that combines the sensitivity of bolometric detectors with the control of systematic effects that is typical of interferometry, both key features in the quest for the faint signal of the primordial B-modes. A unique feature is the so-called "spectral imaging", i.e., the ability to recover the sky signal in several sub-bands within the physical band during data analysis. This feature provides an in-band spectral resolution of \Delta{\nu}/{\nu} \sim 0.04 that is unattainable by a traditional imager. This is a key tool for controlling the Galactic foregrounds contamination. In this paper, we describe the principles of bolometric interferometry, the current status of the QUBIC experiment and future prospects.

 - **Abstract**
 Type-I X-ray bursts are rapid-brightening transient phenomena on the surfaces of accreting neutron stars (NSs). Some X-ray bursts, called {\it clocked bursters}, exhibit regular behavior with similar light curve profiles in their burst sequences. The periodic nature of clocked bursters has the advantage of constraining X-ray binary parameters and physics inside the NS. In the present study, we compute numerical models, based on different equations of state and NS masses, which are compared with the observation of a recently identified clocked burster, 1RXS J180408.9$-$342058. We find that the relation between accretion rate and recurrence time is highly sensitive to the NS mass and radius. We determine, in particular, that 1RXS J180408.9$-$342058 appears to possess a mass less than $1.7M_{\odot}$ and favors a stiffer nuclear equation of state (with an NS radius $\gtrsim12.7{\rm km}$). Consequently, the observations of this new clocked burster may provide additional constraints for probing the structure of NSs.

 We take a fresh look at about 60 years of recommendations for US federal funding for astronomical and astrophysical facilities provided by seven survey committees at roughly 10-year intervals. It remains true that very roughly one third of the highest priority items were done with (mostly) federal funding within about 15 years of the reports; another third happened with (mostly) state, private, or international funding; and about a third never happened (and we might well not want them now). Some other very productive facilities were never quite recommended but entered the queue in other ways. We also take brief looks at the long-term achievements of the highest-priority facilities that were actually funded and built more or less as described in the decadal reports. We end with a very brief look at the gender balance of the various panels and committees and mention some broader issues that came to look important while we were collecting the primary data. A second paper will look at what sorts of institutions the panel and committee members have come from over the years.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years the focus of exoplanet research has shifted from the mere detection to detailed characterization. Precise measurements of the masses and radii of transiting planets have shown that some low-mass planets have extended atmospheres while others are bare rocks. Hybrid atmospheres consisting of a mixture of Hydrogen and large amount of heavy elements have also been detected. A key factor in explaining this diversity of planetary atmospheres is the erosion by the X-ray and EUV-radiation (XUV) from the host-star. The evaporation through XUV-radiation has already been measured for a few exoplanets.The apparent weakness of the CaIIHK and the MgIIhk emission cores has been interpreted as evidence for the evaporation of planetary atmospheres. The interpretation is that the evaporating material from the planet forms a thick torus which absorbs the C,IIHK and the MgIIhk lines from the host star. In this contribution a new way how to prove, or disprove this hypothesis by observations is proposed. It is furthermore shown that there are enough bright targets are already known that can be observed, and more will be found with the PLATO mission.

 - **Abstract**
 The largest bodies - or dwarf planets - constitute a different class among Kuiper belt objects and are characterised by bright surfaces and volatile compositions remarkably different from that of smaller trans-Neptunian objects. These compositional differences are also reflected in the visible and near-infrared colours, and variegations across the surface can cause broadband colours to vary with rotational phase. Here we present near-infrared J and H-band observations of the dwarf planet (136199) Eris obtained with the GuideDog camera of the Infrared Telescope Facility. These measurements show that - as suspected from previous J-H measurements - the J-H colour of Eris indeed varies with rotational phase. This suggests notable surface heterogenity in chemical composition and/or other material properties despite the otherwise quite homogeneous, high albedo surface, characterised by a very low amplitude visible range light curve. While variations in the grain size of the dominant CH4 may in general be responsible for notable changes in the J-H colour, in the current observing geometry of the system it can only partially explain the observed J-H variation.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars display multi-periodic variability in the gravito-inertial mode regime with indications of non-linear resonances between modes. Several have undergone asteroseismic modeling in the past few years to infer their internal properties in a linear setting. Rotation is typically included in the modeling by means of the traditional approximation of rotation (TAR). Aims. We aim to extend the set of tools available for asteroseismology, by describing time-independent (stationary) resonant non-linear coupling among three gravito-inertial modes within the TAR. Such coupling offers the opportunity to use mode amplitude ratios in the asteroseismic modeling process, instead of only relying on frequencies of linear eigenmodes. Methods. Following observational detections, we derive expressions for the resonant stationary non-linear coupling between three gravito-inertial modes in rotating stars. We assess selection rules and stability domains for stationary solutions and predict non-linear frequencies and amplitude ratio observables that can be compared with their observed counterparts. Results. Most of the non-linear frequency shifts are negligible compared to typical frequency errors derived from observations. The theoretically predicted amplitude ratios of combination frequencies match with some of their observational counterparts in the SPB targets. Other observed ratios could be linked to other saturation mechanisms, to interactions between different modes, or to different opacity gradients in the driving zone. Conclusions. Our non-linear mode coupling formalism can explain some of the stationary amplitude ratios of observed resonant mode couplings in single SPB stars monitored during 4 years by Kepler.

 - **Abstract**
 Modeling the multiwavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of blazars provides key insights into the underlying physical processes responsible for the emission. While SED modeling with self-consistent models is computationally demanding, it is essential for a comprehensive understanding of these astrophysical objects. We introduce a novel, efficient method for modeling the SEDs of blazars by the mean of a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this paper, we trained the CNN on a leptonic model that incorporates synchrotron and inverse Compton emissions, as well as self-consistent electron cooling and pair creation-annihilation processes. The CNN is capable of reproducing the radiative signatures of blazars with high accuracy. This approach significantly reduces computational time, thereby enabling real-time fitting to multi-wavelength datasets. As a demonstration, we used the trained CNN with MultiNest to fit the broadband SEDs of Mrk 421 and 1ES 1959+650, successfully obtaining their parameter posterior distributions. This novel framework for fitting the SEDs of blazars will be further extended to incorporate more sophisticated models based on external Compton and hadronic scenarios, allowing for multi-messenger constraints in the analysis. The models will be made publicly available via a web interface, the Markarian Multiwavelength Datacenter, to facilitate self-consistent modeling of multi-messenger data from blazar observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Measurement of the redshifted 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen from the Cosmic Dawn (CD) and Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) promises to unveil a wealth of information about the astrophysical processes during the first billion years of evolution of the universe. The AARTFAAC Cosmic Explorer (ACE) utilises the AARTFAAC wide-field imager of LOFAR to measure the power spectrum of the intensity fluctuations of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the CD at z~18. The RFI from various sources contaminates the observed data and it is crucial to exclude the RFI-affected data in the analysis for reliable detection. In this work, we investigate the impact of non-ground-based transient RFI using cross-power spectra and cross-coherence metrics to assess the correlation of RFI over time and investigate the level of impact of transient RFI on the ACE 21-cm power spectrum estimation. We detected moving sky-based transient RFI sources that cross the field of view within a few minutes and appear to be mainly from aeroplane communication beacons at the location of the LOFAR core in the 72-75 MHz band, by inspecting filtered images. This transient RFI is mostly uncorrelated over time and is only expected to dominate over the thermal noise for an extremely deep integration time of 3000 hours or more with a hypothetical instrument that is sky temperature dominated at 75 MHz. We find no visible correlation over different k-modes in Fourier space in the presence of noise for realistic thermal noise scenarios. We conclude that the sky-based transient RFI from aeroplanes, satellites and meteorites at present does not pose a significant concern for the ACE analyses at the current level of sensitivity and after integrating over the available 500 hours of observed data. However, it is crucial to mitigate or filter such transient RFI for more sensitive experiments aiming for significantly deeper integration.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a model that modifies general relativity on cosmological scales, specifically by having a 'glitch' in the gravitational constant between the cosmological (super-horizon) and Newtonian (sub-horizon) regimes. This gives a single-parameter extension to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, which is equivalent to adding a dark energy component, but where the energy density of this component can have either sign. Fitting to data from the Planck satellite, we find that negative contributions are, in fact, preferred. Additionally, we find that roughly one percent weaker superhorizon gravity can significantly ease the Hubble and clustering tensions in a range of cosmological observations, although at the expense of spoiling fits to the baryonic acoustic oscillation scale in galaxy surveys. Therefore, the extra parametric freedom offered by our model deserves further exploration, and we discuss how future observations may elucidate this potential cosmic glitch in gravity, through a four-fold reduction in statistical uncertainties.
#### Inefficient acceleration of electrons in the shocked wind of the massive  star $Θ^1$ Ori C within the Trapezium cluster

 - **Abstract**
 Shocked winds of massive stars in young stellar clusters have been proposed as possible sites in which relativistic particles are accelerated. Electrons, accelerated in such an environment, are expected to efficiently comptonize optical radiation (from massive stars) and the infra-red radiation (re-scattered by the dust within the cluster) producing GeV-TeV gamma-rays. We investigate the time dependent process of acceleration, propagation and radiation of electrons in the stellar wind of the massive star $\Theta^1$ Ori C within the Trapezium cluster. This cluster is located within the nearby Orion Nebula (M 42). We show that the gamma-ray emission expected from the Trapezium cluster is consistent with the present observations of the Orion Molecular Cloud by the Fermi-LAT telescope provided that the efficiency of energy conversion from the stellar wind to relativistic electrons is very low, i.e. $\chi < 10^{-4}$. For such low efficiencies, the gamma-ray emission from electrons accelerated in the stellar wind of $\Theta^1$ Ori C can be only barely observed by the future Cherenkov telescopes, e.g. the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).

 - **Abstract**
 Solar prominences contain a significant amount of neutral species. The dynamics of the ionised and neutral fluids composing the prominence plasma can be slightly different if the collisional coupling is not strong enough. Large-scale velocities can be quantified by Doppler effect. Small-scale velocities leave their imprint on the width of spectral lines. Here we use one spectral line of ionised and two spectral lines of neutral elements to measure the resolved and unresolved velocities in a prominence with the aim to investigate the possible decoupling of the observed charged and neutral species. A prominence was observed with the German Vacuum Tower Telescope on June 17, 2017. Time series consisting of repeated 10-position scans were performed while recording simultaneously the intensity spectra of the Ca II 854.2 nm, H{\alpha} 656.28 nm, and HeD3 587.56 nm lines. The line-of-sight velocities and the Doppler width of the three spectral lines were determined at every spatial position and temporal moment. To make sure all spectral lines were sampling the same plasma volume, we applied selection criteria to identify locations with optically thin plasma. The velocities of the three spectral lines turned out to be very similar over this region, with the ionised Ca II showing velocity excursions systematically larger compared to those of the neutral lines of H{\alpha} and He I at some moments. The latter were found to be much closer to each other. The analysis of the Doppler widths indicated that the C aII line shows an excess of unresolved motions. The dynamics of the ionised and neutral plasma components in the observed prominence was very close one to the other. The differences found may indicate that a localised decoupling between ions and neutrals may appear at particular spatial locations or instants of time.

 - **Abstract**
 Parker Solar Probe (PSP) conducted several flybys of Venus while using Venus' gravity for orbital adjustments to enable its daring passes of the Sun. During these flybys, PSP turned to image the nightside of Venus using the Wide-field Imager for Solar PRobe (WISPR) optical telescopes, which unexpectedly observed Venus' surface through its thick and cloudy atmosphere in a theorized, but until-then unobserved near-visible spectral window below 0.8 $\mu$m. We use observations taken during PSP's fourth Venus gravity assist flyby to examine the origin of the Venus nightside flux and confirm the presence of this new atmospheric window through which to observe the surface geology of Venus. The WISPR images are well explained by emission from the hot Venus surface escaping through a new atmospheric window in the optical with an overlying emission component from the atmosphere at the limb that is consistent with O$_2$ nightglow. The surface thermal emission correlates strongly with surface elevation (via temperature) and emission angle. Tessera and plains units have distinct WISPR brightness values. Controlling for elevation, Ovda Regio tessera is brighter than Thetis Regio; likewise, the volcanic plains of Sogolon Planitia are brighter than the surrounding regional plains units. WISPR brightness at 0.8 $\mu$m is predicted to be positively correlated to FeO content in minerals; thus, the brighter units may have a different starting composition, be less weathered, or have larger particle sizes.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate knowledge of the interstellar medium (ISM) at high-Galactic latitudes is crucial for future cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization experiments due to extinction, albeit being low, being a foreground larger than the anticipated signal in these regions. We develop a Bayesian model to identify a region of the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram and an associated dataset suited to constrain the single-star extinction accurately at high-Galactic latitudes. Using photometry from Gaia, 2MASS and ALLWISE, parallax from Gaia and stellar parameters derived from the Gaia low-resolution BP/RP (XP) spectra as input data, we employ nested sampling to fit the model to the data and analyse samples from the extinction posterior. Charting low variations in extinction is complex due to both systematic errors and degeneracies between extinction and other stellar parameters. The systematics can be minimised by restricting our data to a region of the HR diagram where the stellar models are most accurate. Moreover, the degeneracies can be significantly reduced by including spectroscopic estimates of the effective temperature as data. We show that underestimating the measurement error on the data is detrimental to recovering an accurate extinction distribution. We demonstrate that a full posterior solution is necessary to understand the extinction parameter and find fine variation in the ISM. However, by only using the mean extinction and a prior assumption of spatial correlation, we can produce a dust map similar to other benchmark maps.

 ESA's mission Euclid, while undertaking its final integration stage, is fully qualified. Euclid will perform an extragalactic survey ($0<z<2$) by observing in the visible and near-infrared wavelength range. To detect infrared radiation, it is equipped with the Near Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) instrument, operating in the 0.9--2 $\mu$m range. In this paper, after introducing the survey strategy, we focus our attention on the NISP Data Processing Unit's Application Software, highlighting the experimental process to obtain the final parametrization of the on-board processing of data produced by the array of 16 Teledyne HAWAII-2RG (HgCdTe) detectors. We report results from the latest ground test campaigns with the flight configuration hardware - complete optical system (Korsh anastigmat telescope), detectors array (0.56 deg$^2$ field of view), and readout systems (16 Digital Control Units and Sidecar ASICs). The performance of the on-board processing is then presented. We also describe a major issue found during the final test phase. We show how the problem was identified and solved thanks to an intensive coordinated effort of an independent review `Tiger' team, lead by ESA, and a team of NISP experts from the Euclid Consortium. An extended PLM level campaign at ambient temperature in Li\`ege and a dedicated test campaign conducted in Marseille on the NISP EQM model eventually confirmed the resolution of the problem. Finally, we report examples of the outstanding spectrometric (using a Blue and two Red Grisms) and photometric performance of the NISP instrument, as derived from the end-to-end payload module test campaign at FOCAL 5 -- CSL; these results include the photometric Point Spread Function (PSF) determination and the spectroscopic dispersion verification.

 - **Abstract**
 The universality or non-universality of the initial mass function (IMF) has significant implications for determining star formation rates and star formation histories from photometric properties of stellar populations. We reexamine whether the IMF is deficient in high-mass stars (top-light) in the low-density environment of the outer disk of M83 and constrain the shape of the IMF therein. Using archival Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) far ultraviolet (FUV) and near ultraviolet (NUV) data and new deep OmegaCAM narrowband H$\alpha$ imaging, we constructed a catalog of FUV-selected objects in the outer disk of M83. We counted H$\alpha$-bright clusters and clusters that are blue in FUV$-$NUV in the catalog, measured the maximum flux ratio $F_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}/f_{\lambda \mathrm{FUV}}$ among the clusters, and measured the total flux ratio $\Sigma F_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}/\Sigma f_{\lambda \mathrm{FUV}}$ over the catalog. We then compared these measurements to predictions from stellar population synthesis models made with a standard Salpeter IMF, truncated IMFs, and steep IMFs. We also investigated the effect of varying the assumed internal extinction on our results. We are not able to reproduce our observations with models using the standard Salpeter IMF or the truncated IMFs. It is only when assuming an average internal extinction of $0.10 < A_{\mathrm{V}} < 0.15$ in the outer disk stellar clusters that models with steep IMFs ($\alpha > 3.1$) simultaneously reproduce the observed cluster counts, the maximum observed $F_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}/f_{\lambda \mathrm{FUV}}$, and the observed $\Sigma F_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}/\Sigma f_{\lambda \mathrm{FUV}}$. Our results support a non-universal IMF that is deficient in high-mass stars in low-density environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of primordial black holes in the early universe may happen through the collapse of large curvature perturbations generated during a non-attractor phase of inflation or through a curvaton-like dynamics after inflation. The fact that such small-scale curvature perturbation is typically non-Gaussian leads to the renormalization of composite operators built up from the smoothed density contrast and entering in the calculation of the primordial black abundance. Such renormalization causes the phenomenon of operator mixing and the appearance of an infinite tower of local, non-local and higher-derivative operators as well as to a sizable shift in the threshold for primordial black hole formation. This hints that the calculation of the primordial black hole abundance is more involved than what generally assumed.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations suggest the presence of clouds in exoplanet atmospheres but have also shown that certain chemical species in the upper atmosphere might not be in chemical equilibrium. The goal of this work is to calculate the two main cloud formation processes, nucleation and bulk growth, consistently from a non-equilibrium gas-phase. The aim is further to explore the interaction between a kinetic gas-phase and cloud micro-physics. The cloud formation is modeled using the moment method and kinetic nucleation which are coupled to a gas-phase kinetic rate network. Specifically, the formation of cloud condensation nuclei is derived from cluster rates that include the thermochemical data of (TiO$_2$)$_N$ from N = 1 to 15. The surface growth of 9 bulk Al/Fe/Mg/O/Si/S/Ti binding materials considers the respective gas-phase species through condensation and surface reactions as derived from kinetic disequilibrium. The effect of completeness of rate networks and the time evolution of the cloud particle formation is studied for an example exoplanet HD 209458 b. A consistent, fully time-dependent cloud formation model in chemical disequilibrium with respect to nucleation, bulk growth and the gas-phase is presented and first test cases are studied. This model shows that cloud formation in exoplanet atmospheres is a fast process. This confirms previous findings that the formation of cloud particles is a local process. Tests on selected locations within the atmosphere of the gas-giant HD 209458 b show that the cloud particle number density and volume reach constant values within 1s. The complex kinetic polymer nucleation of TiO$_2$ confirms results from classical nucleation models. The surface reactions of SiO[s] and SiO$_2$[s] can create a catalytic cycle that dissociates H$_2$ to 2 H, resulting in a reduction of the CH$_4$ number densities.

 - **Abstract**
 Occultations are windows of opportunity to indirectly peek into the dayside atmosphere of exoplanets. High-precision transit events provide information on the spin-orbit alignment of exoplanets around fast-rotating hosts. We aim to precisely measure the planetary radius and geometric albedo of the ultra-hot Jupiter (UHJ) KELT-20 b as well as the system's spin-orbit alignment. We obtained optical high-precision transits and occultations of KELT-20 b using CHEOPS observations in conjunction with the simultaneous TESS observations. We interpret the occultation measurements together with archival infrared observations to measure the planetary geometric albedo and dayside temperatures. We further use the host star's gravity-darkened nature to measure the system's obliquity. We present time-averaged precise occultation depth of 82(6) ppm measured with seven CHEOPS visits and 131(+8/-7) ppm from the analysis of all available TESS photometry. Using these measurements, we precisely constrain the geometric albedo of KELT-20 b to 0.26(0.04) and the brightness temperature of the dayside hemisphere to 2566(+77/-80) K. Assuming Lambertian scattering law, we constrain the Bond albedo to 0.36(+0.04/-0.05) along with a minimal heat transfer to the nightside. Furthermore, using five transit observations we provide stricter constraints of 3.9(1.1) degrees on the sky-projected obliquity of the system. The aligned orbit of KELT-20 b is in contrast to previous CHEOPS studies that have found strongly inclined orbits for planets orbiting other A-type stars. KELT-20 b's comparably high planetary geometric albedo corroborates a known trend of strongly irradiated planets being more reflective. Finally, we tentatively detect signs of temporal variability in the occultation depths, which might indicate variable cloud cover advecting onto the planetary dayside.

 - **Abstract**
 We show the first SPHERE/IRDIS and IFS data of the CO-rich debris disc around HD 131488. We use N-body simulations to model both the scattered light images and the SED of the disc in a self-consistent way. We apply the Henyey-Greenstein approximation, Mie theory, and the Discrete Dipole Approximation to model the emission of individual dust grains. Our study shows that only when gas drag is taken into account can we find a model that is consistent with scattered light as well as thermal emission data of the disc. The models suggest a gas surface density of $2\times10^{-5}\,M_\oplus/$au$^2$ which is in agreement with estimates from ALMA observations. Thus, our modelling procedure allows us to roughly constrain the expected amount of gas in a debris disc without actual gas measurements. We also show that the shallow size distribution of the dust leads to a significant contribution of large particles to the overall amount of scattered light. The scattering phase function indicates a dust porosity of $\sim0.2\ldots 0.6$ which is in agreement with a pebble pile scenario for planetesimal growth.

 - **Abstract**
 The separate-universe approach gives an intuitive way to understand the evolution of cosmological perturbations in the long-wavelength limit. It uses solutions of the spatially-homogeneous equations of motion to model the evolution of the inhomogeneous universe on large scales. We show that the separate-universe approach fails on a finite range of super-Hubble scales at a sudden transition from slow roll to ultra-slow roll during inflation in the very early universe. Such transitions are a feature of inflation models giving a large enhancement in the primordial power spectrum on small scales, necessary to produce primordial black holes after inflation. We show that the separate-universe approach still works in a piece-wise fashion, before and after the transition, but spatial gradients on finite scales require a discontinuity in the homogeneous solution at the transition. We discuss the implications for the $\delta N$ formalism and stochastic inflation, which employ the separate-universe approximation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Einstein-Boltzmann module of the DISCO-DJ (DIfferentiable Simulations for COsmology - Done with JAX) software package. This module implements a fully differentiable solver for the linearised cosmological Einstein-Boltzmann equations in the JAX framework, and allows computing Jacobian matrices of all solver output with respect to all input parameters using automatic differentiation. This implies that along with the solution for a given set of parameters, the tangent hyperplane in parameter space is known as well, which is a key ingredient for cosmological inference and forecasting problems as well as for many other applications. We discuss our implementation and demonstrate that our solver agrees at the per-mille level with the existing non-differentiable solvers CAMB and CLASS, including massive neutrinos and a dark energy fluid with parameterised equation of state. We illustrate the dependence of various summary statistics in large-scale structure cosmology on model parameters using the differentiable solver, and finally demonstrate how it can be easily used for Fisher forecasting. Since the implementation is significantly shorter and more modular than existing solvers, it is easy to extend our solver to include additional physics, such as additional dark energy models, modified gravity, or other non-standard physics.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel approach to parameterize the equation of state for Scalar Field Dark Energy (SFDE) and use it to derive analytical solutions for various cosmological parameters. Using statistical MCMC with Bayesian techniques, we obtain constraint values for the model parameters and analyze three observational datasets. We find a quintessence-like behavior for Dark Energy (DE) with positive values for both model parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Our analysis of the $CC$+$BAO$+$SNe$ datasets reveals that the transition redshift and the current value of the deceleration parameter are $z_{tr}=0.73_{-0.01}^{+0.03}$ and $q_{0}=-0.44_{-0.02}^{+0.03}$, respectively. We also investigate the fluid flow of accretion SFDE around a Black Hole (BH) and analyze the nature of the BH's dynamical mass during accretion, taking into account Hawking radiation and BH evaporation. Our proposed model offers insight into the nature of DE in the Universe and the behavior of BHs during accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 We present CO(2-1) and $^{13}$CO(2-1) maps of the Cygnus-X molecular cloud complex using the 10m Heinrich Hertz Submillimeter Telescope (SMT). The maps cover the southern portion of the complex which is strongly impacted by the feedback from the Cygnus OB2 association. Combining CO(1-0) and $^{13}$CO(1-0) maps from the Nobeyama 45m Cygnus-X CO Survey, we carry out a multi-transition molecular line analysis with RADEX and derive the volume density of velocity-coherent gas components. We select those components with a column density in the power-law tail part of the column density probability distribution function (N-PDF) and assemble their volume density into a volume density PDF ($\rho$-PDF). The $\rho$-PDF exhibits a power-law shape in the range of 10$^{4.5}$ cm$^{-3}$ $\lesssim n_{\rm H_2} \lesssim$ 10$^{5.5}$ cm$^{-3}$ with a fitted slope of $\alpha = -1.12 \pm 0.05$. The slope is shallower than what is predicted by simulations of rotationally supported structures or those undergoing gravitational collapse. Applying the same analysis to synthetic observations with feedback may help identify the cause of the shallow slope. The $\rho$-PDF provides another useful benchmark for testing models of molecular cloud formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The vastness of a clear night sky evokes curiosity about the distance to the stars. There are two primary methods for estimating stellar distances, parallax and luminosity. In this study, we present a new analysis revealing a noteworthy discrepancy between these two methods. Due to the accuracy of GAIA, parallaxes can directly be converted into distances. In contrast, luminosity distances require, apart from the determination of the apparent and absolute brightness of a star, the reddening value that allows a correction for interstellar extinction. Using 47 stars with non-peculiar reddening curves from the high-quality sample we find here that the luminosity distance overestimates the parallactic distance for most (80 %) of these stars. This puzzling discrepancy can only be removed when incorporating a new population of large dust grains, so-called dark dust, with our model that respects contemporary constraints of the inter-stellar dust and is updated to scope for the first time with absolute reddening. The model provides a visual extinction which unifies the conflicting distances. Another far-reaching consequence of the flat absorption and scattering properties of dark dust is that it broadens the light curves of SN Ia, which serves as a measure of the quantity of dark energy.
