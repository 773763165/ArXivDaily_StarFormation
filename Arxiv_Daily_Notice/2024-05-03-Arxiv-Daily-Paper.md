 - **Abstract**
 We present ionization structures of IC 2003, a planetary nebula with [WR] central star, using a 1-D dusty photo-ionization code: \textit{"CLOUDY 17.03"}. The photo-ionization model is constrained by archival UV emission line fluxes, medium-resolution optical spectroscopy, $IRAS$ $25 \mu m$ flux, absolute $H\beta$ flux, and the mean angular size of the nearly spherical optical nebula. To constrain the carbon abundance and the effect of photo-electric heating in the ionized gas, we used UV emission lines. We considered an amorphous carbon dust grain with MRN and KMH size distributions to address the importance of photo-electric heating in the ionized nebula. We show that KMH grain size distribution with quantum dust heating reproduces the observations quite well. We construct the ionization structures of different elements at their different ionization stages in the nebula. We derive the physical properties of the planetary nebula and its chemical composition, as well as the parameters of its central star. The estimated nebular dust-to-gas mass ratio is $2.37\times 10^{-3}$, and the enhanced photo-electric heating yielded by small dust grains is $9.4\%$ of the total heating. We considered the H-poor model atmosphere for the central star; the effective temperature of the central star is 177kK, the specific gravity log(g) is 6, and its luminosity ($L_*$) is 6425 $L_\odot$. The derived central star parameters plotted on stellar evolutionary tracks correspond to a central star mass of 0.636$M_\odot $ and to a progenitor mass of 3.26$M_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a simple fit function, $L_{\nu_i}(t) = C\, t^{-\alpha}\, e^{-(t/\tau)^{n}}$, to parametrize the luminosities of neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors during the protoneutron star (PNS) cooling phase at post-bounce times $t \gtrsim 1$ s. This fit is based on results from a set of neutrino-hydrodynamics simulations of core-collapse supernovae in spherical symmetry. The simulations were performed with an energy-dependent transport for six neutrino species and took into account the effects of convection and muons in the dense and hot PNS interior. We provide values of the fit parameters $C$, $\alpha$, $\tau$, and $n$ for different neutron star masses and equations of state as well as correlations between these fit parameters. Our functional description is useful for analytic supernova modeling, for characterizing the neutrino light curves in large underground neutrino detectors, and as a tool to extract information from measured signals on the mass and equation of state of the PNS and on secondary signal components on top of the PNS's neutrino emission.
#### Mass segregation and velocity dispersion as evidence for a dark star  cluster

 - **Abstract**
 A dark star cluster (DSC) is a system in which the cluster potential is dominated by stellar remnants, such as black holes and neutron stars having larger masses than the long-lived low-mass stars. Due to mass segregation, these remnants are located in the central region of the cluster and form a dark core. We expect that at a few kpc from the Galactic centre, the efficient evaporation of the lower-mass stars caused by the strong tidal force exposes the dark core, because the dynamical properties of the DSC are dominated by the remnants. Due to the invisibility of the remnants, finding a DSC by observation is challenging. In this project, we use $N$-body simulations to obtain models of DSCs and try to discern observables that signify a DSC. We consider four observables: the mass spectrum, the observational mass density profile, the observational velocity dispersion profile and the mass segregation. The models show that a DSC typically exhibits two distinct characteristics: for a given mass in stars and a given half-light radius the expected velocity dispersion is underestimated when only visible stars are considered, and there is a lack of measurable mass segregation among the stars. These properties can be helpful for finding DSCs in observational data, such as the Gaia catalogue.
#### No longer impossible: the self-lensing binary KIC 8145411 is a triple

 - **Abstract**
 Five self-lensing binaries (SLBs) have been discovered with data from the \textit{Kepler} mission. One of these systems is KIC 8145411, which was reported to host an extremely low mass (ELM; $0.2\,M_{\odot}$) white dwarf (WD) in a 456-day orbit with a solar-type companion. The system has been dubbed ``impossible'', because evolutionary models predict that $\sim 0.2\,M_{\odot}$ WDs should only be found in tight orbits ($P_{\rm orb} \lesssim$ days). In this work, we show that KIC 8145411 is in fact a hierarchical triple system: it contains a WD orbiting a solar-type star, with another solar-type star $\sim 700\,$AU away. The wide companion was unresolved in the Kepler light curves, was just barely resolved in Gaia DR3, and is resolved beyond any doubt by high-resolution imaging. We show that the presence of this tertiary confounded previous mass measurements of the WD for two reason: it dilutes the amplitude of the self-lensing pulses, and it reduces the apparent radial velocity (RV) variability amplitude of the WD's companion due to line blending. By jointly fitting the system's light curves, RVs, and multi-band photometry using a model with two luminous stars, we obtain a revised WD mass of $(0.53 \pm 0.01)\,M_{\odot}$. Both luminous stars are near the end of their main-sequence evolution. The WD is thus not an ELM WD, and the system does not suffer the previously proposed challenges to its formation history. Similar to the other SLBs and the population of astrometric WD binaries recently identified from Gaia data, KIC 8145411 has parameters in tension with standard expectations for formation through both stable and unstable mass transfer. The system's properties are likely best understood as a result of unstable mass transfer from an AGB star donor.
#### H1 Ly$α$ Emission from a Metal-Poor Cool Stream Fueling an Early  Dusty Starburst

 - **Abstract**
 The GAMA J0913$-$0107 system is a rare conjunction of a submillimeter galaxy (SMG) at $z \approx 2.7$ and two background QSOs with projected separations $<$200 kpc. Previous high-resolution QSO absorption-line spectroscopy has revealed high H $\tiny{\rm I}$ column density, extremely metal-poor ($\sim 1\%$ solar) gas streams in the circumgalactic medium of the SMG. Here we present deep optical integral-field spectroscopy of the system with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). Reaching a $2\sigma$ surface brightness (SB) limit $\approx 10^{-19}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ with $\sim$2 hours of integration time, we detect a filamentary Ly$\alpha$ nebula stretching $\sim$180 kpc from the SMG intercepting both QSO sightlines. This Ly$\alpha$ filament may correspond to the same cool gas stream penetrating through the hot halo seen in the absorption. In contrast to Ly$\alpha$ nebulae around QSOs, there is no obvious local source for photoionization due to the massive dust content. While uncertain, we consider the possibility that the nebula is ionized by shocks induced by the infall, obscured star formation, and/or a boosted UV background. The SMG-QSOs conjunction multiplied the efficiency of the KCWI observations, allowing a direct comparison of Ly$\alpha$ nebulae in two distinct environments. We find that the nebula around the QSOs are much brighter and show steeper surface brightness profiles than the SMG nebula. This is consistent with the additional photoionization and Ly$\alpha$ scattering provided by the QSOs. While illustrating the challenges of detecting Ly$\alpha$ nebulae around SMGs, our work also demonstrates that important insights can be gained from comparative studies of high-$z$ Ly$\alpha$ nebulae.

 - **Abstract**
 The kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect is a blackbody cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropy induced by Thomson scattering off free electrons in bulk motion with respect to the CMB rest frame. The statistically anisotropic cross-correlation between the CMB and galaxy surveys encodes the radial bulk velocity (more generally, the remote dipole field), which can be efficiently reconstructed using a quadratic estimator. Here, we develop and implement a quadratic estimator for the remote dipole field to data from the Planck satellite and the unWISE galaxy redshift catalog. With this data combination, we forecast a $\sim 1$-$\sigma$ detection within $\Lambda$CDM assuming a simple model for the distribution of free electrons. Using reconstructions based on individual frequency temperature maps, we characterize the impact of foregrounds, concluding that they can be effectively mitigated by masking and removing the estimator monopole. We demonstrate that reconstructions based on component-separated CMB maps have no detectable biases from foregrounds or systematics at the level of the expected statistical error. We use these reconstructions to constrain the multiplicative optical depth bias to $b_v < 1.40$ at $68 \%$ confidence. Our fiducial signal model with $b_v =1$ is consistent with this measurement. Our results support an optimistic future for kSZ velocity reconstruction with near-term datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) analysis from the first year of data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), when combined with data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), has placed an upper-limit on the sum of neutrino masses, $\sum m_\nu < 70$ meV (95%). In addition to excluding the minimum sum associated with the inverted hierarchy, the posterior is peaked at $\sum m_\nu = 0$ and is close to excluding even the minumum sum, 58 meV at 2$\sigma$. In this paper, we explore the implications of this data for cosmology and particle physics. The sum of neutrino mass is determined in cosmology from the suppression of clustering in the late universe. Allowing the clustering to be enhanced, we extended the DESI analysis to $\sum m_\nu < 0$ and find $\sum m_\nu = - 160 \pm 90$ meV (68%), and that the suppression of power from the minimum sum of neutrino masses is excluded at 99% confidence. We show this preference for negative masses makes it challenging to explain the result by a shift of cosmic parameters, such as the optical depth or matter density. We then show how a result of $\sum m_\nu =0$ could arise from new physics in the neutrino sector, including decay, cooling, and/or time-dependent masses. These models are consistent with current observations but imply new physics that is accessible in a wide range of experiments. In addition, we discuss how an apparent signal with $\sum m_\nu < 0$ can arise from new long range forces in the dark sector or from a primordial trispectrum that resembles the signal of CMB lensing.

 - **Abstract**
 Continuous wavelet analysis is gaining popularity in science and engineering for its ability to analyze data across spatial and scale domain simultaneously. In this study, we introduce a wavelet-based method to identify halos and assess its feasibility in two-dimensional (2D) scenarios. We begin with the generation of four pseudo-2D datasets from the SIMBA dark matter simulation by compressing thin slices of three-dimensional (3D) data into 2D. We then calculate the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) directly from the particle distributions, identify local maxima that represent actual halos, and segment the CWT to delineate halo boundaries. A comparison with the traditional Friends-of-Friends (FOF) method shows that our CWT-identified halos, while containing slightly fewer particles, have smoother boundaries and are more compact in dense regions. In contrast, the CWT method can link particles over greater distances to form halos in sparse regions due to its spatial segmentation scheme. The spatial distribution and halo power spectrum of both CWT and FOF halos demonstrate substantial consistency, validating the 2D applicability of CWT for halo detection. Our identification scheme operates with a linear time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, suggesting its suitability for analyzing significantly larger datasets in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomical (or Milankovi\'c) forcing of the Earth system is key to understanding rhythmic climate change on time scales >~ 10 kyr. Paleoceanographic and paleoclimatological applications concerned with past astronomical forcing rely on astronomical calculations (solutions), which represent the backbone of cyclostratigraphy and astrochronology. Here we present state-of-the-art astronomical solutions over the past 3.5 Gyr. Our goal is to provide tuning targets and templates for interpreting deep-time cyclostratigraphic records and designing external forcing functions in climate models. Our approach yields internally consistent orbital and precession-tilt solutions, including fundamental solar system frequencies, orbital eccentricity and inclination, lunar distance, luni-solar precession rate, Earth's obliquity, and climatic precession. Contrary to expectations, we find that the long eccentricity cycle (previously assumed stable and labeled ''metronome'', recent period ~405 kyr), can become unstable on long time scales. Our results reveal episodes during which the long eccentricity cycle is very weak or absent and Earth's orbital eccentricity and climate-forcing spectrum are unrecognizable compared to the recent past. For the ratio of eccentricity-to-inclination amplitude modulation (frequently observable in paleorecords) we find a wide distribution around the recent 2:1 ratio, i.e., the system is not restricted to a 2:1 or 1:1 resonance state. Our computations show that Earth's obliquity was lower and its amplitude (variation around the mean) significantly reduced in the past. We therefore predict weaker climate forcing at obliquity frequencies in deep time and a trend toward reduced obliquity power with age in stratigraphic records. For deep-time stratigraphic and modeling applications, the orbital parameters of our 3.5-Gyr integrations are made available at 400-year resolution.

 - **Abstract**
 In this contribution, we present a short account of gravitational lenses and how to calculate different properties of its images in the case of having a transparent distribution of matter such as the uniform transparent sphere, isothermal gas sphere, non-singular isothermal gas sphere and a transparent King profile. With the help of XFGLenses software, and numerical methods, different images arising from all of these profiles, and the different caustics and critical curves are shown. The images were consistent with several previous results that are expected for transparent profiles, like having an odd number of images, and reducing the number of images by two when the source passes through the caustic. The curves shown in the caustics where the diamond, the ellipse and the lemniscate-like. For the critical curves, the most common curve was the ellipse, and the lemniscate appeared in the transparent NSIS case, which is consistent with the fact that these curves are common in gravitational lenses.

 - **Abstract**
 Patchy reionization generates kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Large-scale velocity perturbations along the line of sight modulate the small-scale kSZ power spectrum, leading to a trispectrum (or four-point function) in the CMB that depends on the physics of reionization. We investigate the challenges in detecting this trispectrum and use tools developed for CMB lensing, such as realization-dependent bias subtraction and cross-correlation based estimators, to counter uncertainties in the instrumental noise and assumed CMB power spectrum. We also find that both lensing and extragalactic foregrounds can impart larger trispectrum contributions than the reionization kSZ signal. We present a range of mitigation methods for both of these sources of contamination, validated on microwave-sky simulations. We use ACT DR6 and Planck data to calculate an upper limit on the reionization kSZ trispectrum from a measurement dominated by foregrounds. The upper limit is about 50 times the signal predicted from recent simulations.
#### Probing the dynamical and kinematical structures of detached shells  around AGB stars

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We aim to resolve the spatial and kinematic sub-structures in five detached-shell sources to provide detailed constraints for hydrodynamic models that describe the formation and evolution of the shells. Methods. We use observations of the 12 CO (1-0) emission towards five carbon-AGB stars with ALMA. The data have angular resolutions of 0.3 arcsec to 1arcsec and a velocity resolution of 0.3 km/s . This enables us to quantify spatial and kinematic structures in the shells. Results. The observed emission is separated into two distinct components: a more coherent, bright outer shell and a more filamentary, fainter inner shell. The kinematic information shows that the inner sub-shells move at a higher velocity relative to the outer sub-shells. The observed sub-structures confirm the predictions from hydrodynamical models. However, the models do not predict a double-shell structure, and the CO emission likely only traces the inner and outer edges of the shell, implying a lack of CO in the middle layers of the detached shell. Previous estimates of the masses and temperatures are consistent with originating mainly from the brighter subshell, but the total shell masses are likely lower limits. Conclusions. The observed spatial and kinematical splittings of the shells appear consistent with results from hydrodynamical models, provided the CO emission does not trace the H2 density distribution in the shell but rather traces the edges of the shells. It is therefore not possible to constrain the total shell mass based on the CO observations alone. Complementary observations of, e.g., CI as a dissociation product of CO would be necessary to understand the distribution of CO compared to H2.
#### Probing the nova shock physics with future gamma-ray observations of the  upcoming outburst from T Coronae Borealis

 - **Abstract**
 Nova shocks behave like scaled-down supernova remnant shocks with a lifetime of only a few weeks or months, thereby providing a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of non-relativistic shocks as well as the shock acceleration physics.Recently, GeV and TeV gamma-ray emissions from an outburst of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi have been observed. The light curves of the gamma-ray emissions suggest that they arise from an external shock, which is formed as the nova ejecta interacts with the ambient medium. The shock is thought to transit from an adiabatic shock to a radiative one at later times, but no such later observations are available for RS Ophiuchi. In addition, the spectral evolution of the gamma-ray outburst of RS Ophiuchi was not well measured, and hence the related particle acceleration mechanisms are not well understood. T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is another recurrent nova in Milky Way and its last outburst was nearly ten times brighter than RS Ophiuichi. Recently the optical light curve of T CrB displayed a state transition behavior before the eruption, and it was predicted that T CrB will undergo an outburst in the near future. By performing a theoretical investigation, we find that Fermi-LAT could capture the transition of the shock from the adiabatic phase to the radiative phase at the GeV band, thanks to a longer detectable time than that of RS Ophiuchi.Due to its higher brightness, we also find that imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) such as MAGIC and VERITAS, and extensive air shower experiments such as LHAASO could detect the nova outburst and measure the gamma-ray spectrum in the very-high-energy (VHE, energy above 0.1 TeV) band more precisely. This can be used to constrain the high-energy cutoff index in the accelerated proton spectrum and the acceleration efficiency, which will shed light on the particle acceleration physics in nova shocks.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars rotate faster, on average, than lower mass stars. Stellar rotation triggers hydrodynamical instabilities which transport angular momentum and chemical species from the core to the surface. Models of high-mass stars that include these processes predict that chemical mixing is stronger at lower metallicity. We aim to test this prediction by comparing the surface abundances of massive stars at different metallicities. We performed a spectroscopic analysis of single O stars in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) based on the ULLYSES and XshootU surveys. We determined the fundamental parameters and helium, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen surface abundances of 17 LMC and 17 SMC non-supergiant O6-9.5 stars. We complemented these determinations by literature results for additional MCs and also Galactic stars to increase the sample size and metallicity coverage. We investigated the differences in the surface chemical enrichment at different metallicities and compared them with predictions of three sets of evolutionary models. Surface abundances are consistent with CNO-cycle nucleosynthesis. The maximum surface nitrogen enrichment is stronger in MC stars than in Galactic stars. Nitrogen enrichment is also observed in stars with higher surface gravities in the SMC than in the Galaxy. This trend is predicted by models that incorporate chemical transport caused by stellar rotation. The distributions of projected rotational velocities in our samples are likely biased towards slow rotators. A metallicity dependence of surface abundances is demonstrated. The analysis of larger samples with an unbiased distribution of projected rotational velocities is required to better constrain the treatment of chemical mixing and angular momentum transport in massive single and binary stars.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs are the dense, burnt-out remnants of the vast majority of stars, condemned to cool over billions of years as they steadily radiate away their residual thermal energy. To first order, their atmosphere is expected to be made purely of hydrogen due to the efficient gravitational settling of heavier elements. However, observations reveal a much more complex situation, as the surface of a white dwarf (1) can be dominated by helium rather than hydrogen, (2) can be polluted by trace chemical species, and (3) can undergo significant composition changes with time. This indicates that various mechanisms of element transport effectively compete against gravitational settling in the stellar envelope. This phenomenon is known as the spectral evolution of white dwarfs and has important implications for Galactic, stellar, and planetary astrophysics. This invited review provides a comprehensive picture of our current understanding of white dwarf spectral evolution. We first describe the latest observational constraints on the variations in atmospheric composition along the cooling sequence, covering both the dominant and trace constituents. We then summarise the predictions of state-of-the-art models of element transport in white dwarfs and assess their ability to explain the observed spectral evolution. Finally, we highlight remaining open questions and suggest avenues for future work.
#### Satellite lines from autoionizing states of Fe XVI and the problems with  the X-ray Fe XVII lines

 - **Abstract**
 We present new calculations of atomic data needed to model autoionizing states of Fe XVI. We compare the state energies, radiative and excitation data with a sample of results from previous literature. We find a large scatter of results, the most significant ones in the autoionization rates, which are very sensitive to the configuration interaction and state mixing. We find relatively good agreement between the autoionization rates and the collisional excitation rates calculated with the R-matrix suite of programs and autostructure. The largest model, which includes J-resolved states up to n=10, produces ab-initio wavelengths and intensities of the satellite lines which agree well with solar high-resolution spectra of active regions, with few minor wavelength adjustements. We review previous literature, finding many incorrect identifications, most notably those in the NIST database. We provide several new tentative identifications in the 15-15.7 A range, and several new ones at shorter wavelengths, where previous lines were unidentified. Compared to the previous CHIANTI model, the present one has an increased flux in the 15--15.7 A range at 2 MK of a factor of 1.9, resolving the discrepancies found in the analysis of the Marshall Grazing Incidence X-Ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS) observation. It appears that the satellite lines also resolve the long-standing discrepancy in the intensity of the important Fe XVII 3D line at 15.26 A.

 - **Abstract**
 3-Hydroxypropenal (HOCHCHCHO) is the lower energy tautomer of malonaldehyde which displays a complex rotation-tunneling spectrum. It was detected tentatively toward the solar-type protostar IRAS 16293$-$2422 B with ALMA in the framework of the Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey (PILS). Several transitions, however, had large residuals, preventing not only their detection, but also the excitation temperature of the species from being determined unambiguously. We want to extend the existing rotational line list of 3-hydroxypropenal to shed more light on the recent observational results and to facilitate additional radio astronomical searches for this molecule. We analyzed the rotation-tunneling spectrum of 3-hydroxypropenal in the frequency regions between 150 and 330 GHz and between 400 and 660 GHz. Transitions were searched for in the PILS observations of IRAS 16293$-$2422. Local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) models were carried out and compared to the observations to constrain the excitation temperature. Additional transitions were searched for in other ALMA archival data of the same source to confirm the presence of 3-hydroxypropenal. More than 11500 transitions were assigned in the course of our investigation with quantum numbers $2 \le J \le 100$, $K_a \le 59$, and $K_c \le 97$, resulting in a greatly improved set of spectroscopic parameters. The comparison between the LTE models and the observations yields an excitation temperature of 125 K with a column density $N = 1.0 \times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ for this species. We identified seven additional lines of 3-hydroxypropenal that show a good agreement with the model in the ALMA archive data. The calculated rotation-tunneling spectrum of 3-hydroxypropenal has sufficient accuracy for radio astronomical searches. The detection of 3-hydroxypropenal toward IRAS 16293$-$2422 B is now secure.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of the dynamics of proto-compact star (PCS) convection and the core ${}^2\!g_1$-mode in core-collapse supernovae based on general relativistic 2D and 3D neutrino hydrodynamics simulations. Based on 2D simulations, we derive a mode relation for the core $g$-mode frequency in terms of PCS and equation of state parameters, and discuss its limits of accuracy. This relation may prove useful for parameter inference from future supernova gravitational wave (GW) signals if the core $g$-mode or an emission gap at the avoided crossing with the fundamental mode can be detected. The current 3D simulation does not show GW emission from the core $g$-mode due to less power in high-frequency convective motions to excite the mode, however. Analysing the dynamics of PCS convection in 3D, we find that simple scaling laws for convective velocity from mixing-length theory (MLT) do not apply. Energy and lepton number transport is instead governed by a more complex balance between neutrino fluxes and turbulent fluxes that results in roughly uniform rates of change of entropy and lepton number in the PCS convection zone. Electron fraction and enthalpy contrasts in PCS convection are not well captured by the MLT gradient approximation. We find distinctly different spectra for the turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent fluctuations in the electron fraction, which scale approximately as $l^{-1}$ without a downturn at low $l$. We suggest that the different turbulence spectrum of the electron fraction is naturally expected for a passive scalar quantity.

 - **Abstract**
 The Hubble constant, $H_0$, tension is the tension among the local probes, Supernovae Ia, and the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. It has been almost a decade, and this tension still puzzles the community. Here, we add intermediate redshift probes, such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) and Quasars (QS0s), to check if and to what extent these higher redshift probes can reduce this tension. We use the three-dimensional fundamental plane relation among the prompt peak luminosity, the luminosity at the end of the plateau emission, and its rest frame duration. We find similar trend in GRB intrinsic parameters as previously seen in Pantheon-Plus intrinsic parameters. We find an apparent $3.14\sigma$ tension for the GRB intrinsic parameter $b$. Indeed, this tension disappears and the parameters are actually compatible within $2.26\sigma$. Another interesting point is that the 3D relation plays an important role in conjunction with Supernovae data with Pantheon Plus and that this apparent discrepancy show how it is important the correction for selection biases and redshift evolution. The incorporation of redshift evolution correction results in a reduction of the GRB tension to $2.26\sigma$ when adjusting correction parameters. We envision that with more data this indication of tension will possibly disappear when the evolutionary parameters of GRBs are computed with increased precision.

 - **Abstract**
 Commercial flatbed scanners have the potential to deliver a quick and efficient means of capturing the scientific content of spectra recorded on photographic plates. We discuss the digitization of selected spectra in the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory (DAO) photographic plate collection with commercial scanners. In this pilot study, emphasis is placed on assessing if the information on the plates can be recovered using Epson V800 and 12000XL scanners; the more complicated issues associated with the shortcomings of photographic materials, such as correcting for nonlinearity, are deferred to a future study. Spectra of Vega that were recorded over ~4 decades with the DAO 1.8 meter telescope are examined. These spectra sample a range of photographic emulsions, plate preparation techniques, calibration information, observing techniques, and spectrograph configuration. A scanning density of 2400 elements per inch recovers information in the spectra. Differences in the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the two scanners are found, with the Epson 12000XL having a superior MTF. Comparisons with a CCD spectrum of Vega confirm that moderately weak features are faithfully recovered in photographic spectra that have been digitized with the 12000XL scanner. The importance of scanning the full plate to cover the light profile of the target and calibration information is emphasized. Lessons learned from these experiments are also presented.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars represent unique laboratories, offering insights into the physics of supranuclear-density matter and serving as potential hosts for dark matter. This study explores the impact of dark matter cores on rapidly rotating neutron stars through the two-fluid approximation, assuming minimal interaction between baryonic matter and dark matter. The investigation employs phenomenological models for fermionic and bosonic dark matter, revealing that universal relations governing mass and radius changes due to rotation remain largely unaffected in the presence of a dark matter core. Specifically, for a 5 % dark matter mass fraction, the percent deviations in total mass ($M_{tot}$), the baryonic equatorial radius ($R_{Be}$), and polar-to-equatorial baryonic radius ratio ($R_{ratioB}$) are within 3.9 %, 1.8 %, and 1.4 %, respectively. These findings suggest that the universal relations governing neutron star shape can be utilized to infer constraints on the properties of dark matter cores even in cases where the dark matter significantly softens the neutron star's equation of state.
#### Insight-HXMT View of the BHC Swift J1727.8-1613 during its outburst in  2023

 - **Abstract**
 The transient Galactic black hole candidate Swift J1727.8-1613 went through an outburst for the very first time that started in August 2023 and lasted for almost 6 months. We study the timing and spectral properties of this source using publicly available archival Insight-HXMT data for the first 10 observation IDs that last from MJD 60181 to 60198 with a total of 92 exposures for all three energy bands. We extracted the quasi-periodic oscillation properties by model fitting the power density spectrum and from those properties we designate that the QPOs are type-C in nature. We also conclude that the origin of the QPOs could be the shock instabilities, formed in the transonic accretion flow around black holes. The spectral analysis was performed using simultaneous data from the three on-board instruments LE, ME, and HE of HXMT in the broad energy band of $2-150 $ keV. To achieve the best fit, we needed a combination of interstellar absorption, power-law, multi-color disk-blackbody continuum, gaussian emission/absorption, and power-law reflection by neutral material. From the spectral properties, we found that the source was in an intermediate state at the start of the analysis period and was making a transition toward the softer states. The shock (the boundary layer of the corona) moved inward in progressive days in accordance with the spectral nature. We found that the source is present in a high-inclination binary system. The hydrogen column density was found with an average value of $0.27_{-0.17}^{+0.08}\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$.

 - **Abstract**
 With active time-domain surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility, the anticipated Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and multi-messenger experiments such as LIGO/VIRGO/KANGRA for gravitational wave detection and IceCube for high-energy neutrino events, there is a new era in both time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy. The Astro2020 decadal survey highlights effectively responding to these astronomical alerts in a timely manner as a priority, and thus, there is an urgent need for the development of a seamless follow-up infrastructure at existing facilities that are capable of following up on detections at the survey depths. At the W. M. Keck Observatory (WMKO), we are actively constructing critical infrastructure, aimed at facilitating the Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) trigger, optimizing observational planning, streamlining data acquisition, and enhancing data product accessibility. In this document, we provide an overview of these developing services and place them in context of existing observatory infrastructure like the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) and Data Services Initiative (DSI).

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarf symbiotic binaries are detected in X-rays with luminosities in the range of 10$^{30}$ to 10$^{34}$ lumcgs. Their X-ray emission arises either from the accretion disk boundary layer, from a region where the winds from both components collide or from nuclear burning on the white dwarf surface. In our continuous effort to identify X-ray emitting symbiotic stars, we studied four systems using observations from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and XMM-Newton satellites in X-rays and from TESS in the optical. The X-ray spectra were fit with absorbed optically thin thermal plasma models, either single- or multitemperature with kT $<$ 8 keV for all targets. Based on the characteristics of their X-ray spectra, we classified BD Cam as possible $\beta$-type, V1261 Ori and CD -27 8661 as $\delta$-type, and confirmed NQ Gem as $\beta$/$\delta$-type. The $\delta$-type X-ray emission most likely arise in the boundary layer of the accretion disk, while in the case of BD Cam, its mostly-soft emission originates from shocks, possibly between the red giant and WD/disk winds. In general, we have found that the observed X-ray emission is powered by accretion at a low accretion rate of about 10$^{-11}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The low ratio of X-ray to optical luminosities, however indicates that the accretion-disk boundary layer is mostly optically thick and tends to emit in the far or extreme UV. The detection of flickering in optical data provides evidence of the existence of an accretion disk.
#### Confronting sparse Gaia DR3 photometry with TESS for a sample of about  60,000 hot massive non-radial pulsators

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia mission has delivered hundreds of thousands of variable star light curves in multiple wavelengths. Recent work demonstrates that these light curves can be used to identify (non-)radial pulsations in the OBAF-type stars, despite the irregular cadence and low light curve precision of order a few mmag. With the considerably more precise TESS photometry, we revisit these candidate pulsators to conclusively ascertain the nature of their variability. We seek to re-classify the Gaia light curves with the first two years of TESS photometry for a sample of 58,970 p- and g- mode pulsators, encompassing gamma Dor, delta Scuti, SPB, and beta Cep variables. We also supply four new catalogues containing the confirmed pulsators, along with their dominant and secondary pulsation frequencies, the number of independent mode frequencies, and a ranking according to their usefulness for future asteroseismic ensemble analysis. We find that the Gaia photometry is exceptionally accurate for detecting the dominant and secondary frequencies, reaching approximately 80% accuracy in frequency for p- and g-mode pulsators. The majority of Gaia classifications are consistent with the classifications from the TESS data, illustrating the power of the low-cadence Gaia photometry for pulsation studies. We find that the sample of g-mode pulsators forms a continuous group of variable stars along the main sequence across B, A, and F spectral types, implying that the mode excitation mechanisms for all these pulsators need to be updated with improved physics. Finally, we provide a rank-ordered table of pulsators according to their asteroseismic potential for follow-up studies. Our catalogue offers a major increase in the number of confirmed gravity-mode pulsators with an identified dominant mode suitable for follow-up TESS ensemble asteroseismology of such stars.
