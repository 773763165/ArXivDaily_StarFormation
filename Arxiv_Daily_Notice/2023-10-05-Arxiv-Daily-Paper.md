 - **Abstract**
 Recent space-based missions have ushered in a new era of observational astronomy, where high-cadence photometric light curves for thousands to millions of stars in the solar neighborhood can be used to test and apply stellar age-dating methods, including gyrochronology. Combined with precise kinematics, these data allow for powerful new insights into our understanding of the Milky Way's dynamical history. Using TESS data, we build a series of rotation period measurement and confirmation pipelines and test them on 1,560 stars across five benchmark samples: the Pleiades, Pisces--Eridanus, Praesepe, the Hyades, and field stars from the MEarth Project. Our pipelines' recovery rates across these groups are on average 89\%. We then apply these pipelines to 4,085 likely single stars with TESS light curves in two interesting regions of Galactic action space. We identify 141 unique, rapidly rotating stars in highly eccentric orbits in the disk, some of which appear as rotationally young as the 120-Myr-old Pleiades. Pending spectroscopic analysis to confirm their youth, this indicates these stars were subject to fast-acting dynamical phenomena, the origin of which will be investigated in later papers in this series.
#### Growing Local arm inferred by the breathing motion

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical models of spiral arms suggest that the spiral arms provoke a vertical bulk motion in disc stars. By analysing the breathing motion, a coherent asymmetric vertical motion around the mid-plane of the Milky Way disc, with $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3, we found that a compressing breathing motion presents along the Local arm. On the other hand, with an $N$-body simulation of an isolated Milky Way-like disc galaxy, we found that the transient and dynamic spiral arms induce compressing breathing motions when the arms are in the growth phase, while the expanding breathing motion appears in the disruption phase. The observed clear alignment of the compressing breathing motion with the Local arm is similar to what is seen in the growth phase of the simulated spiral arms. Hence, we suggest that the Local arm's compressing breathing motion can be explained by the Local arm being in the growth phase of a transient and dynamic spiral arm. We also identified the tentative signatures of the expanding breathing motion associated with the Perseus arm and also the Outer arm coinciding with the compressing breathing motion. This may infer that the Perseus and Outer arms are in the disruption and growth phases, respectively.
#### GJ 357 d: Potentially Habitable World or Agent of Chaos?

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-planet systems provide important laboratories for exploring dynamical interactions within the range of known exoplanetary system architectures. One such system is GJ 357, consisting of a low-mass host star and three orbiting planets, the outermost (planet d) of which does not transit but lies within the Habitable Zone (HZ) of the host star. The minimum mass of planet d causes its nature to be unknown, both in terms of whether it is truly terrestrial and if it is a candidate for harboring surface liquid water. Here, we use three sectors of photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to show that planets c and d do not transit the host star, and therefore may have masses higher than the derived minimum masses. We present the results for a suite of dynamical simulations that inject an Earth-mass planet within the HZ of the system for three different orbital and mass configurations of planet d. These results show that planet d, rather than being a potentially habitable planet, is likely a source of significant orbital instability for other potential terrestrial planets within the HZ. We find that relatively small eccentricities of planet d cause a majority of the HZ to be unstable for an Earth-mass planet. These results highlight the importance of dynamical stability for systems that are prioritized in the context of planetary habitability.
#### Modelling of Long-Term Afterglow Counterparts to Gravitational Wave  Events: The Full View of GRB 170817A

 - **Abstract**
 The arrival of gravitational wave astronomy and a growing number of time-domain focused observatories are set to lead to a increasing number of detections of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) launched with a moderate inclination to Earth. Being nearby events, these are also prime candidates for very long-term follow-up campaigns and very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI), which has implications for multi-messenger modelling, data analysis, and statistical inference methods applied to these sources. Here we present a comprehensive modelling update that directly incorporates into afterglowpy astrometric observations of the GRB position, Poissonian statistics for faint sources, and modelling of a trans-relativistic population of electrons. We use the revolutionary event GW170817 to demonstrate the impact of these extensions both for the best-fit physics parameters and model selection methods that assess the statistical significance of additional late-time emission components. By including in our analysis the latest Chandra X-ray observations of GRB 170817A, we find only weak evidence (less than two sigma) for a new emission component at late times, which makes for a slightly more natural fit to the centroid evolution and prediction for the external medium density.
#### Construction of a Multidimensional Parallel Adaptive Mesh Refinement  Special Relativistic Hydrodynamics Code for Astrophysical Applications

 - **Abstract**
 We have developed a new computer code, RELDAFNA, to solve the conservative equations of special relativistic hydrodynamics (SRHD) using adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) on parallel computers. We have implemented a characteristic-wise, finite volume Godunov scheme using the full characteristic decomposition of the SRHD equations, to achieve second and third order accuracy in space (both PLM and PPM reconstruction). For time integration, we use the method of directional splitting with symmetrization, which is second order accurate in time. We have also implemented second and third order Runge-Kutta time integration scheme for comparison. In addition to the hydrodynamics solvers we have implemented approximate Riemann solvers along with an exact Riemann solver. We examine the ability of RELDAFNA to accurately simulate special relativistic flows efficiently in number of processors, computer memory and over all integration time. We show that a wide variety of test problems can be solved as accurately as solved by higher order programs, such as RAM, GENESIS, or PLUTO, but with a less number of variables kept in memory and computer calculations than most schemes, an advantage which is crucial for 3D high resolution simulations to be of practical use for scientific research in computational astrophysics. RELDAFNA has been tested in one, two and three dimensions and in Cartesian, cylindrical and spherical geometries. We present the ability of RELDAFNA to assist with the understanding of open questions in high energy astrophysics which involve relativistic flows.
#### Plausibility of Capture into High-Obliquity States for Exoplanets in the  M Dwarf Habitable Zone

 - **Abstract**
 For temperate exoplanets orbiting M dwarf hosts, the proximity of the habitable zone to the star necessitates careful consideration of tidal effects. Spin synchronization of the planetary orbital period and rotation period is a common assumption for habitable zone planets across the entire M spectral type. This predicted tidal locking has important implications for conditions on the surface. In this manuscript, we investigate the plausibility of capture into Cassini State 2 for a known sample of 280 multiplanet systems orbiting M dwarf hosts. This resonance of the spin precession and orbital precession frequencies is capable of exciting planets into stable nonzero rotational obliquities. A large axial tilt resulting from this predicted resonance capture can preclude synchronous rotation, inducing some version of "day" and "night." Considering each planetary pair and estimating the spin and orbital precession frequencies, we report that 75% of detected planets orbiting M dwarfs may be plausibly excited to a high obliquity over long timescales. This is consistent with similar findings for planets orbiting close-in to FGK dwarfs. However, it is only for M dwarf planets that the parameter space relevant for capture into Cassini State 2 overlaps with the stellar habitable zone. This effect is strongest for host stars with effective temperatures $T_{eff}<3000$ K, where more than half of planets with $T_{eq}<400$ K could possess non-zero obliquity due to residence in Cassini State 2. This overlap renders the potential capture into Cassini States extremely relevant to understanding the galaxy's most common temperate planets.
#### Black hole binary mergers in dense star clusters: the importance of  primordial binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Dense stellar clusters are expected to house the ideal conditions for binary black hole (BBH) formation, both through binary stellar evolution and through dynamical encounters. We use theoretical arguments as well as $N$-body simulations to make predictions for the evolution of BBHs formed through stellar evolution inside clusters from the cluster birth (which we term $\textbf{primordial binaries}$), and for the sub-population of merging BBHs. We identify three key populations: (i) BBHs that form in the cluster, and merge before experiencing any $\textit{strong}$ dynamical interaction; (ii) binaries that are ejected from the cluster after only one dynamical interaction; and, (iii) BBHs that experience more than one strong interaction inside the cluster. We find that populations (i) and (ii) are the dominant source of all BBH mergers formed in clusters with escape velocity $v_{\mathrm{esc}}\leq 30$ $\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. At higher escape velocities, dynamics are predicted to play a major role both for the formation and subsequent evolution of BBHs. Finally, we argue that for sub-Solar metallicity clusters with $v_{\mathrm{esc}}\lesssim100$ $\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, the dominant form of interaction experienced by primordial BBHs (BBHs formed from primordial binaries) within the cluster is with other BBHs. The complexity of these binary-binary interactions will complicate the future evolution of the BBH and influence the total number of mergers produced.
#### Disk Cooling and Wind Lines As Seen In the Spectral Line Evolution of  V960 Mon

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02465
 - **Abstract**
 We follow up our photometric study of the post-outburst evolution of the FU Ori object V960 Mon with a complementary spectroscopic study at high dispersion that uses time series spectra from Keck/HIRES. Consistent with the photometric results reported in Carvalho et al. 2023, we find that the spectral evolution of V960 Mon corresponds to a decrease in the temperature of the inner disk, driven by a combination of decreasing accretion rate and increasing inner disk radius. We also find that although the majority of the absorption lines are well-matched by our accretion disk model spectrum, there are several strong absorption line families and a few emission lines that are not captured by the model. By subtracting the accretion disk model from the data at each epoch, we isolate the wind/outflow components of the system. The residuals show both broad and highly blueshifted profiles, as well as narrow and only slightly blueshifted profiles, with some lines displaying both types of features.
#### Validating posteriors obtained by an emulator when jointly-fitting mock  data of the global 21-cm signal and high-z galaxy UV luminosity function

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02503
 - **Abstract**
 Although neural-network-based emulators enable efficient parameter estimation in 21-cm cosmology, the accuracy of such constraints is poorly understood. We employ nested sampling to fit mock data of the global 21-cm signal and high-$z$ galaxy ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) and compare for the first time the emulated posteriors obtained using the global signal emulator ${\tt globalemu}$ to the `true' posteriors obtained using the full model on which the emulator is trained using ${\tt ARES}$. Of the eight model parameters we employ, four control the star formation efficiency (SFE), and thus can be constrained by UVLF data, while the remaining four control UV and X-ray photon production, and the minimum virial temperature of star-forming halos ($T_{\rm min}$), and thus are uniquely probed by reionization and 21-cm measurements. For noise levels of 50 and 250 mK in the 21-cm data being jointly-fit, the emulated and `true' posteriors are consistent to within $1\sigma$. However, at lower noise levels of 10 and 25 mK, ${\tt globalemu}$ overpredicts $T_{\rm min}$ and underpredicts $\gamma_{\rm lo}$, an SFE parameter, by $\approx3-4\sigma$, while the `true' ${\tt ARES}$ posteriors capture their fiducial values within $1\sigma$. We find that jointly-fitting the mock UVLF and 21-cm data significantly improves constraints on the SFE parameters by breaking degeneracies in the ${\tt ARES}$ parameter space. Our results demonstrate the astrophysical constraints that can be expected for global 21-cm experiments for a range of noise levels from pessimistic to optimistic, and also the potential for probing redshift evolution of SFE parameters by including UVLF data.
#### Closed-Loop Until Further Notice: Comparing Predictive Control Methods  in Closed-Loop

 - **Abstract**
 For future extremely large telescopes, error in extreme adaptive optics systems at small angular separations will be highly impacted by the lag time of the correction, which is typically on millisecond timescales; one solution is to apply a predictive correction to catch up with the system delay. Predictive control leads to significant RMS error reductions in simulation (on the order of 5-10x improvement in RMS error compared with a standard integral controller), but shows only modest improvement on-sky (less than 2x in RMS error). This performance limitation is likely impacted by elements of pseudo open loop (POL) reconstruction, which requires assumptions about the response of the deformable mirror and accuracy of the wavefront measurements that are difficult to verify in practice. In this work, we explore a closed-loop method for data-driven prediction using a reformulated empirical orthogonal functions (EOF). We examine the performance of the open and closed-loop methods in simulation on perfect systems and systems with an inaccurate understanding of the DM response.
#### New Dynamical Channel: Wide Binaries in the Galactic Center as a Source  of Binary Interactions

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02558
 - **Abstract**
 The inner $500\rm pc$ in the galactic center is dense with stars and a dynamically hot environment. Here, we focus on wide binaries as a source of tidally or collisional interactions. These binaries were previously ignored as sources of binary interaction because they are too wide to have a close pericenter passage, or they will quickly become unbound (ionized) due to gravitational interactions with passing neighbors. However, we show that wide binaries tend to interact more frequently with neighboring stars due to their larger cross-section for gravitational impulse interactions. These interactions mainly torque the wide system, causing it to change its eccentricity. As a result, the eccentricity might be excited to sufficiently high values, causing the binary to interact at the pericenter. As a proof of concept, we present four channels of such interactions: binary main-sequence (MS), white-dwarf (WD) - MS, black hole - MS, and lastly, WD-WD. During Galaxy's lifetime, we predict tens of thousands of MS-MS interacting binaries that may form G2-like objects later appear younger than their environment. X-ray signatures and, perhaps, supernovae may result from thousands of WD-MS and WD-WD interacting binaries from this channel. Lastly, we predict a few hundred BH-MS interacting binaries at the inner $500$~pc.
#### Predicting Missing Light Curves of Gamma-Ray Bursts with  Bidirectional-LSTM: An Approach for Enhanced Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRB) are powerful transient events that emit a large output of gamma rays within a few seconds. Studying these short bursts is vital for cosmological research since they originate from sources observed at large redshifts. To effectively carry out these studies, it is crucial to establish a correlation between the observable features of GRBs while reducing their uncertainty. For these reasons, a comprehensive description of the general GRB light curve (LC) would be crucial for the studies. However, unevenly spaced observations and significant gaps in the LC, which are primarily unavoidable for various reasons, make it difficult to characterize GRBs. Therefore, the general classification of GRB LCs remains challenging. In this study, we present a novel approach to reconstruct gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves using bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM). Experimental results show that the BiLSTM approach performs better than traditional methods and produces smoother and more convincing reconstructions for GRBs.
#### Investigating the orbital evolution of the eccentric HMXB GX 301$-$2  using long-term X-ray lightcurves
 - **Authors:** Hemanth Manikantan, Manish Kumar, Biswajit Paul, Vikram Rana
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02626
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02626
 - **Abstract**
 We report the orbital decay rate of the high mass X-ray binary GX 301$-$2 from an analysis of its long-term X-ray light curves and pulsed flux histories from CGRO/BATSE, RXTE/ASM, Swift/BAT, Fermi/GBM and MAXI by timing the pre-periastron flares over a span of almost 30 years. The time of arrival of the pre-periastron flares exhibits an energy dependence (hard lag) and the orbital period decay was estimated after correcting for it. This method of orbital decay estimation is unaffected by the fluctuations in the spin rate of the X-ray pulsar associated with variations in the mass accretion rate. The resulting $\dot P_\textrm{orb}$ $=-(1.98\pm0.28)\times10^{-6}$ s s$^{-1}$ indicates a rapid evolution timescale of $|P_\textrm{orb}/\dot P_\textrm{orb}|\sim 0.6\times10^{5}$ yr, making it the high mass X-ray binary with the fastest orbital decay. Our estimate of $\dot P_\mathrm{orb}$ is off by a factor of $\sim2$ from the previously reported value of $-(3.7\pm0.5)\times10^{-6}$ s s$^{-1}$ estimated from pulsar TOA analysis. We discuss various possible mechanisms that could drive this rapid orbital decay and also suggest that GX 301$-$2 is a prospective Thorne-\.{Z}ytkow candidate.
#### Earth as an Exoplanet. III. Using Empirical Thermal Emission Spectra as  Input for Atmospheric Retrieval of an Earth-Twin Exoplanet

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02634
 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we treat Earth as an exoplanet and investigate our home planet by means of a potential future mid-infrared (MIR) space mission called the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). We combine thermal spectra from an empirical dataset of disk-integrated Earth observations with a noise model for LIFE to create mock observations. We apply a state-of-the-art atmospheric retrieval framework to characterize the planet, assess the potential for detecting the known bioindicators, and investigate the impact of viewing geometry, seasonality, and patchy clouds on the characterization. Key findings include: (1) we are observing a temperate habitable planet with significant abundances of CO2, H2O, O3, and CH4; (2) seasonal variations in the surface and equilibrium temperature, and in the Bond albedo are detectable; (3) the viewing geometry and the spatially and temporally unresolved nature of our observations only have a minor impact on the characterization; (4) Earth's variable H2O profile and patchy cloud coverage lead to biased retrieval results for the atmospheric structure and trace gas abundances; (5) the limited extent of Earth's seasonal variations in biosignature abundances makes the direct detection of its biosphere through atmospheric seasonality unlikely. Our results suggest that LIFE could correctly identify Earth as a planet where life could thrive, with detectable levels of bioindicators, a temperate climate, and surface conditions allowing liquid surface water. Even if atmospheric seasonality is not easily observed, our study demonstrates that next generation, optimized space missions can assess whether nearby temperate terrestrial exoplanets are habitable or even inhabited.
#### Stable accretion in young stars: The cases of EX Lupi and TW Hya

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the long-term spectroscopic and photometric variability of EX~Lupi and TW~Hya, studying the presence of stable accretion and the role it plays in the observed variability. Analysing the velocity modulations of the emission lines with STAR-MELT, we obtain information on the structure of the accretion columns and the disk-star connection. The emission line radial velocities reveal that TW Hya, like EX Lupi, has a remarkably stable or slow-varying accretion column footprint, locked to the star for several years. The line-emitting regions are non-polar for both EX Lupi and TW Hya, and species with different energies differ in position. In contrast, the continuum emission as observed in the photometry is very variable and can be modelled by hot spot(s) that change over time in phase, shape, temperature, size, and location with respect to the emission line region. The continuum emission region may not be limited to the stellar surface, especially during episodes of high accretion. The broad line emission observed in EX Lupi during episodes of increased accretion reveals a further structure, which can be fitted by non-axisymmetric disk in Keplerian rotation inwards of the corotation radius. Since the radial velocity modulation due to accretion footprints is so stable, we used it to search for further velocity modulations. While no residual modulation (other than caused by stellar rotation) is found in these objects, a similar analysis could help to identify young planets/companions. Therefore, determining whether stable accretion footprints are common among young stars is a key to detect young planets.
#### The LoReLi database: 21 cm signal inference with 3D radiative  hydrodynamics simulations

 - **Abstract**
 The Square Kilometer array is expected to measure the 21cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization in the coming decade, and its pathfinders may provide a statistical detection even earlier. Current reported upper limits start putting constraints on the astrophysical parameters of the models of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). In order to interpret such data with 3D radiative hydrodynamics simulations using Bayesian inference, we present the latest developments of the Licorice code. Relying mainly on an implementation of the halo Conditional Mass Function to account for unresolved star formation, they allow for accurate simulations of the EoR at $256^3$ resolution. We use this version of Licorice to produce the first iteration of LoReLi, a public dataset now containing hundreds of 21cm signals computed from radiative hydrodynamics simulations. We train a neural network on LoReLi to provide a fast emulator of the Licorice powerspectra, LorEMU, that has $\sim 5\%$ rms error relative to the simulated signals. LorEMU is used in an MCMC framework to perform Bayesian inference, first on a mock observation composed of a simulated signal and a thermal noise corresponding to 100h observations with the SKA. We then apply our inference pipeline to the latest measurements from the HERA interferometer. We report constraints on the X-ray emissivity, and confirm that cold reionization scenarios are unlikely to accurately represent our Universe.
#### Combing the Brown Dwarf Desert with Gaia DR3

 - **Abstract**
 We have created an up-to-date catalogue of 214 brown dwarfs (BDs) in binaries with $P < 10^4$ d. This allows us to examine the population statistics of the brown dwarf desert. We searched $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3 NSS results for orbital inclinations of BD candidates, deriving 12 new masses. Three remain as desert BDs whereas nine candidates are found to be low-mass stars. We improved the RV solutions for three previously studied BD candidates. A further 19 BD masses with periods less than $\sim$ 1200 d were identified in the DR3 $\texttt{binary_masses}$ database. We confirm a valley in the mass distribution with a minimum around 30-35 M$_{\textrm{jup}}$, and find that periods $<$ 100 d are still under-populated in comparison to longer periods. The updated mass and eccentricity distribution of BDs still shows a marginally statistically significant split into high- and low-mass BD populations. This hints at two different parent distributions, and two potential origins $-$ either akin to planetary formation, or stellar. There are no low eccentricity BDs at periods around 100 d. The mass-metallicity distribution of BDs indicates that core accretion is not the dominant formation mechanism for BDs as they do not follow the same trends that giant exoplanets do with metallicity. We identify a diagonal envelope bounding the Gaia BDs in the mass-period plane due to the detection thresholds of the currently available NSS solutions from 34 months of data.
#### Exploring the Brown Dwarf Desert with Precision Radial Velocities and  Gaia DR3 Astrometric Orbits

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The observed scarcity of brown dwarfs in close orbits (within 10 au) around solar-type stars poses significant questions about the origins of these substellar companions. These questions impact our broader understanding of planetary formation processes. However, to resolve these formation mechanisms, accurate observational constraints are essential. Most of the brown dwarfs have been discovered by radial velocity surveys, but this method introduces uncertainties due to its inability to determine the orbital inclination, leaving the true mass-and thus their true nature-unresolved. This highlights the crucial role of astrometric data, helping us distinguish between genuine brown dwarfs and stars. Aims. We aim to refine the mass estimates of massive companions to solar-type stars, mostly discovered through radial velocity measurements and subsequently validated using Gaia DR3 astrometry, to gain a clearer understanding of their true mass and occurrence rates. Methods. We selected a sample of 31 sources with substellar companion candidates validated by Gaia DR3 and with available radial velocities. Using the Gaia DR3 solutions as prior information, we performed an MCMC fit with the available radial velocity measurements to integrate these two sources of data and thus obtain an estimate of their true mass. Results. Combining radial velocity measurements with Gaia DR3 data led to more precise mass estimations, leading us to reclassify several systems initially labeled as brown dwarfs as low-mass stars. Out of the 32 analyzed companions, 13 are determined to be stars, 17 are sub-stellar, and 2 have inconclusive results with the current data. Importantly, using these updated masses, we reevaluated the occurrence rate of brown dwarf companions (13-80 M$_{jup}$ ) on close orbits (<10 au) in the CORALIE sample, determining a tentative occurrence rate of $0.8^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\%$

 - **Abstract**
 Nearby associations are ideal regions to study coeval samples of protoplanetary and debris disks down to late M-type stars. Those aged 5-10,Myrs, where most of the disk should have already dissipated forming planets, are of particular interest. We present the first complete study of both protoplanetary and debris disks in a young region, using the $\eta$ Chamaeleontis association as a test bench to study the cold disk content. We obtained sub-millimeter data for the entire core population down to late M-type stars, plus a few halo members. We performed a continuum sub-millimeter survey with APEX/LABOCA of all the core populations of $\eta$ Cha association. Disk properties have been derived by modeling protoplanetary and debris disks using RADMC 2D and DMS, respectively. We find that protoplanetary disks in $\eta$ Cha typically have holes with radii of the order of 0.01 to 0.03 AU, while ring-like emission from the debris disks is located between 20 au and 650 au from the central star. The parallaxes and Gaia eDR3 photometry, in combination with the PARSEC and COLIBRI isochrones, enable us to confirm an age of $\eta$ Cha between 7 and 9 Myrs. In general, the disk mass seems insufficient to support accretion over a long time, even for the lowest mass accretors, a clear difference compared with other regions and also a sign that the mass budget is further underestimated. We do not find a correlation between the stellar masses, accretion rates, and disk masses, although this could be due to sample issues. We confirm that the presence of inner holes is not enough to stop accretion unless accompanied by dramatic changes to the total disk mass content. Comparing $\eta$ Cha with other regions at different ages, we find that the physical processes responsible for debris disks (e.g., dust growth, dust trapping) efficiently act in less than 5 Myrs.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a series of 3D simulations to study the accretion of giant planet embedded in protoplanetary discs (PPDs) over gap-opening timescales. We find that the accretion mass flux mainly comes from the intermediate latitude above the disc midplane. The circumplanetary disc (CPD) for a super-thermal planet is rotation-supported up to $\sim$20-30\% of the planet Hill radius. While both mass inflow and outflow exists in the CPD midplane, the overall trend is an outflow that forms a meridional circulation with high-latitude inflows. We confirm the absence of accretion outburst from disc eccentricity excited by massive planets in our 3D simulations, contrary to the consensus of previous 2D simulations. This suggests the necessity of 3D simulations of accretion even for super-Jupiters. The accretion rates of planets measured in steady-state can be decomposed into the ``geometric" and ``density depletion" factors. Through extensive parameter survey, we identify a power-law scaling for the geometric factor $\propto q_{\rm th}^{2/3}$ for super-thermal planets ($q_{\rm th}$ being the thermal mass ratio), which transforms to $\propto q_{\rm th}^{2}$ for less massive cases. The density depletion factor is limited by the disc accretion rate for mildly super-thermal planets, and by gap-opening for highly super-thermal ones. Moderate planetary eccentricities can enhance the accretion rates by a factor of $2-3$ through making the gap shallower, but does not impact the flow geometry. We have applied our simulations results to accreting protoplanet system PDS 70 and can satisfactorily explain the accretion rate and CPD size in observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Class II CH3OH masers are used as a convenient tracer of disc-like structures in high-mass star formation. However, more than half of them show a complex distribution in Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) maps. The origin of such a complex distribution is still unknown. We conducted VLBI monitoring observations to unveil the origin of a complex class II CH3OH maser in the high-mass star-forming region G59.783+0.065. We observed the CH3OH maser at 6.7 GHz and the H2O maser at 22 GHz to probe detailed circumstellar kinematics and structures by the Japanese VLBI network and the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry. We found similar bipolar distributions in both masers, specifically two clusters located 2000 au apart along the East-West direction. We detected a linear distribution of CH3OH masers in the Western cluster. A position-velocity diagram shows that the Western CH3OH masers trace a rotating disc-wind or infalling component inside an edge-on disc-like structure. In contrast to the simple bipolar expanding motions of the H2O masers, the CH3OH masers exhibited complex motions despite their spatial coincidence. Some of the Eastern CH3OH masers showed bipolar expansions similar to the H2O masers, while others displayed random or even inward motions. Such complex kinematics and their close association with the H2O maser could occur at the boundary between outflow and inflow. We suggest that the complex distribution of class II CH3OH masers, like G59.783+0.065 arises from several distinct circumstellar structures that simultaneously achieve maser excitation.

 - **Abstract**
 We studied the timing and spectral properties of the Be/X-ray pulsar Swift J1626.6-5156 using the \emph{NICER} observations of its 2021 outburst. The most important observation is the positive correlation of the centroid energy of the fundamental cyclotron line with the luminosity. This observation agrees with the usual positive correlation of the centroid energy cyclotron line with luminosity in the sub-critical regime. The correlation between the two quantities is verified using two different continuum models. The photon index decreases with an increase in flux. Thus, the spectrum is softer when the flux is low, which may be due to a decrease in the optical depth of the accretion column with a decrease in the flux.

 - **Abstract**
 The asteroid belt is a unique source of information on some of the most important questions facing solar system science. These questions include the sizes, numbers, types and orbital distributions of the planetesimals that formed the planets, and the identification of those asteroids that are the sources of meteorites and near-Earth asteroids. Answering these questions requires an understanding of the dynamical evolution of the asteroid belt, but this evolution is governed by a complex interplay of mechanisms that include catastrophic disruption, orbital evolution driven by Yarkovsky radiation forces, and chaotic orbital evolution driven by gravitational forces. While the timescales of these loss mechanisms have been calculated using estimates of some critical parameters that include the thermal properties, strengths and mean densities of the asteroids, we argue here that the uncertainties in these parameters are so large that deconvolution of the structure of the asteroid belt must be guided primarily by observational constraints. We argue that observations of the inner asteroid belt indicate that the size-frequency distribution is not close to the equilibrium distribution postulated by Dohnanyi (1969). We also discuss the correlations observed between the sizes and the orbital elements of the asteroids. While some of these correlations are significant and informative, others are spurious and may arise from the limitations of the Hierarchical Clustering Method that is currently used to define family membership.
#### Composition of giant planets: the roles of pebbles and planetesimals

 - **Abstract**
 One of the current challenges of planet formation theory is to explain the enrichment of observed exoplanetary atmospheres. Past studies have focused on scenarios where either pebbles or planetesimals were the heavy element enrichment's drivers, we combine here both approaches to understand whether the composition of a planet can constrain its formation pathway. We study three different formation scenarios: pebble accretion, pebble accretion with planetesimal formation, combined pebble and planetesimal accretion. We use the chemcomp code to perform semi-analytical 1D simulations of protoplanetary discs, including viscous evolution, pebble drift, and simple chemistry to simulate the growth of planets from planetary embryos to gas giants as they migrate through the disc, while tracking their composition. Our simulations confirm that the composition of the planetary atmosphere is dominated by the accretion of gas enriched by inward drifting and evaporating pebbles. Including planetesimal formation hinders the enrichment, because the pebbles locked into planetesimals cannot evaporate and enrich the disc. This results in a big drop of the accreted heavy elements both in the planetesimal formation and accretion case, proving that planetesimal formation needs to be inefficient in order to explain planets with high heavy element content. Accretion of planetesimals enhances the refractory component of the atmosphere, leading to low volatile to refractory ratios, contrary to the pure pebble scenario. Such low volatile to refractory ratios can also be achieved by planets migrating in the inner disc in pure pebble scenario. Distinguishing these two scenarios requires knowledge about the planet's atmospheric C/H and O/H ratios, which are higher for pure pebble accretion. Therefore, a detailed knowledge of the composition of planetary atmospheres could help to constrain the planet's formation pathway.

 - **Abstract**
 Using deep archival observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we present an analysis of linear X-ray-emitting features located within the southern portion of the Galactic center chimney, and oriented orthogonal to the Galactic plane, centered at coordinates l = 0.08 deg, b = -1.42 deg. The surface brightness and hardness ratio patterns are suggestive of a cylindrical morphology which may have been produced by a plasma outflow channel extending from the Galactic center. Our fits of the feature's spectra favor a complex two-component model consisting of thermal and recombining plasma components, possibly a sign of shock compression or heating of the interstellar medium by outflowing material. Assuming a recombining plasma scenario, we further estimate the cooling timescale of this plasma to be on the order of a few hundred to thousands of years, leading us to speculate that a sequence of accretion events onto the Galactic Black Hole may be a plausible quasi-continuous energy source to sustain the observed morphology.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the angular distribution of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations to probe the statistical isotropy of the universe by using precise full-sky CMB data with a model-independent approach. We investigate the temperature-temperature angular correlations in the four Planck foreground-cleaned CMB maps, recently released. This study performs a directional analysis on the CMB sphere looking for directions where temperature-temperature angular correlations are extremes. Our analyses confirm a preferred axis in the CMB sphere, pointing in the direction $(l,b) \simeq (250^{\circ}, 130^{\circ})$, at $98\%$-$99\%$ confidence level, direction where the CMB angular correlations show the maximum excess over the antipodal direction. This preferred direction is unexpected in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, and represents a significant deviation compared to results obtained applying the same procedure to simulated statistically isotropic CMB maps. This result confirms the North-South asymmetry in the most recent Planck data, a phenomenon that is one of the previously reported CMB anomalies. We perform a robust detection of the North-South asymmetry in the temperature-temperature angular correlations -- with slightly different statistical significance -- in the four Planck foreground-cleaned CMB maps. Moreover, we perform consistency tests by adding foregrounds and noise, both Planck data products, to the CMB map in study, and also investigate and discard possible bias in our methodology. After these detailed analyses we conclude that the North-South asymmetry phenomenon is present, with high statistical significance, in the Planck CMB maps studied, result that confirms previous reports in the literature in the last 20 years.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the potential of the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), an unsupervised machine learning method, to identify coherent physical structures in the ISM. The implementation we present can be used on any kind of spatially and spectrally resolved data set. We provide a step-by-step guide to use these models on different sources and data sets. Following the guide, we run the models on NGC 1977, RCW 120 and RCW 49 using the [CII] 158 $\mu$m mapping observations from the SOFIA telescope. We find that the models identified 6, 4 and 5 velocity coherent physical structures in NGC 1977, RCW 120 and RCW 49, respectively, which are validated by analysing the observed spectra towards these structures and by comparison to earlier findings. In this work we demonstrate that GMM is a powerful tool that can better automate the process of spatial and spectral analysis to interpret mapping observations.
#### Apparent luminosity and pulsed fraction affected by gravitational  lensing of accretion columns in bright X-ray pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 The luminosity of X-ray pulsars is their key parameter determining the geometry and physical conditions of the accretion flow both on the spatial scales of a binary system and on much smaller scales of emitting regions located close to the stellar surface. Traditionally, the luminosity of X-ray pulsars is estimated out of the X-ray energy flux averaged over the pulsed period and the estimated distance to the source. Due to the anisotropy of X-ray emission, the luminosity estimated on the base of the observed pulse profile can differ from the actual one. Super-critical X-ray pulsars with accretion columns are of particular interest because the X-ray flux from columns is a matter of strong gravitational lensing by a neutron star. Using toy model of an accretion column, we simulate beam patterns in super-critical X-ray pulsars, construct theoretical pulse profiles for different geometries and mutual orientations of pulsars and distant observers and show that despite strong light bending, the typical deviation of the apparent luminosity from the actual one is $\sim 20\%$ only, and in $\sim 90\%$ of cases, the apparent luminosity $0.8 L\lesssim L_{\rm app}\lesssim 1.25 L$. However, the shape of the pulse profiles is strongly affected by the geometry of the emitting region. We show that the appearance and growth of accretion columns tend to be accompanied by an increase of observed pulsed fraction, which is in agreement with the recent observations of bright X-ray transients.

 - **Abstract**
 EUSO-SPB2 (Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon II) is a precursor mission for a future space observatory for multi-messenger astrophysics, planned to be launched in Spring 2023 with a flight duration target of 100 days. The Fluorescence Telescope (FT) hosted on board is designed to detect Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays via the UV fluorescence emission of the Extensive Air Showers in the atmosphere. The Data Processor (DP) of the FT is the component of the electronics system that performs data management and instrument control for the telescope. The DP controls front-end electronics, tags events with arrival time and payload position through a GPS system, provides signals for time synchronization of the event and measures the live and dead time of the telescope. Furthermore, it manages mass memory for data storage, performs housekeeping monitoring, and controls the power-on and power-off sequences. Finally, the data processor combines the data from the PDMs and onboard differential GPS and prioritizes data for download. The long duration of the flight poses strict requirements on electronics and data handling. The operations at high altitude in an unpressurized environment represent a technological challenge for heat dissipation. This contribution will provide an overview of the innovative elements developed and the results of the integration and field test campaigns. We will also present some preliminary analysis of the performance during the flight.
