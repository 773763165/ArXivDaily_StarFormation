 - **Abstract**
 A major endeavor of this decade is the direct characterization of young giant exoplanets at high spectral resolution to determine the composition of their atmosphere and infer their formation processes and evolution. Such a goal represents a major challenge owing to their small angular separation and luminosity contrast with respect to their parent stars. Instead of designing and implementing completely new facilities, it has been proposed to leverage the capabilities of existing instruments that offer either high contrast imaging or high dispersion spectroscopy, by coupling them using optical fibers. In this work we present the implementation and first on-sky results of the HiRISE instrument at the very large telescope (VLT), which combines the exoplanet imager SPHERE with the recently upgraded high resolution spectrograph CRIRES using single-mode fibers. The goal of HiRISE is to enable the characterization of known companions in the $H$ band, at a spectral resolution of the order of $R = \lambda/\Delta\lambda = 100\,000$, in a few hours of observing time. We present the main design choices and the technical implementation of the system, which is constituted of three major parts: the fiber injection module inside of SPHERE, the fiber bundle around the telescope, and the fiber extraction module at the entrance of CRIRES. We also detail the specific calibrations required for HiRISE and the operations of the instrument for science observations. Finally, we detail the performance of the system in terms of astrometry, temporal stability, optical aberrations, and transmission, for which we report a peak value of $\sim$3.9% based on sky measurements in median observing conditions. Finally, we report on the first astrophysical detection of HiRISE to illustrate its potential.
#### A Phenomenon Resembling Early Superhumps in a New SU UMa-Type Dwarf Nova  with a 2-Hour Orbital Period

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate K2BS5, an optical transient that we identified in Campaign 13 of the Kepler/K2 archives by the "K2 Background Survey", and classify it as a new SU UMa-type dwarf nova. Using the light curve generated from Kepler's long-cadence observation mode, we analyze the dwarf nova during quiescence and superoutburst. Following 20 days of quiescence at the start of the observation, the system entered a superoutburst lasting 12 days, after which it experienced at least one rebrightening. K2BS5 clearly meets the criteria for an SU UMa star, but at the peak of the superoutburst, it also shows double-wave oscillations consistent with the spectroscopic orbital period, a phenomenon that closely resembles early superhumps in WZ Sge stars. While we do not classify K2BS5 as a WZ Sge system, we discuss how this phenomenon could complicate efforts to use the suspected detection of early superhumps to distinguish SU UMa-type dwarf novae from the recently recognized class of long-orbital-period WZ Sge systems.
#### Search for Dark Matter Annihilation Signals in the Galactic Center Halo  with VERITAS

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12403
 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray observations of the Galactic Center (GC) region provide some of the most sensitive measurements of annihilation signals from dark matter in the GeV-TeV mass range. We present the first results from 178 hours of VERITAS observations of a 2 degree region around the GC, taken between 2010 and 2022. The analysis uses a newly-developed template-based background method, as well as analysis techniques optimized for observations taken at large zenith angles. No significant excess is found in any region of interest considered. We derive model-independent limits on the dark matter thermally-averaged annihilation cross section which are among the strongest from any indirect detection experiment for TeV-scale masses.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12410
 - **Abstract**
 We have studied a star-forming complex S193 using near-infrared (NIR) observations and other archival data covering optical to radio wavelengths. We identified stellar clusters in the complex using the NIR photometric data and estimated the membership and distance of the clusters. Using the mid-infrared (MIR) and far-infrared (FIR) images, the distribution of the dust emission around H\,{\sc ii} regions is traced in the complex. The $Herschel$ column density and temperature maps analysis reveal 16 cold dust clumps in the complex. The H$\alpha$ image and 1.4 GHz radio continuum emission map are employed to study the ionised gas distribution and infer the spectral type and the dynamical age of each H\,{\sc ii} region/ionised clump in the complex. The $^{12}$CO(J =3$-$2) and $^{13}$CO(J =1$-$0) molecular line data hint at the presence of two velocity components around [-43,-46] and [-47,-50] km/s, and their spatial distribution reveals two overlapping zones toward the complex. By investigating the immediate surroundings of the central cluster [BDS2003]57 and the pressure calculations, we suggest that the feedback from the massive stars seems responsible for the observed velocity gradient and might have triggered the formation of the central cluster [BDS2003]57.}

 - **Abstract**
 The NectarCAM is a camera that will be mounted on the Medium-Sized Telescopes of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatory. Along with the hardware integration of the camera, the scientific software, $\texttt{nectarchain}$, is being developed. The software is responsible for transforming the raw data from the camera into analysis-ready calibrated data. In this contribution, we present the structure of the software, which consists of two modules: the calibration pipeline and the data quality check pipeline. The calibration pipeline reduces the data, performs flat fielding, and determines the gain for the analysis. The data quality monitoring pipeline is used to select the data that meets the necessary standards for analysis. Additionally, we discuss the format of the downstream data and the integration of the $\texttt{nectarchain}$ modules in the general software framework of CTA. We also present the necessary tests for validating each part of the code. We conclude by mentioning the prospects for the future of the software.

 - **Abstract**
 The Astronomical Genealogy Project (AstroGen) has been underway since January 2013. This project of the Historical Astronomy Division (HAD) of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) has been online since July 2020, courtesy of the AAS. The volunteers of the AstroGen team have systematically searched online directories, mostly at individual university libraries, for astronomy-related doctoral theses equivalent to the modern, research-based Ph.D. We now claim to be 'nearly complete' for 38 countries, although some have not been updated for a year or two or three. The website contains a page for each astronomer and advisor, with links to the persons, universities, institutes, and the theses themselves. More than two-thirds of the theses are online in full, although some require access to a library with a subscription. There is information about nearly 37,000 individuals who have earned astronomy-related doctorates and another 5400 who have supervised them, but may not have earned such degrees themselves. Most of the latter have not yet been evaluated, but probably a majority earned doctorates in other fields, such as physics or geology. We present some of the results of our research and discuss ten ways the reader might make use of the project.
#### CRIRES-POP: a library of high resolution spectra in the near-infrared.  III. Line identification in the K-giant 10 Leo

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12467
 - **Abstract**
 Context: High-resolution spectra in the near-infrared (NIR) are an important tool for the detailed study of stellar atmospheres. The accurate identification of elements and molecules in these spectra can be used to determine chemical abundances and physical conditions in the photosphere of the observed star. Such identifications require precise line positions and strengths of both atomic and molecular features. Aims: This work focusses on the full identification of absorption lines in the NIR spectrum of the K-giant 10 Leo, including previously unidentified lines. The large number and complexity of the observed absorption lines require a deep search for potential spectral signatures to enable an unambiguous assignment to specific elements or molecular species. We aim to improve the published line lists of metals, some of which are determined by model calculations only, and many of which presently lack the completeness and accuracy of line parameters. Methods: The CRIRES-POP project provided high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectra of several bright stars in the 1 to 5 $\mu$m range. For the K-giant 10 Leo, a spectrum corrected for telluric absorption and with precise wavelength calibration is available. This has been analysed by comparison with model spectra and up-to-date line lists. Results: We identified lines of 29 elements and eight molecular species. While the positions of many known lines could be confirmed, about 6% of all lines detected in 10 Leo could not be attributed to any known feature. For CO and its isotopologues, molecular constants could be derived and several additional lines identified. We report major inconsistencies for some prominent lines. In addition, abundances for several key elements in 10 Leo are provided.
#### Revealing the Chemical Structure of the Magellanic Clouds with APOGEE.  II. Abundance Gradients of the Large Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 We present the abundance gradients of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) for 25 elemental abundance ratios and their respective temporal evolution as well as age-[X/Fe] trends using 6130 LMC field red giant branch (RGB) stars observed by SDSS-IV / APOGEE-2S. APOGEE is a high resolution ($R$ $\sim$22,500) $H$-band spectroscopic survey that gathered data on the LMC with broad radial and azimuthal coverage out to $\sim$10\degr. The calculated overall metallicity gradient of the LMC with no age binning is $-$0.0380 $\pm$ 0.0022 dex/kpc. We also find that many of the abundance gradients show a U-shaped trend as functions of age. This trend is marked by a flattening of the gradient but then a general steepening at more recent times. The extreme point at which all these gradients (with the U-shaped trend) begin to steepen is $\gtrsim$2 Gyr ago. In addition, some of the age-[X/Fe] trends show an increase starting a few Gyr before the extreme point in the gradient evolutions. A subset of the age-[X/Fe] trends also show maxima concurrent with the gradients' extreme points, further pinpointing a major event in the history of the LMC $\sim$2 Gyr ago. This time frame is consistent with a previously proposed interaction between the Magellanic Clouds suggesting that this is most likely the cause of the distinct trend in the gradients and age-[X/Fe] trends.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent experiments show that the desorption energy of H$_2$ on a diamond-like carbon (DLC) surface depends on the H$_2$ coverage of the surface. We aim to quantitatively explain the coverage dependent H$_2$ desorption energy measured by the experiments. We derive a math formula to calculate an effective H$_2$ desorption energy based on the encounter desorption mechanism. The effective H$_2$ desorption energy depends on two key parameters, the desorption energy of H$_2$ on H$_2$ substrate and the ratio of H$_2$ diffusion barrier to its desorption energy. The calculated effective H$_2$ desorption energy qualitatively agrees with the coverage dependent H$_2$ desorption energy measured by the experiments if the values of these two parameters in literature are used in the calculations. We argue that the difference between the effective H$_2$ desorption energy and the experimental results is due to the lacking of knowledge about these two parameters. So, we recalculate these two parameters based on experimental data. Good agreement between theoretical and experimental results can be achieved if these two updated parameters are used in the calculations.
#### Population synthesis of exoplanets accounting for orbital variations due  to stellar evolution

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12635
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, the evolution of exoplanet orbits at the late stages of stellar evolution is studied by the method of population synthesis. The evolution of stars is traced from the Main Sequence stage to the white dwarf stage. The MESA package is used to calculate evolutionary tracks. The statistics of absorbed, ejected, and surviving planets by the time of the transformation of parent stars into white dwarfs are calculated taking into account the change in the rate of star formation in the Galaxy over the entire time of its existence. Planets around stars in the range of initial masses 1-8 $M_\odot$ are considered since less massive stars do not have time to leave the Main Sequence during the lifetime of the Galaxy, and more massive ones do not lead to the formation of white dwarfs. It is shown that with the initial $a$~--~$M_\mathrm{pl}$ distribution of planets adopted in this work, most (about 60\%) of the planets born from stars in the mass range under study are absorbed by their parent stars at the giant stage. A small fraction of the planets (less than one percent) are ejected from their systems because of the mass loss due to the stellar wind. The estimated number of ejected planets with masses ranging from 0.04 Earth masses to 13 Jupiter masses in the Milky way is approximately equal to 300 million.
#### Maximum gravitational mass $M_{\rm TOV}=2.25^{+0.08}_{-0.07}M_\odot$  inferred at about $3\%$ precision with multimessenger data of neutron stars

 - **Abstract**
 The maximal gravitational mass of nonrotating neutron stars ($M_{\rm TOV}$) is one of the key parameters of compact objects and only loose bounds can be set based on the first principle. With reliable measurements of the masses and/or radii of the neutron stars, $M_{\rm TOV}$ can be robustly inferred from either the mass distribution of these objects or the reconstruction of the equation of state (EoS) of the very dense matter. For the first time we take the advantages of both two approaches to have a precise inference of $M_{\rm TOV}=2.25^{+0.08}_{-0.07}~M_\odot$ (68.3% credibility), with the updated neutron star mass measurement sample, the mass-tidal deformability data of GW170817, the mass-radius data of PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, as well as the theoretical information from the chiral effective theory ($\chi$EFT) and perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) at low and very high energy densities, respectively. This narrow credible range is benefited from the suppression of the high $M_{\rm TOV}$ by the pQCD constraint and the exclusion of the low $M_{\rm TOV}$ by the mass function. Three different EoS reconstruction methods are adopted separately, and the resulting $M_{\rm TOV}$ are found to be almost identical. This precisely evaluated $M_{\rm TOV}$ suggests that the EoS of neutron star matter is just moderately stiff and the $\sim 2.5-3M_\odot$ compact objects detected by the second generation gravitational wave detectors are most likely the lightest black holes.
#### Revised gas-phase formation network of methyl cyanide: the origin of  methyl cyanide and methanol abundance correlation in hot corinos

 - **Abstract**
 Methyl cyanide (CH$_3$CN) is one of the most abundant and widely spread interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs). Several studies found that, in hot corinos, methyl cyanide and methanol abundances are correlated suggesting a chemical link, often interpreted as a synthesis of them on the interstellar grain surfaces. In this article, we present a revised network of the reactions forming methyl cyanide in the gas-phase. We carried out an exhaustive review of the gas-phase CH$_3$CN formation routes, propose two new reactions and performed new quantum mechanics computations of several reactions. We found that 13 of the 15 reactions reported in the databases KIDA and UDfA have incorrect products and/or rate constants. The new corrected reaction network contains 10 reactions leading to methyl cyanide. We tested the relative importance of those reactions in forming CH$_3$CN using our astrochemical model. We confirm that the radiative association of CH${_3}{^+}$ and HCN, forming CH$_{3}$CNH$^{+}$, followed by the electron recombination of CH$_{3}$CNH$^{+}$, is the most important CH$_3$CN formation route in both cold and warm environments, notwithstanding that we significantly corrected the rate constants and products of both reactions. The two newly proposed reactions play an important role in warm environments. Finally, we found a very good agreement between the CH$_3$CN predicted abundances with those measured in cold ($\sim$10 K) and warm ($\sim$90 K) objects. Unexpectedly, we also found a chemical link between methanol and methyl cyanide via the CH$_{3}^{+}$ ion, which can explain the observed correlation between the CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN abundances measured in hot corinos.
#### Dust Emission and Dynamics

 - **Abstract**
 When viewed from Earth, most of what we observe of a comet is dust. The influence of solar radiation pressure on the trajectories of dust particles depends on their cross-section to mass ratio. Hence solar radiation pressure acts like a mass spectrometer inside a cometary tail. The appearances of cometary dust tails have long been studied to obtain information on the dust properties, such as characteristic particle size and initial velocity when entering the tail. Over the past two decades, several spacecraft missions to comets have enabled us to study the dust activity of their targets at much greater resolution than is possible with a telescope on Earth or in near-Earth space, and added detail to the results obtained by the spacecraft visiting comet 1P/Halley in 1986. We now know that the dynamics of dust in the inner cometary coma is complex and includes a significant fraction of particles that will eventually fall back to the surface. The filamented structure of the near-surface coma is thought to result from a combination of topographic focussing of the gas flow, inhomogeneous distribution of activity across the surface, and projection effects. It is possible that some larger-than-centimetre debris contains ice when lifted from the surface, which can affect its motion. Open questions remain regarding the microphysics of the process that leads to the detachment and lifting of dust from the surface, the evolution of the dust while travelling away from the nucleus, and the extent to which information on the nucleus activity can be retrieved from remote observations of the outer coma and tail.
#### Insights into the properties of GRBs with TeV emission

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the environments and characteristics of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) exhibiting very high energy (VHE) emission. Recent detections of VHE emission, up to TeV energies, challenge synchrotron-only emission models and particle acceleration concepts in GRBs. Until now, only a handful of GRBs have been detected in the VHE range. We compare the number densities of the circumburst medium of VHE-detected GRBs to check if the environment impacts the VHE emission. This shows that these GRBs have environments similar to the larger population of GRBs. We employ machine learning algorithms to create two-dimensional embeddings of GRB prompt emission light curves from the {\it Swift}-BAT catalog. VHE-detected GRBs are located across the map, indicating that VHE emission does not favour any particular cluster. These findings indicate that VHE-detected GRBs do not show any peculiar characteristics other than the observational detection of VHE photons. Future detections will increase the sample size required for a rigorous understanding of the origin of VHE emission in GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Electron capture (EC) decay relies on attachment and stripping cross-sections, that in turn, depend on the atomic number of the nucleus. We revisit the impact of EC decay in the context of the high-precision cosmic-ray fluxes measured by the AMS-02 experiment. We derive the solution of the steady-state fluxes in a 1D thin disk model including EC decay. We compare our results with relevant elemental and isotopic fluxes and evaluate the impact of this process, given the precision of recent AMS-02, ACE-CRIS, SuperTIGER, and Voyager data. We find this impact to be at the level or larger than the precision of recently collected data for several species, e.g. $_{31}$Ga and $_{33}$As, indicating that EC decay must be properly taken into account in the calculation.
#### Thermodynamic limits on oxygenic photosynthesis around M-dwarf stars:  Generalized models and strategies for optimization

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the feasibility and potential characteristics of photosynthetic light-harvesting on exo-planets orbiting in the habitable zone of low mass stars ($< 1$ M$_{\odot}$). As stellar temperature, $T_{s}$, decreases, the irradiance maximum red-shifts out of the $400 \textrm{nm} \leq \lambda < 750$ nm range of wavelengths that can be utilized by \emph{oxygenic} photosynthesis on Earth. However, limited irradiance in this region does not preclude oxygenic photosynthesis and Earth's plants, algae and cyanobacteria all possess very efficient \emph{light-harvesting antennae} that facilitate photosynthesis in very low light. Here we construct general models of photosynthetic light-harvesting structures to determine how an oxygenic photosystem would perform in different irradiant spectral fluxes. We illustrate that the process of light-harvesting, capturing energy over a large antenna and concentrating it into a small \emph{reaction centre}, must overcome a fundamental \emph{entropic barrier}. We show that a plant-like antenna cannot be adapted to the light from stars of $T_{s}<3400$ K, as increasing antenna size offers diminishing returns on light-harvesting. This can be overcome if one introduces a slight \emph{enthalpic gradient}, to the antenna. Interestingly, this strategy appears to have been adopted by Earth's oxygenic cyanobacteria, and we conclude that \emph{bacterial} oxygenic photosynthesis is feasible around even the lowest mass M-dwarf stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Mini-EUSO is a small, near-UV telescope observing the Earth and its atmosphere from the International Space Station. The time resolution of 2.5 microseconds and the instantaneous ground coverage of about $320\times 320$ km$^2$ allows it to detect some Transient Luminous Events, including Elves. Elves, with their almost circular shape and a radius expanding in time form cone-like structures in space-time, which are usually easy to be recognised by the eye, but not simple to filter out from the myriad of other events, many of them not yet categorised. In this work, we present a fast and efficient approach for detecting Elves in the data using a 3D CNN-based one-class classifier.
#### Latitudinal Propagation of Thermal Rossby Waves in Stellar Convection  Zones

 - **Abstract**
 Using an analytic model, we derive the eigenfrequencies for thermal Rossby waves that are trapped radially and latitudinally in an isentropically stratified atmosphere. We ignore the star's curvature and work in an equatorial f-plane geometry. The propagation of inertial waves is found to be sensitive to the relative direction of the wave vector to the zonal direction. Prograde propagating thermal Rossby waves are naturally trapped in the radial direction for frequencies above a critical threshold, which depends on the angle of propagation. Below the threshold frequency, there exists a continuous spectrum of prograde and retrograde inertial waves that are untrapped in an isentropic atmosphere, but can be trapped by gradients in the specific entropy density such as occurs in a stellar convection zone. Finally, we discuss the implications of these waves on recent observations of inertial oscillations in the Sun, as well as in numerical simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Our goal is to study the gravitational effects caused by the passage of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) in its orbit on the stellar halo of the Milky Way (MW). We employed the Gaia Data Release 3 to construct a halo tracers data set consisting of K-Giant stars and RR-Lyrae variables. Additionally, we have compared the data with a theoretical model to estimate the DM subhalo mass. We have improved the characterisation of the local wake and the collective response due to the LMC orbit. On the other hand, we have estimated for the first time the dark subhalo mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud, of the order of $2\times 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$, comparable to previously reported values in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST NIRCam observations at 1.5-4.5 $\mu$m have provided broad and narrow band imaging of the evolving remnant of SN 1987A with unparalleled sensitivity and spatial resolution. Comparing with previous marginally spatially resolved Spitzer IRAC observations from 2004-2019 confirms that the emission arises from the circumstellar equatorial ring (ER), and the current brightness at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m was accurately predicted by extrapolation of the declining brightness tracked by IRAC. Despite the regular light curve, the NIRCam observations clearly reveal that much of this emission is from a newly developing outer portion of the ER. Spots in the outer ER tend to lie at position angles in between the well-known ER hotspots. We show that the bulk of the emission in the field can be represented by 5 standard spectral energy distributions (SEDs), each with a distinct origin and spatial distribution. This spectral decomposition provides a powerful technique for distinguishing overlapping emission from the circumstellar medium (CSM) and the supernova (SN) ejecta, excited by the forward and reverse shocks respectively.
