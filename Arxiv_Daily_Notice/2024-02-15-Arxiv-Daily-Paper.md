 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming NASA SPHEREx (Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer) all-sky 0.7 to 5.0 um spectral survey, to be conducted from 2025 to 2027, provides a unique space-based opportunity to detect, spectrally categorize, and catalog hundreds of thousands of solar system objects at WISE/NEOWISE sensitivities. This paper discusses the unique near-infrared capabilities of SPHEREx, its potential applications in Planetary Defense, (PD), and the implications for risk mitigation associated with Potentially Hazardous Objects (PHOs). By leveraging SPHEREx data, scientists and decision-makers can enhance our ability to track and characterize PHOs, ultimately contributing to the protection of our planet.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasars at redshifts $z>6$ are an excellent probe of the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes in the early Universe. The population of radio-luminous quasars is of particular interest, as such quasars could potentially be used to study the neutral intergalactic medium during cosmic reionisation via H$\,$I 21$\,$cm absorption studies. However, the lack of deep radio observations of $z>6$ quasars leaves the population poorly constrained, and suitable candidates for an H$\,$I 21$\,$cm absorption study have yet to be found. In this work, we present Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) 1$-$2 GHz radio continuum observations of 138 quasars at redshifts $6.0 \leq z<7.6$. We detect the radio continuum emission of the $z=6.1$ quasar J1034-1425, with a 1.6 GHz flux density of $170\pm 36\,\mu$Jy. This quasar is radio-quiet with radio-loudness, $R \equiv f_{5\text{~GHz}}/f_{\nu,\text{4400 A}} = 2.4\pm0.5$. In addition, we detect 7 other quasars at z>6, which have previously been characterised in the literature at these frequencies. Using the full sample, we estimate the radio-loud fraction to be $3.8^{+6.2}_{-2.4}\%$, where the uncertainties are 95% confidence intervals. This is lower than recent estimates of the radio-loud fraction in the literature, but is still marginally consistent with no redshift evolution of the radio-loud fraction. We explore the undetected quasar population by stacking their continuum images at their optical positions and obtain a median stacked flux density of $13.8\pm 3.9~\mu$Jy and luminosity of $\log{L_{5~\mathrm{GHz}}/(\mathrm{W~Hz}^{-1})}=24.2\pm0.1$.

 - **Abstract**
 Reconstructions of the paleoclimate indicate that ancient climatic fluctuations on Earth are often correlated with variations in its orbital elements. However, the chaos inherent in the solar system's orbital evolution prevents numerical simulations from confidently predicting Earth's past orbital evolution beyond 50-100 Myrs. Gravitational interactions among the Sun's planets and asteroids are believed to set this limiting time horizon, but most prior works approximate the solar system as an isolated system and neglect our surrounding Galaxy. Here we present simulations that include the Sun's nearby stellar population, and we find that close-passing field stars alter our entire planetary system's orbital evolution via their gravitational perturbations on the giant planets. This shortens the timespan over which Earth's orbital evolution can be definitively known by a further ~10%. In particular, in simulations that include an exceptionally close passage of the Sun-like star HD 7977 2.8 Myrs ago, new sequences of Earth's orbital evolution become possible in epochs before ~50 Myrs ago, which includes the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. Thus, simulations predicting Earth's past orbital evolution before ~50 Myrs ago must consider the additional uncertainty from passing stars, which can open new regimes of past orbital evolution not seen in previous modeling efforts.
#### Astrophysical and relativistic modeling of the recoiling black-hole  candidate in quasar 3C 186

 - **Abstract**
 The compact object in quasar 3C 186 is one of the most promising recoiling black-hole candidates, exhibiting both an astrometric displacement between the quasar and the host galaxy as well as a spectroscopic shift between broad and narrow lines. 3C 186 also presents a radio jet which, when projected onto the plane of the sky, appears to be perpendicular to the quasar/galaxy displacement. Assuming a gravitational-wave kick is indeed responsible for the properties of 3C 186 and using state-of-the-art relativistic modeling, we show that current observations allow for exquisite modeling of the recoiling black hole. Most notably, we find that the kick velocity, the black-hole spin, and the line of sight are almost collinear and the former appear perpendicular to each other only because of a strong projection effect. The targeted configuration requires substantial fine-tuning: while there exists a region in the black-hole binary parameter space that is compatible with 3C 186, the observed system appears to be a rare occurrence. Using archival radio observations, we explore different strategies that could potentially confirm or rule out our interpretation. In particular, we develop two observational tests that rely on the brightness ratio between the approaching and receding jet as well as the asymmetry of the jet lobes. While the available radio data provide loose constraints, deeper observations have the unique potential of unveiling the nature of 3C 186.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of cosmic dark matter and neutrino properties are long-standing problems in cosmology and particle physics. These problems have been investigated by using radiation detectors. We will discuss the application of inorganic crystal scintillators to studies on dark matter and neutrino properties. A large volume and high-purity inorganic crystal is a promising detector for investigating dark matter and neutrino.
#### Noble Gas Planetology and the Xenon Clouds of Uranus

 - **Abstract**
 Noble gases provide tracers of cosmic provenance that are accessible to a future Uranus Atmospheric Probe. Argon and krypton are expected to be well-mixed on Uranus with respect to H$_2$ and He, although condensation at the winter pole may be possible. The Ar/H$_2$ and Ar/Kr ratios address whether the materials accreted by Uranus resembled the extremely cold materials accreted by Jupiter's atmosphere, or whether they were warmer like comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, or whether Uranus is like neither. Xenon condenses as an ice, probably on methane ice, in Uranus's upper troposphere. Condensation may complicate interpretation of Xe/H$_2$, but it also presents an opportunity to collect concentrated xenon samples suitable for measuring isotopes. Solar System Xe tracks three distinct nucleosynthetic xenon reservoirs, one evident in the Sun and in chondritic meteorites, a second in refractory presolar grains, and a third evident in comet 67P/C-G and in Earth's air. The first and third reservoirs appear to have been captured from different clouds of gas. The two gases do not appear to have been well-mixed; moreover, the high $^{129}$Xe/$^{132}$Xe ratio in 67P/C-G implies that the gas was captured before the initial nucleosynthetic complement of $^{129}$I (15.7 Myr half-life) had decayed. Xenon's isotopic peculiarities, if seen in Uranus, could usefully upset our understanding of planetary origins. Krypton's isotopic anomalies are more subtle and may prove hard to measure. There is a slight chance that neon and helium fractionations can be used to constrain how Uranus acquired its nebular envelope.
#### Interacting Scalar fields: Dark Matter--Early Dark Energy

 - **Abstract**
 The main aim of this work is to explore the possibility that cold dark matter (CDM) and early dark energy (EDE) can be described by canonical scalar fields that are coupled at the level of its conservation equations. The formalism covers dynamical aspects at the background and linear perturbation levels for an arbitrary coupling function, followed by an example of it. We emphasize the impact of this model on the Matter Power Spectrum and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectra, with or without direct interaction. Our findings indicate that the presence of a scalar field can partially counteract the known effects of the other, opening the possibility to avoid some undesired aspects, such as the increase in $\Omega_{m}$ that usually is needed in the case of a purely EDE scalar field scenario, in order to fit the CMB spectra. This opens up the possibility to analyzing whether the interaction can help to ameliorate the cosmological tensions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive catalog of 2824 RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) residing in 115 Galactic globular clusters (GCs). Our catalog includes 1594 fundamental-mode (RRab), 824 first-overtone (RRc), and 28 double-mode (RRd) RRLs, as well as 378 RRLs of an unknown pulsation mode. We cross-matched 481349 RRLs reported in the third data release (DR3) of the ESA mission Gaia and the literature to 170 known GCs. Membership probabilities were computed as the products of a position and shape-dependent prior and a likelihood was computed using parallaxes, proper motions, and, where available, radial velocities from Gaia. Membership likelihoods of RRLs were computed by comparing cluster average parameters based on known member stars and the cross-matched RRLs. We determined empirical RRL instability strip (IS) boundaries based on our catalog and detected three new cluster RRLs inside this region via their excess Gaia G-band photometric uncertainties. We find that 77% of RRLs in GCs are included in the Gaia DR3 Specific Object Study, and 82% were classified as RRLs by the Gaia DR3 classifier, with the majority of the missing sources being located at the crowded GC centers. Surprisingly, we find that 25% of cluster member stars located within the empirical IS are not RRLs and appear to be non-variable. Additionally, we find that 80% of RRab, 84% of RRc, and 100% of the RRd stars are located within theoretical IS boundaries predicted using MESA models with Z = 0.0003, M = 0.7 (M_\odot), and Y = 0.290. Unexpectedly, a higher Y = 0.357 is required to fully match the location of RRc stars, and lower Y = 0.220 is needed to match the location of RRab stars. Lastly, our catalog does not exhibit an Oosterhoff dichotomy, with at least 22 GCs located inside the Oosterhoff "gap," which is close to the mode of the distribution of mean RRL periods in GCs.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio emission from pulsars can be used to map out their distances through dispersion measure (DM), which quantifies the amount of radio pulse dispersion. However, this method relies on accurately modeling the free electron density in the line of sight. Here, we present a detailed study of the multi-wavelength emission from PSR J1720-0534, a black widow compact binary millisecond pulsar discovered in 2021, which the latest electron density model of the Galaxy (YMW16; Yao et al. 2017) places at only 191 pc. We obtained and analyzed deep multi-wavelength observations in the $\gamma$-ray (Fermi-LAT, 2008-2022), optical (LCO, 2.7-h), near-infrared (NOT, 3.5-h) and X-ray (Swift-XRT, 10 ksec) bands. We found no significant detection of $\gamma$-ray, optical, near-infrared, or X-ray counterparts around the radio-timing position of PSR J1720-0534, which we thus nickname 'the invisible black widow'. Employing the most constraining near-infrared limit ($J>23.4$ mag), we established a lower limit on the source distance, $d>1.1$ kpc, assuming conservative properties for the black widow companion star. This distance lower limit differs drastically (by a factor of more than five) from the YMW16 DM distance estimate. We attribute this difference to the inclusion in the YMW16 model of a large and dense component towards the North Polar Spur. Considering our results and recent parallax distances to other pulsars in this direction, we argue that such a local and large component in the electron density model of the Galaxy is unnecessary.
#### Asgard/NOTT: L-band nulling interferometry at the VLTI. II. Warm optical  design and injection system

 - **Abstract**
 Asgard/NOTT (previously Hi-5) is a European Research Council (ERC)-funded project hosted at KU Leuven and a new visitor instrument for the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). Its primary goal is to image the snow line region around young stars using nulling interferometry in the L-band (3.5 to 4.0)$\mu$m, where the contrast between exoplanets and their host stars is advantageous. The breakthrough is the use of a photonic beam combiner, which only recently allowed the required theoretical raw contrast of $10^{-3}$ in this spectral range. Nulling interferometry observations of exoplanets also require a high degree of balancing between the four pupils of the VLTI in terms of intensity, phase, and polarization. The injection into the beam combiner and the requirements of nulling interferometry are driving the design of the warm optics and the injection system. The optical design up to the beam combiner is presented. It offers a technical solution to efficiently couple the light from the VLTI into the beam combiner. During the coupling, the objective is to limit throughput losses to 5% of the best expected efficiency for the injection. To achieve this, a list of different loss sources is considered with their respective impact on the injection efficiency. Solutions are also proposed to meet the requirements on beam balancing for intensity, phase, and polarization. The different properties of the design are listed, including the optics used, their alignment and tolerances, and their impact on the instrumental performances in terms of throughput and null depth. The performance evaluation gives an expected throughput loss of less than <6.4% of the best efficiency for the injection and a null depth of $\sim2.10^{-3}$, mainly from optical path delay errors outside the scope of this work.

 - **Abstract**
 The age, evolution, and chemical properties of the Galactic disk can be effectively ascertained using open clusters. Within the large program Stellar Populations Astrophysics at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, we specifically focused on stars in open clusters, to investigate various astrophysical topics, from the chemical content of very young systems to the abundance patterns of lesser studied intermediate-age and old open clusters. We investigate the astrophysically interesting element fluorine (F), which has an uncertain and intriguing cosmic origin. We also determine the abundance of cerium (Ce), as F abundance is expected to correlate with the s-process elements. High-resolution near-infrared spectra were obtained using the GIANO-B spectrograph. The Python version of Spectroscopy Made Easy (PySME), was used to derive atmospheric parameters and abundances. The stellar parameters were determined using OH, CN, and CO molecular lines along with Fe I lines. This paper presents the first F Galactic radial abundance gradient. Our results are also compared with literature estimates and with Galactic chemical evolution models that have been generated using different F production channels. Our results indicate a constant, solar pattern in the [F/Fe] ratios across clusters of different ages, supporting the latest findings that fluorine levels do not exhibit any secondary behavior for stars with solar or above-solar metallicity. By comparing our sample stars with the predictions of Galactic chemical evolution models, we came to the conclusion that both asymptotic giant branch stars and massive stars, including a fraction of fast rotators that increase with decreasing metallicity, are needed to explain the cosmic origin of F.
#### High resolution optical spectra of the dormant LBV star P Cyg

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09061
 - **Abstract**
 High resolution optical spectra (R = 60 000) of the LBV star P Cyg beyond outburst were obtained on the 6-meter BTA telescope in the wavelength range 477-780 nm. We perform a detailed identification of different types lines (photospheric absorptions, permitted and forbidden emissions, components of lines with P Cyg type profiles), and studied the variability of their profiles and radial velocities. The average radial velocity from positions of forbidden emissions ([NII] 5754.64, [FeII] 5261.62, [FeII] 7155.14 and [NiII] 7377.83 \r{A}) is accepted as the system velocity Vsys=$-34\pm1.4$ km/s. About a dozen photospheric absorptions of CNO triad ions and SiIII are found, their stable position, Vr(abs)=$-73.8$ km/s, shifted relative to at $-40$ km/s, indicates that these absorbtions are formed in the pseudophotosphere region. The high-excitation emissions ([OI] 5577, 6300, 6363 \r{A}, [OIII] 4959 and 5007 \r{A}, as well as HeII 4686 \r{A}) are absent in the spectra. The radial velocity Vr(DIBs)=$-11.8$ km/s according to the position of numerous DIBs is consistent with the position of the interstellar components of the D-lines NaI and KI forming in the galactic Perseus arm. A color excess E(B-V)=0.34+/-0.03 mag and interstellar absorption Av=1.09 mag were determined by measurements of equivalent widths of nine DIBs.
#### Science Opportunities for IMAP-Lo Observations of Interstellar Neutral  Hydrogen and Deuterium During a Maximum of Solar Activity

 - **Abstract**
 Direct-sampling observations of interstellar neutral gas, including hydrogen and deuterium, have been performed for more than one cycle of solar activity by IBEX. IBEX viewing is restricted to directions perpendicular to the spacecraft--Sun line, which limits the observations to several months each year. This restriction is removed in a forthcoming mission Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe. The IMAP-Lo instrument will have a capability of adjusting the angle of its boresight with the spacecraft rotation axis. We continue a series of studies of resulting science opportunities. We adopt a schedule of adjusting the boresight angle suggested by Kubiak et al. 2023 and focus on interstellar hydrogen and deuterium during solar maximum epoch. Based on extensive set of simulations, we identify the times during calendar year and elongation angles of the boresight needed to measure the abundance of D/H at the termination shock and unambiguously observe interstellar H without contribution from interstellar He. Furthermore, IMAP-Lo will be able to resolve the primary and secondary populations, in particular to view the secondary population with little contribution from the primary. We show that the expected signal is sensitive to details of radiation pressure, particularly its dependence on radial speed of the atoms, and to details of the behavior of the distribution function of the primary and secondary populations at the heliopause. Therefore, IMAP-Lo will be able to provide observations needed to address compelling questions of the heliospheric physics, and even general astrophysics.
#### Vapor equilibrium models of accreting rocky planets demonstrate direct  core growth by pebble accretion

 - **Abstract**
 The gaseous envelope of an accreting rocky planet becomes hot enough to sublimate silicates and other refractory minerals. % aims heading (mandatory) For this work, we studied the effect of the resulting envelope enrichment with a heavy vapor species on the composition and temperature of the envelope. For simplification, we used the gas-phase molecule SiO to represent the sublimation of silicate material. We solved the equilibrium structure equations in 1D for planets in the mass range of $0.1$ to $3\,M_\oplus$. The convective stability criterion was extended to take the stabilizing effect of the condensation of SiO clouds into account. We assumed that the envelope is both in hydrostatic equilibrium and in vapor equilibrium with the underlying magma ocean. This means that pebbles do not undergo sublimation in the envelope and therefore survive until they plunge into the magma ocean. We find that the emergence of an inner radiative region, where SiO condensation suppresses convection, increases the pressure and temperature in the inner envelope compared to pure H$_2$/He envelopes once $M_\mathrm{pl} \gtrsim 0.3\,M_\oplus$. For $M_\mathrm{pl}>0.75\,M_\oplus$, the temperature and pressure close to the surface reach the supercritical point of SiO. The amount of SiO stored in the envelope is lower than the total planet mass for low mass planets. However, for $M_\mathrm{pl}>2.0\,M_\oplus$, all accreted pebble material must contribute to maintain the vapor equilibrium in the envelope. Therefore, the non-vapor mass of the planet ceases to increase beyond this threshold. Overall, our vapor equilibrium model of the planetary envelope allows for direct core growth by pebble accretion up to much higher masses than previously thought.

 - **Abstract**
 A six-night optical turbulence monitoring campaign has been carried at Cerro Paranal observatory in February and March, 2023 to facilitate the development and characterisation of two novel atmospheric site monitoring instruments - the ring-image next generation scintillation sensor (RINGSS) and 24-hour Shack Hartmann image motion monitor (24hSHIMM) in the context of providing optical turbulence monitoring support for upcoming 20-40m telescopes. Alongside these two instruments, the well-characterised Stereo-SCIDAR and 2016-MASS-DIMM were operated throughout the campaign to provide data for comparison. All instruments obtain estimates of optical turbulence profiles through statistical analysis of intensity and wavefront angle-of-arrival fluctuations from observations of stars. Contemporaneous measurements of the integrated turbulence parameters are compared and the ratios, bias, unbiased root mean square error and correlation of results from each instrument assessed. Strong agreement was observed in measurements of seeing, free atmosphere seeing and coherence time. Less correlation is seen for isoplanatic angle, although the median values agree well. Median turbulence parameters are further compared against long-term monitoring data from Paranal instruments. Profiles from the three small-telescope instruments are compared with the 100-layer profile from the stereo-SCIDAR. It is found that the RINGSS and SHIMM offer improved accuracy in characterisation of the vertical optical turbulence profile over the MASS-DIMM. Finally, the first results of continuous optical turbulence monitoring at Paranal are presented which show a strong diurnal variation and predictable trend in the seeing. A value of 2.65" is found for the median daytime seeing.

 - **Abstract**
 The McNish and Lincoln (ML) method, introduced in 1949, was one of the first attempts to produce mid-term forecasts of solar activity, up to 12 months ahead. However, it has been poorly described and evaluated in the past literature, in particular its actual operational implementation by NOAA. Here, we reconstruct the exact formulation of the method, as it was applied since the early 1970s, and we provide a full mathematical derivation of the prediction errors. For bench-marking the method, we also produce monthly predictions over the past 190 years, from 1833 (Cycle 8) to 2023 (Cycle 25), and develop statistics of the differences between the predictions and the observed 13-month smoothed sunspot number (SSN) time series, according to the phase in the solar cycle. Our analysis shows that the ML method is heavily constrained because it is primarily based on the mean of all past cycles, which imposes a fixed amplitude and length and suffers from a temporal smearing that grows towards the end of the solar cycle. We find that predictions are completely unreliable in the first 12 months of the cycle, and over the last two years preceding the ending minimum (around 130 months), and beyond this minimum. By contrast, in the course of the cycle (months 18 to 65), ML predictions prove to be reliable over a time range of up to 50 months (4.2 years), thus much longer than the 12-month conventional range used so far. However, we find that predictions then suffer from systematic under-(over-)estimates for cycles that have a higher (lower) amplitude than the base mean cycle. Overall, we conclude that although the ML method provides valid prediction errors, it suffers from strong limitations, with very little room for improvement, as it indifferently merges all past cycles into a single fixed statistics.
#### Neutrino flavor transformation with moments: application to fast flavor  instabilities in neutron star mergers

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino evolution, of great importance in environments such as neutron star mergers (NSMs) because of their impact on explosive nucleosynthesis, is still poorly understood due to the high complexity and variety of possible flavor conversion mechanisms. In this study, we focus on so-called "fast flavor oscillations", which can occur on timescales of nanoseconds and are connected to the existence of a crossing between the angular distributions of electron (anti)neutrinos. Based on the neutrino radiation field drawn from a three dimensional neutron star merger simulation, we use an extension of the two-moment formalism of neutrino quantum kinetics, and perform a linear stability analysis to determine the characteristics of fast flavor instabilities across the simulation. We compare the results to local (centimeter-scale) three-dimensional two-flavor simulations using either a moment method or a particle-in-cell architecture. We get generally good agreement in the instability growth rate and typical instability lengthscale, although the imperfections of the closure used in moment methods remain to be better understood.

 Aims. We explore different scenarios to explain the chemical difference found in the remarkable giant-giant binary system HD 138202 + CD-30 12303. For the first time, we suggest how to distinguish these scenarios by taking advantage of the extensive convective envelopes of giant stars. Methods. We carried out a high-precision determination of stellar parameters and abundances by applying a full line-by-line differential analysis on GHOST high-resolution spectra. Results. We found a significant chemical difference between the two stars (0.08 dex), which is largely unexpected considering the insensitivity of giant stars to planetary ingestion and diffusion effects. We tested the possibility of engulfment events by using several different combinations of stellar mass, ingested mass, metallicity of the engulfed object and different convective envelopes. However, the planetary ingestion scenario does not seem to explain the observed differences. For the first time, we distinguished the source of chemical differences using a giant-giant binary system. By ruling out other possible scenarios such as planet formation and evolutionary effects between the two stars, we suggest that primordial inhomogeneities might explain the observed differences. This remarkable result implies that the metallicity differences that were observed in at least some main-sequence binary systems might be related to primordial inhomogeneities rather than engulfment events. We also discuss the important implications of finding primordial inhomogeneities, which affect chemical tagging and other fields such as planet formation. We strongly encourage the use of giant-giant pairs. They are a relevant complement to main-sequence pairs for determining the origin of the observed chemical differences in multiple systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the first-order phase transition catalyzed by primordial black holes~(PBHs) in the early Universe. We find that super-horizon curvature perturbations generated in this scenario lead to the production of gravitational waves when the scalar modes re-enter the horizon. If PBHs with masses about $10^{-13}M_{\odot}$ constitute all dark matter, the first-order electroweak phase transition catalyzed by PBHs can explain the gravitational wave signal observed by pulsar timing array collaborations without the overproduction of PBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-short period planets have orbital periods of less than one day. Since their masses and radii can be determined to a higher precision than long-period planets, they are the preferred targets to determine the density of planets which constrains their composition. The K2-106 system is particularly interesting because it contains two planets of nearly identical masses. One is a high density USP, the other is a low-density planet that has an orbital period of 13 days. Combining the Gaia DR3 results with new ESPRESSO data allows us to determine the masses and radii of the two planets more precisely than before. We find that the USP K2-106b has a density consistent with an Earth-like composition, and K2-106c is a low-density planet that presumably has an extended atmosphere. We measure a radius of Rp=1.676-0.037+0.037 REarth, a mass of Mp=7.80-0.70+0.71 MEarth and a density of rho=9.09-0.98+0.98 gcm-3 for K2-106b. For K2-106c, we derive Rp=2.84-0.08+0.10 REarth, Mp=7.3-2.4+2.5 MEarth, and a density of rho= 1.72-0.58+0.66 gcm-3. We finally discuss the possible structures of the two planets with respect to other low-mass planets.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical evolution of protoplanetary discs is not fully understood, several factors influence the final distribution of disc material. One such factor are inward drifting and evaporating pebbles that enrich the inner disc with vapour. In particular, it is first enriched with water vapour, resulting in a low C/O ratio, before carbon-rich gas from the outer disc is transported inwards elevating the C/O ratio again. However, it is unclear how internal photoevaporation, which carries away gas and opens gaps that block inward drifting pebbles, affects the chemical composition of the disc. We aim to study these effects in discs around solar-like stars, where we especially focus on the C/O ratio and the water content. The simulations are carried out using a semi-analytical 1D disc model. Our code chemcomp includes viscous evolution and heating, pebble growth and drift, pebble evaporation and condensation, and a simple chemical partitioning model. We show that internal photoevaporation plays a major role in the (chemical) evolution of protoplanetary discs: As it opens a gap, inward drifting pebbles are stopped and cannot contribute to the volatile content any more. In addition, gas from the outer disc is carried away by photoevaporative winds. Consequently, the C/O ratio in the inner disc is low. In contrast, gaps opened by giant planets allow the gas to pass, resulting in an elevated C/O ratio, similar to viscous discs without internal photoevaporation. This will enable us to distinguish observationally between these two scenarios when measuring the C/O ratio, implying that we can infer the cause of gap structures in disc observations. In the case of a photoevaporative disc, we additionally find an elevated water content in the inner disc as the water vapour and ice undergo a cycle of evaporation/re-condensation, preventing its inward accretion onto the star.

 - **Abstract**
 We have searched for radio pulsations towards 49 Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) 1FGL Catalog $\gamma$-ray sources using the Green Bank Telescope at 350 MHz. We detected 18 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in blind searches of the data; 10 of these were discoveries unique to our survey. Sixteen are binaries, with eight having short orbital periods $P_B < 1$ day. No radio pulsations from young pulsars were detected, although three targets are coincident with apparently radio-quiet $\gamma$-ray pulsars discovered in LAT data. Here, we give an overview of the survey and present radio and $\gamma$-ray timing results for the 10 MSPs discovered. These include the only isolated MSP discovered in our survey and six short-$P_B$ binary MSPs. Of these, three have very low-mass companions ($M_c$ $\ll$ 0.1M$_{\odot}$) and hence belong to the class of black widow pulsars. Two have more massive, non-degenerate companions with extensive radio eclipses and orbitally modulated X-ray emission consistent with the redback class. Significant $\gamma$-ray pulsations have been detected from nine of the discoveries. This survey and similar efforts suggest that the majority of Galactic $\gamma$-ray sources at high Galactic latitudes are either MSPs or relatively nearby non-recycled pulsars, with the latter having on average a much smaller radio/$\gamma$-ray beaming ratio as compared to MSPs. It also confirms that past surveys suffered from an observational bias against finding short-$P_B$ MSP systems.
#### Effects of physical conditions on the stellar initial mass function: The  low-metallicity star-forming region Sh 2-209

 - **Abstract**
 Recent work suggested that the variation of the initial mass function (IMF) of stars depends on the physical conditions, notably, the metallicity and gas density. We investigated the properties of two clusters, namely the main cluster (MC) and the subcluster (SC), in the low-metallicity HII region Sh 2-209 (S209) based on recently derived IMFs. We tested three previously published correlations using previous observations: the top-heaviness of the IMF in dependence on metallicity, the half-mass radius, and the most massive star in dependence on the stellar mass of the embedded clusters. For this region, two different galactocentric distances, namely 10.5 kpc and 18 kpc, were considered, where an age-distance-degeneracy was found for the previously determined IMF to be consistent with other formulated metallicity and density dependent IMFs. The determined half-mass radius (0.080 +/- 0.005) pc and the embedded cluster density (0.2 +/- 0.1) 10^6 Msun pc^-3 for the MC with an age of 0.5 Myr in S209 assuming a galactocentric distance of 18 kpc support the assumption that a low-metallicity environment results in a denser cluster, which leads to a top-heavy IMF. Thus, all three tests are consistent with the previously published correlations. The results for S209 are placed in the context with the IMF determination within the metal-poor cluster in the star-forming region NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud.
