 - **Abstract**
 The community agrees that Type Ia supernovae arise from Carbon/Oxygen white dwarfs undergoing thermonuclear runaway. However, the full progenitor system and the process that prompts the white dwarf to explode remain unknown. Most current models suggest that the white dwarf explodes because of interaction with a binary companion which may survive the process and remain within the resulting remnant of the exploded star. Furthermore, both the pre-supernova interaction process and the explosion of the primary are expected to imprint a significant departure from ordinary stellar radii and temperatures onto the secondary, making the star identifiable against the unrelated stellar population. Identification of a surviving companion inside an SN Ia remnant might confirm a specific corresponding SN Ia progenitor channel based on the identity of the companion. We conducted a surviving companion search of the Type Ia remnant SNR 0509-67.5 based in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The well-constrained distance to and foreground extinction of the Large Magellanic Cloud allow for Bayesian inference of stellar parameters with low correlation and uncertainties. We present a deep catalog of fully characterized stars interior to SNR 0509-67.5 with radii, effective temperatures, and metallicities inferred using combined Hubble Space Telescope photometric observations across multiple visits. We then compile a list of surviving companion models appropriate for the age of the remnant (roughly 400 years after the explosion). We compare these predictions with the inferred stellar parameters and conclude that none of the stars are consistent with the predicted signatures of a surviving companion.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-cadence ultraviolet through near-infrared observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2023bee in NGC~2708 ($D = 32 \pm 3$ Mpc), finding excess flux in the first days after explosion relative to the expected power-law rise from an expanding fireball. This deviation from typical behavior for SNe Ia is particularly obvious in our 10-minute cadence $TESS$ light curve and $Swift$ UV data. Compared to a few other normal SNe Ia with detected early excess flux, the excess flux in SN 2023bee is redder in the UV and less luminous. We present optical spectra of SN 2023bee, including two spectra during the period where the flux excess is dominant. At this time, the spectra are similar to those of other SNe Ia but with weaker Si II, C II and Ca II absorption lines, perhaps because the excess flux creates a stronger continuum. We compare the data to several theoretical models that have been proposed to explain the early flux excess in SNe Ia. Interaction with either a nearby companion star or close-in circumstellar material is expected to produce a faster evolution than seen in the data. Radioactive material in the outer layers of the ejecta, either from a double detonation explosion or simply an explosion with a $^{56}$Ni clump near the surface, can not fully reproduce the evolution either, likely due to the sensitivity of early UV observable to the treatment of the outer part of ejecta in simulation. We conclude that no current model can adequately explain the full set of observations. We find that a relatively large fraction of nearby, bright SNe Ia with high-cadence observations have some amount of excess flux within a few days of explosion. Considering potential asymmetric emission, the physical cause of this excess flux may be ubiquitous in normal SNe Ia.

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary debris disks around other stars are analogous to the Asteroid and Kuiper belts in the Solar System. Their structure reveals the configuration of small bodies and provides hints for the presence of planets. The nearby star Fomalhaut hosts one of the most prominent debris disks, resolved by HST, Spitzer, Herschel, and ALMA. Images of this system at mid-infrared wavelengths using JWST/MIRI not only show the narrow Kuiper-Belt-analog outer ring, but also that (1) what was thought from indirect evidence to be an asteroid-analog structure is instead broad, extending outward into the outer system; (2) there is an intermediate belt, probably shepherded by an unseen planet. The newly discovered belt is demarcated by an inner gap, located at ~ 78 au, and it is misaligned relative to the outer belt. The previously known collisionally generated dust cloud, Fomalhaut b, could have originated from this belt, suggesting increased dynamical stirring and collision rates there. We also discovered a large dust cloud within the outer ring, possible evidence of another dust-creating collision. Taken together with previous observations, Fomalhaut appears to be the site of a complex and possibly dynamically active planetary system.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio-loud active galactic nuclei (RLAGNs) are rare among AGN populations. Lacking high-resolution and high-frequency observations, their structure and evolution stages are not well understood at high redshifts. In this work, we report ALMA 237 GHz continuum observation at $0.023''$ resolution and VLA 44 GHz continuum observation at $0.08''$ resolution of the radio continuum emission from a high-redshift radio and hyper-luminous infrared galaxy at $z=1.92$. The new observations confirm the South-East (SE) and North-West (NW) hotspots identified by previous low-resolution VLA observations at 4.7 and 8.2 GHz and identify a radio core undetected in all previous observations. The SE hotspot has a higher flux density than the NW one does by a factor of 6, suggesting that there can be a Doppler boosting effect in the SE one. In this scenario, we estimate the advance speed of the jet head, ranging from $\sim$0.1c -- 0.3c, which yields a mildly relativistic case. The projected linear distance between the two hotspots is $\sim13$ kpc, yielding a linear size ($\leq20$ kpc) of a Compact-Steep-Spectrum (CSS) source. Combined with new \black{high-frequency ($\nu_\text{obs}\geq44$ GHz) and archived low-frequency observations ($\nu_\text{obs}\leq8.2$ GHz)}, we find that injection spectra of both NW and SE hotspots can be fitted with a continuous injection (CI) model. Based on the CI model, the synchrotron ages of NW and SE hotspots have an order of $10^5$ yr, consistent with the order of magnitude $10^3 - 10^5$ yr observed in CSS sources associated with radio AGNs at an early evolution stage. The CI model also favors the scenario in which the double hotspots have experienced a quiescent phase, suggesting that this RLAGN may have transient or intermittent activities.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical events that occur in active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks are believed to differ significantly from the ordinary in the interstellar medium. We show that stars located in the outer region of the AGN disk would explode near the original migration starting points instead of being accreted by the central supermassive black hole due to the effect of viscosity. AGN disks provide a dense environment for supernova (SN) explosions, which inevitably involve ejecta-disk interactions. In this paper, we investigate the light curves (LCs) of core-collapse SN exploded in AGN disks. In addition to the fundamental energy source of $^{56} \mathrm{Ni}$--$^{56} \mathrm{Co}$--$^{56} \mathrm{Fe}$ decay reaction powering the SN LCs, the forward-reverse shock produced during interactions may contribute significantly to the observed flux. If the stellar winds manage to create a cavity surrounded by a shell near the star before the SN explosion, the ejecta-winds-disk configurations are expected. We present various SN LCs from different types of progenitors and find that the SN LCs are dominated by the radiation of ejecta-disk interaction-induced shocks. The resulting SNe in the AGN disk is a promising transient source for UV and optical band detection by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift), the Ultraviolet Explorer (UVEX) and wide field survey telescopes such as Ultraviolet Transient Astronomy Satellite (ULTRASAT), Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) and Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. These detections could aid in the investigation of AGN discs and the associated high-energy transient occurrences.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolutionary sequence for high-mass star formation starts with massive starless clumps that go on to form protostellar, young stellar objects and then compact HII regions. While there are many examples of the three later stages, the very early stages have proved to be elusive. We follow-up a sample of 110 mid-infrared dark clumps selected from the ATLASGAL catalogue with the IRAM telescope in an effort to identify a robust sample of massive starless clumps. We have used the HCO+ (1-0) and HNC (1-0) transitions to identify clumps associated with infall motion and the SiO (2-1) transition to identity outflow candidates. We have found blue asymmetric line profile in 65% of the sample, and have measured the infall velocities and mass infall rates (0.6-$36 \times 10^{-3}$ Msun/yr) for 33 of these clumps. We find a trend for the mass infall rate decreasing with an increase of bolometric luminosity to clump mass i.e. star formation within the clumps evolves. Using the SiO 2-1 line, we have identified good outflow candidates. Combining the infall and outflow tracers reveals that 67% of quiescent clumps are already undergoing gravitational collapse or are associated with star formation; these clumps provide us with our best opportunity to determined the initial conditions and study the earliest stages of massive star formation. Finally, we provide an overview of a systematic high-resolution ALMA study of quiescent clumps selected that allows us to develop a detailed understanding of earliest stages and their subsequent evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyzed the 3-mm wavelength spectral line survey of 408 ATLASGAL clumps observed with the IRAM 30m-telescope, focusing on the class I methanol masers with frequencies near 84, 95 and 104.3 GHz. We detect narrow, maser-like features towards 54, 100 and 4 sources in the maser lines near 84, 95 and 104.3 GHz, respectively. Among them, fifty 84 GHz masers, twenty nine 95 GHz masers and four rare 104.3 GHz masers are new discoveries. The new detections increase the number of known 104.3 GHz masers from 5 to 9. The 95 GHz class I methanol maser is generally stronger than the 84 GHz maser counterpart. We find 9 sources showing class I methanol masers but no SiO emission, indicating that class I methanol masers might be the only signpost of protostellar outflow activity in extremely embedded objects at the earliest evolutionary stage. Class I methanol masers that are associated with sources that show SiO line wings are more numerous and stronger than those without such wings. The total integrated intensity of class I methanol masers is well correlated with the integrated intensity and velocity coverage of the SiO (2--1) emission. The properties of class I methanol masers are positively correlated with the bolometric luminosity, clump mass, peak H$_2$ column density of their associated clumps but uncorrelated with the luminosity-to-mass ratio, dust temperature, and mean H$_2$ volume density. We suggest that the properties of class I masers are related to shocks traced by SiO. Based on our observations, we conclude that class I methanol masers at 84 and 95 GHz can trace a similar evolutionary stage as H$_2$O maser, and appear prior to 6.7 and 12.2 GHz methanol and OH masers. Despite their small number, the 104.3 GHz class I masers appear to trace a short and more evolved stage compared to the other class I masers. [abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 Open clusters (OCs) are infrequent survivors of embedded clusters gestated in molecular clouds. Up to now, little is known about the initial conditions for the formation of OCs. Here, we studied this issue using high-precision astrometric parameters provided by Gaia data release 3. The statistics show that the peculiar motion velocities of OCs vary little from infancy to old age, providing a remarkable opportunity to use OCs to trace their progenitors. Adopting a dynamical method, we derived the masses of the progenitor clumps where OCs were born, which have statistical characteristics comparable to previously known results for clumps observed in the Galaxy. Moreover, the masses of the progenitor clumps of OCs indicate they should be capable of gestating massive O-type stars. In fact, after inspecting the observed OCs and O-type stars, we found that there are many O-type stars in OCs. The destructive stellar feedback from O-type stars may disintegrate the vast majority of embedded clusters, and only those sufficiently dense ones can survive as OCs.

 - **Abstract**
 The coupled, time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii and Ginzburg-Landau equations are solved simultaneously in three dimensions to investigate the equilibrium state and far-from-equilibrium, spin-down dynamics of an interpenetrating neutron superfluid and proton type-II superconductor, as an idealized description of the outer core of a neutron star. The simulations generalize previous calculations without the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation, where proton feedback is absent. If the angle $\theta$ between the rotation and magnetic axes does not equal zero, the equilibrium state consists of geometrically complicated neutron vortex and proton flux-tube tangles, as the topological defects pin to one another locally but align with different axes globally. During spin-down, new types of motion are observed. For $\theta = 0$, entire vortices pair rectilinearly with flux tubes and move together while pinned. For $\theta \neq 0$, vortex segments pair with segments from one or more flux tubes, and the paired segments move together while pinned. The degree to which proton feedback impedes the deceleration of the crust is evaluated as a function of $\theta$ and the pinning strength, $\eta$. Key geometric properties of vortex-flux-tube tangles, such as filament length, mean curvature, and polarity are analysed. It is found that proton feedback smooths the deceleration of the crust, reduces the rotational glitch sizes, and stabilizes the vortex tangle dynamics. The dimensionless control parameters in the simulations are mutually ordered to match what is expected in a real neutron star, but their central values and dynamics ranges differ from reality by many orders of magnitude due to computational limitations.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cassiopeia A supernova remnant has a complex structure, manifesting the multidimensional nature of core-collapse supernova explosions. To further understand this, we carried out near-infrared multi-object spectroscopy on the ejecta knots located in the "northeastern (NE) jet" and the "Fe K plume" regions, which are two distinct features in the outer eastern area of the remnant. Our study reveals that the knots exhibit varying ratios of [S II] 1.03 $\mu$m, [P II] 1.189 $\mu$m, and [Fe II] 1.257 $\mu$m lines depending on their locations within the remnant, suggesting regional differences in elemental composition. Notably, the knots in the NE jet are mostly 'S-rich' with weak or no [P II] lines, implying that they originated below the explosive Ne burning layer, consistent with the results of previous studies. We detected no ejecta knots exhibiting only [Fe II] lines in the NE jet area that are expected in the jet-driven SN explosion model. Instead, we discovered a dozen 'Fe-rich' knots in the Fe K plume area. We propose that they are dense knots produced by a complete Si burning with $\alpha$-rich freezeout in the innermost region of the progenitor and ejected with the diffuse X-ray emitting Fe ejecta but decoupled after crossing the reverse shock. In addition to these metal-rich ejecta knots, several knots emitting only He I 1.083 $\mu$m lines were detected, and their origin remains unclear. We also detected three extended H emission features of circumstellar or interstellar origin in this area and discuss its association with the supernova remnant.

 - **Abstract**
 The Interstellar Neutral Helium (ISN He) is an important source of information on the physical state of the Local Interstellar Medium. Radiation pressure acting on the neutral helium atoms in the heliosphere has always been neglected, its effect has been considered insignificant compared to gravitational force. The most advanced numerical models of ISN He take into account more and more subtle effects, therefore it is important to check if the effect of radiation pressure is still negligible. In this paper, we use the most up-to-date version of the Warsaw Test Particle Model (WTPM) to calculate the expected helium distribution in the heliosphere, and simulate the flux of ISN He observed by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and in the future by the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP). We compare results calculated with and without radiation pressure during low and high solar activity. The results show that in the analysis of IBEX-Lo observations the radiation pressure acting on typical helium causes flux differences at a level of 1-4% and is comparable to the observational errors. For the more sensitive IMAP-Lo instrument, there are some regions in the considered observations configurations where radiation pressure causes potentially statistically significant changes in the calculated fluxes. The effect can be up to 9% for the indirect beam and is likely to be higher than the estimated errors. Therefore, we claim that in the future analysis of the IMAP-Lo observations radiation pressure acting on ISN He should be considered.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct a catalogue of stellar masses and ages for 696,680 red giant branch (RGB) stars, 180,436 primary red clump (RC) stars, and 120,907 secondary RC stars selected from the LAMOST\,DR8. The RGBs, primary RCs, and secondary RCs are identified with the large frequency spacing ($\Delta \nu$) and period spacing ($\Delta P$), estimated from the LAMOST spectra with spectral SNRs $> 10$ by the neural network method supervised with the seismologic information from LAMOST-Kepler sample stars. The purity and completeness of both RGB and RC samples are better than 95\% and 90\%, respectively. The mass and age of RGBs and RCs are determined again with the neural network method by taking the LAMOST-Kepler giant stars as the training set. The typical uncertainties of stellar mass and age are, respectively, 10\% and 30\% for the RGB stellar sample. For RCs, the typical uncertainties of stellar mass and age are 9\% and 24\%, respectively. The RGB and RC stellar samples cover a large volume of the Milky Way (5 $< R < 20$\,kpc and $|Z| <$\,5\,kpc), which are valuable data sets for various Galactic studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Evidence of efficient acceleration of cosmic rays in massive young stellar objects has been recently reported. Among these massive protostars, S255 NIRS 3 for which extreme flaring events associated with radio jets have been detected, is one of the best objects to test this hypothesis. We search for gamma-ray emission associated with this object in Fermi-LAT data and inspect the gas content in different molecular lines using the MWISP survey. A GeV source dubbed 4FGL J0613.1+1749c lies on top of the MYSO region, where two filamentary ~10 pc CO structures extend along the same direction of the sub-parsec radio jets. We investigate the spectrum, morphology, and light curve of the gamma-ray source and compare it with the theoretical emission expected from hadronic and leptonic populations accelerated in the radio jets. We argue that the gamma-ray source could be powered by particles accelerated in the S255 NIRS 3 jets, radiating via Bremsstrahlung or proton-proton interaction, and with a synchrotron component shinning in radio from primary or secondary electrons in the case of a leptonic or hadronic population.
#### First evidence of multi-iron sub-populations in the Bulge Fossil  Fragment candidate Liller 1

 - **Abstract**
 In the context of a project aimed at characterizing the properties of the so-called Bulge Fossil Fragments (the fossil remnants of the bulge formation epoch), here we present the first determination of the metallicity distribution of Liller 1. For a sample of 64 individual member stars we used ESO- MUSE spectra to measure the equivalent width of the CaII triplet and then derive the iron abundance. To test the validity of the adopted calibration in the metal-rich regime, the procedure was first applied to three reference bulge globular clusters (NGC 6569, NGC 6440, and NGC 6528). In all the three cases, we found single-component iron distributions, with abundance values fully in agreement with those reported in the literature. The application of the same methodology to Liller 1 yielded, instead, a clear bimodal iron distribution, with a sub-solar component at $\text{[Fe/H]}= -0.48\,$dex ($\sigma = 0.22$) and a super-solar component at $\text{[Fe/H]}= +0.26\,$dex ($\sigma = 0.17$). The latter is found to be significantly more centrally concentrated than the metal-poor population, as expected in a self-enrichment scenario and in agreement with what found in another bulge system, Terzan 5. The obtained metallicity distribution is astonishingly similar to that predicted by the reconstructed star formation history of Liller 1, which is characterized by three main bursts and a low, but constant, activity of star formation over the entire lifetime. These findings provide further support to the possibility that, similar to Terzan 5, also Liller 1 is a Bulge Fossil Fragment.

 - **Abstract**
 The ${\rm H_2NC}$ radical is the high-energy metastable isomer of ${\rm H_2CN}$ radical, which has been recently detected for the first time in the interstellar medium towards a handful of cold galactic sources, besides a warm galaxy in front of the PKS 1830-211 quasar. These detections have shown that the ${\rm H_2CN}$/${\rm H_2NC}$ isomeric ratio, likewise the HCN/HNC ratio, might increase with the kinetic temperature ($T_{\rm kin}$), but the shortage of them in warm sources still prevents us to confirm this hypothesis and shed light about their chemistry. In this work, we present the first detection of ${\rm H_2CN}$ and ${\rm H_2NC}$ towards a warm galactic source, the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud (with $T_{\rm kin} > 70 \, {\rm K}$), using IRAM 30m observations. We have detected multiple hyperfine components of the $N_{K_\text{a}K_\text{c}} = 1_{01} - 0_{00}$ and $2_{02} - 1_{01}$ transitions. We derived molecular abundances with respect to ${\rm H_2}$ of (6.8$\pm$1.3)$\times 10^{-11}$ for ${\rm H_2CN}$ and of (3.1$\pm$0.7)$\times 10^{-11}$ for ${\rm H_2NC}$, and a ${\rm H_2CN}$/${\rm H_2NC}$ abundance ratio of 2.2$\pm$0.5. These detections confirm that the ${\rm H_2CN}$/${\rm H_2NC}$ ratio is $\gtrsim$2 for sources with $T_{\rm kin} > 70 \, {\rm K}$, larger than the $\sim$1 ratios previously found in colder cores ($T_{\rm kin}\sim10 \, {\rm K}$). This isomeric ratio dependence with temperature cannot be fully explained with the currently proposed gas-phase formation and destruction pathways. Grain surface reactions, including the ${\rm H_2NC} \rightarrow {\rm H_2CN}$ isomerization, deserve consideration to explain the higher isomeric ratios and ${\rm H_2CN}$ abundances observed in warm sources, where the molecules can be desorbed into the gas phase through thermal and/or shock-induced mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Short-lived radionuclides, such as 26Al and 60Fe, are tracers of star formation. Therefore, their abundances can unravel the recent star formation history of the host galaxy. In view of future gamma-ray surveys, we predict the masses and fluxes of these two elements in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using new chemical evolution models. Our best model reproduces the abundance patterns of alpha/Fe ratios, the gas mass, the average metallicity, the present time supernova and nova rates observed in LMC. We show three main results: i) the best model for the LMC suggests a star formation rate very mild at the beginning with a recent burst, and a Salpeter-like initial mass function. ii) The predicted mass of 26Al is 0.33 M_Sun, 2/3 produced by massive stars and 1/3 by novae. iii) The predicted mass of 60Fe is 0.44 M_Sun, entirely produced by massive stars. This result suggests a larger fraction of 60Fe, at variance with the Milky Way. The explanation for this lies in the adopted initial mass function, that for the LMC contains more massive stars than for the Milky Way. These predictions can be useful for the COSI-SMEX mission planned for launch in 2027. The expected gamma-ray line fluxes for the 1.809 MeV line of 26Al and the 1.173 and 1.332 MeV lines of 60Fe are in the range of (0.2-2.7)x10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1 and (0.7-2.8)x10^-7 ph cm^-2 s^-1, respectively. This new instrument could have the sensitivity to detect the upper end of the predicted 1.8 MeV flux within its nominal two-year mission.

 - **Abstract**
 Small planets located at the lower mode of the bimodal radius distribution are generally assumed to be composed of iron and silicates in a proportion similar to that of the Earth. However, recent discoveries are revealing a new group of low-density planets that are inconsistent with that description. We intend to confirm and characterize the TESS planet candidate TOI-244.01, which orbits the bright ($K$ = 7.97 mag), nearby ($d$ = 22 pc), and early-type (M2.5 V) M-dwarf star GJ 1018 with an orbital period of 7.4 days. We used Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to model 57 precise radial velocity measurements acquired by the ESPRESSO spectrograph together with TESS photometry and complementary HARPS data. We find TOI-244 b to be a super-Earth with a radius of $R_{\rm p}$ = 1.52 $\pm$ 0.12 $\rm R_{\oplus}$ and a mass of $M_{\rm p}$ = 2.68 $\pm$ 0.30 $\rm M_{\oplus}$. These values correspond to a density of $\rho$ = 4.2 $\pm$ 1.1 $\rm g \cdot cm^{-3}$, which is below what would be expected for an Earth-like composition. We find that atmospheric loss processes may have been efficient to remove a potential primordial hydrogen envelope, but high mean molecular weight volatiles such as water could have been retained. Our internal structure modeling suggests that TOI-244 b has a $479^{+128}_{-96}$ km thick hydrosphere over a 1.17 $\pm$ 0.09 $\rm R_{\oplus}$ solid structure composed of a Fe-rich core and a silicate-dominated mantle compatible with that of the Earth. On a population level, we find two tentative trends in the density-metallicity and density-insolation parameter space for the low-density super-Earths, which may hint at their composition. With a 8$\%$ precision in radius and 12$\%$ precision in mass, TOI-244 b is among the most precisely characterized super-Earths, which, together with the likely presence of an extended hydrosphere, makes it a key target for atmospheric observations.
