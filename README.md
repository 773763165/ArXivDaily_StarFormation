 - **Abstract**
 We present flux measurements of Uranus observed at phase angles of 43.9°, 44.0°, and 52.4° by the Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC) on the New Horizons spacecraft during 2023, 2010, and 2019, respectively. New Horizons imaged Uranus at a distance of about 24-70 AU (2023) in four color filters, with bandpasses of 400-550 nm, 540-700 nm, 780-975 nm, and 860-910 nm. High-phase-angle observations are of interest for studying the energy balance of Uranus, constraining the atmospheric scattering behavior, and understanding the planet as an analog for ice giant exoplanets. The new observations from New Horizons provide access to a wider wavelength range and different season compared to previous observations from both Voyager spacecraft. We performed aperture photometry on the New Horizons observations of Uranus to obtain its brightness in each photometric band. The photometry suggests that Uranus may be darker than predicted by a Lambertian phase curve in the Blue and Red filters. Comparison to simultaneous low-phase Hubble WFC3 and ground-based community-led observations indicates a lack of large-scale features at full-phase that would introduce variation in the rotational light curve. The New Horizons reflectance in the Blue (492 nm) and Red (624 nm) filters does not exhibit statistically significant variation and is consistent with the expected error bars. These results place new constraints on the atmospheric model of Uranus and its reflectivity. The observations are analogous to those from future exoplanet direct-imaging missions, which will capture unresolved images of exoplanets at partial phases. These results will serve as a "ground-truth" with which to interpret exo-ice giant data.

          Chemical Evolution of R-process Elements in Stars (CERES) II. The impact of stellar evolution and rotation on light and heavy elements

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen are the most abundant elements throughout the universe, after hydrogen and helium. Studying these elements in low-metallicity stars can provide crucial information on the chemical composition in the early Galaxy and possible internal mixing processes that can alter the surface composition of the stars. Aims. This work aims to investigate the chemical abundance patterns for CNO elements and Li in a homogeneously analyzed sample of 52 metal-poor halo giant stars. Methods. We used high-resolution spectra with a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) to carry out a spectral synthesis to derive detailed C, N, O, and Li abundances for a sample of stars with metallicities in the range of -3.58 <= [Fe/H] <= -1.79 dex. Our study was based on the assumption of one-dimensional (1D) local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) atmospheres. Results. Based on carbon and nitrogen abundances, we investigated the deep mixing taking place within stars along the red giant branch (RGB). The individual abundances of carbon decrease towards the upper RGB while nitrogen shows an increasing trend, indicating that carbon has been converted into nitrogen. No signatures of ON-cycle processed material were found for the stars in our sample. We computed a set of galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models, implementing different sets of massive star yields, both with and without including the effects of stellar rotation on nucleosynthesis. We confirm that stellar rotation is necessary to explain the highest [N/Fe] and [N/O] ratios observed in unmixed halo stars. The predicted level of N enhancement varies sensibly in dependence of the specific set of yields that are adopted. For stars with stellar parameters similar to those of our sample, heavy elements such as Sr, Y, and Zr appear to have unchanged abundances despite the stellar evolution mixing processes.

          A Planet Candidate Orbiting near the Hot Jupiter TOI-2818 b Inferred through Transit Timing

 - **Abstract**
 TOI-2818 b is a hot Jupiter orbiting a slightly evolved G-type star on a 4.04-day orbit that shows transit timing variations (TTVs) suggestive of a decreasing orbital period. In the most recent year of TESS observations, transits were observed $\sim$8 minutes earlier than expected for a constant period. The implied orbital decay rate is $1.35 \pm 0.25$ s yr$^{-1}$, too fast to be explained by tidal dissipation even considering the evolved nature of the host star. Radial velocity monitoring rules out the possibility that the apparent change in period is due to a steady acceleration of the star by a long-period companion. Apsidal precession due to the tidal distortion of the planet is also physically implausible. The most plausible explanation for the TTVs appears to be gravitational perturbations from a hitherto undetected planet with mass $\lesssim$$10\,M_\oplus$ that is in (or near) a mean-motion resonance with the hot Jupiter. Such a planet could be responsible for the observed TTVs while avoiding detection with the available radial velocity and transit data.

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying and removing binary stars from stellar samples is a crucial but complicated task. Regardless of how carefully a sample is selected, some binaries will remain and complicate interpretation of results, especially via flux contamination of survey photometry. One such sample is the data from the Gaia spacecraft, which is collecting photometry and astrometry of more than $10^{9}$ stars. To quantify the impact of binaries on Gaia photometry, we assembled a sample of known binary stars observed with adaptive optics and with accurately measured parameters, which we used to predict Gaia photometry for each stellar component. We compared the predicted photometry to the actual Gaia photometry for each system, and found that the contamination of Gaia photometry because of multiplicity decreases non-linearly from near-complete contamination ($\rho \leq 0''.15$) to no contamination (binary projected separation, or $\rho > 0''.3$). We provide an analytic relation to analytically correct photometric bias in a sample of Gaia stars using the binary separation. This correction is necessary because the Gaia PSF photometry extraction does not fully remove the secondary star flux for binaries with separations with $\rho \lesssim 0''.3$. We also evaluated the utility of various Gaia quality-of-fit metrics for identifying binary stars and found that RUWE remains the best indicator for unresolved binaries, but multi-peak image fraction probes a separation regime not currently accessible to RUWE.

          Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from forming Earth with the terrestrial planets

 - **Abstract**
 The motion of bodies ejected from the Earth was studied, and the probabilities of collisions of such bodies with the present terrestrial planets were calculated. The dependences of these probabilities on velocities, angles and points of ejection of bodies were studied. These dependences can be used in the models with different distributions of ejected material. On average, about a half and less than 10\% of initial ejected bodies remained moving in elliptical orbits in the Solar System after 10 and 100 Myr, respectively. A few ejected bodies collided with planets after 250 Myr. As dynamical lifetimes of bodies ejected from the Earth can reach hundreds of million years, a few percent of bodies ejected at the Chicxulub and Popigai events about 36-65 Myr ago can still move in the zone of the terrestrial planets and have small chances to collide with planets, including the Earth. The fraction of ejected bodies that collided with the Earth was greater for smaller ejection velocity. The fractions of bodies delivered to the Earth and Venus probably did not differ much for these planets and were about 0.2-0.3 each. Such obtained results testify in favour of that the upper layers of the Earth and Venus can contain similar material. The fractions of bodies ejected from the Earth that collided with Mercury and Mars did not exceed 0.08 and 0.025, respectively. The fractions of bodies collided with Jupiter were of the order of 0.001. In most calculations the fraction of bodies collided with the Sun was between 0.2 and 0.5. Depending on parameters of ejection, the fraction of bodies ejected into hyperbolic orbits could vary from 0 to 1. Small fractions of material ejected from the Earth can be found on other terrestrial planets and Jupiter, as the ejected bodies could collide with these planets. Bodies ejected from the Earth could deliver organic material to other celestial objects, e.g. to Mars.

 - **Abstract**
 We assess the variance of supernova(SN)-like explosions associated with the core collapse of rotating massive stars into a black hole-accretion disc system under changes in the progenitor structure. Our model of the central engine evolves the black hole and the disc through the transfer of matter and angular momentum and includes the contribution of the disc wind. We perform two-dimensional, non-relativistic, hydrodynamics simulations using the open-source hydrodynamic code Athena++, for which we develop a method to calculate self-gravity for axially symmetric density distributions. For a fixed model of the wind injection, we explore the explosion characteristics for progenitors with zero-age main-sequence masses from 9 to 40 $M_\odot$ and different degrees of rotation. Our outcomes reveal a wide range of explosion energies with $E_\mathrm{expl}$ spanning from $\sim 0.3\times10^{51}$~erg to $ > 8\times 10^{51}$~erg and ejecta mass $M_\mathrm{ej}$ from $\sim 0.6$ to $> 10 M_\odot$. Our results are in agreement with some range of the observational data of stripped-envelope and high-energy SNe such as broad-lined type Ic SNe, but we measure a stronger correlation between $E_\mathrm{expl}$ and $M_\mathrm{ej}$. We also provide an estimate of the $^{56}$Ni mass produced in our models which goes from $\sim0.04\;M_\odot$ to $\sim 1.3\;M_\odot$. The $^{56}$Ni mass shows a correlation with the mass and the angular velocity of the progenitor: more massive and faster rotating progenitors tend to produce a higher amount of $^{56}$Ni. Finally, we present a criterion that allows the selection of a potential collapsar progenitor from the observed explosion energy.

 - **Abstract**
 Proxima Cen (GJ 551; dM5.5e) is one of only about a dozen fully convective stars known to have a stellar cycle, and the only one to have long-term X-ray monitoring. A previous analysis found that X-ray and mid-UV observations, particularly two epochs of data from Swift, were consistent with a well sampled 7 yr optical cycle seen in ASAS data, but not convincing by themselves. The present work incorporates several years of new ASAS-SN optical data and an additional five years of Swift XRT and UVOT observations, with Swift observations now spanning 2009 to 2021 and optical coverage from late 2000. X-ray observations by XMM-Newton and Chandra are also included. Analysis of the combined data, which includes modeling and adjustments for stellar contamination in the optical and UV, now reveals clear cyclic behavior in all three wavebands with a period of 8.0 yr. We also show that UV and X-ray intensities are anti-correlated with optical brightness variations caused by the cycle and by rotational modulation, discuss possible indications of two coronal mass ejections, and provide updated results for the previous finding of a simple correlation between X-ray cycle amplitude and Rossby number over a wide range of stellar types and ages.

 - **Abstract**
 The exploration of kilometre-sized trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) is one of the ultimate goals in the search for the origin and evolution of the Solar System. However, such exploration is challenging because these small bodies are too faint to be directly detected. One potential avenue for detecting and investigating small and faint TNOs is the monitoring of stellar occultation events. This paper reviews the concept and methodology of monitoring observations of stellar occultations by small, unidentified TNOs, focusing on our observational programme, Organized Autotelescopes for Serendipitous Event Survey (OASES). OASES aims to detect and investigate stellar occultations by unidentified TNOs using multiple amateur-sized telescopes equipped with commercial Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) cameras. Through the monitoring observations conducted so far, OASES has found one possible occultation event by a kilometre-sized TNO. The paper also discusses future developments of the OASES project and deliberates on the potential of movie observations in expanding the frontiers of outer Solar System research. This article is part of the themed issue "Major Advances in Planetary Sciences thanks to Stellar Occultations".

          The Host Galaxy (If Any) of the Little Red Dots

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the host galaxy properties of eight little red dots (LRDs) selected from the JWST UNCOVER survey, applying a new technique ({\tt\string GalfitS}) to simultaneously fit the morphology and spectral energy distribution using multi-band NIRCam images covering $\sim 1-4\,\mu {\rm m}$. We detect the host galaxy in only one LRD, MSAID38108 at $z = 4.96$, which has a stellar mass of $\log (M_*/M_{\odot}) = 8.66^{+0.24}_{-0.23}$, an effective radius $R_e=0.66^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$ kpc, and a Sérsic index $n=0.71^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$. No host emission centered on the central point source is found in the other seven LRDs. We derive stringent upper limits for the stellar mass of a hypothetical host galaxy by conducting realistic mock simulations that place high-redshift galaxy images under the LRDs. Based on the black hole masses estimated from the broad H$\alpha$ emission line, the derived stellar mass limits are at least a factor of 10 lower than expected from the $z \approx 0$ scaling relation between black hole mass and host galaxy stellar mass. Intriguingly, four of the LRDs (50\% of the sample) show extended, off-centered emission, which is particularly prominent in the bluer bands. The asymmetric emission of two sources can be modeled as stellar emission, but the nature of the other two is unclear.

          Probing the origin of the extended flaring branch of Z-type X-ray binaries GX 340+0 and GX 5-1 using AstroSat

 - **Abstract**
 `Z' type neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries typically show a `Z'-like three-branched track in their hardness intensity diagram. However, a few such `Z' sources show an additional branch known as the extended flaring branch (EFB). EFB has been poorly studied, and its origin is not known. It is thought to be an extension of the flaring branch (FB) or associated with Fe K$\alpha$ complex or an additional continuum due to the radiative recombination continuum (RRC) process. Using AstroSat observations, we have detected the EFB from two `Z' sources, GX 340+0 and GX 5-1, and performed a broadband spectral analysis in the 0.5-22 keV energy range. During EFB, both sources show the presence of a significant RRC component with absorption edges at $7.91^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$ keV and $8.10^{+0.16}_{-0.17}$ keV, respectively along with blackbody radiation and thermal Comptonisation. No signature of RRC was detected during the FB, which is adjoint to the EFB. No Fe K$\alpha$ complex is detected. Interestingly, inside EFB dips of GX 5-1, for the first time, we have detected flaring events of 30-60s, which can be modelled with a single blackbody radiation. During the FB to EFB transition, an increase in the blackbody radius by a factor of 1.5-2 is observed in both sources. Our analysis strongly suggests that EFB is not an extension of FB or caused by the Fe K$\alpha$ complex. Rather, it is caused by a sudden expansion of the hot, thermalised boundary layer and subsequent rapid cooling.

          Evaluation of the single-component thermal dust emission model in CMB experiments

 - **Abstract**
 It is well known that multiple Galactic thermal dust emission components may exist along the line of sight, but a single-component approximation is still widely used, since a full multi-component estimation requires a large number of frequency bands that are only available with future experiments. In light of this, we present a reliable, quantitative, and sensitive criterion to test the goodness of all kinds of dust emission estimations. This can not only give a definite answer to the quality of current single-component approximations; but also help determine preconditions of future multi-component estimations. Upon the former, previous works usually depend on a more complicated model to improve the single-component dust emission; however, our method is free from any additional model, and is sensitive enough to directly discover a substantial discrepancy between the Planck HFI data (100-857 GHz) and associated single-component dust emission estimations. This is the first time that the single-component estimation is ruled out by the data itself. For the latter, a similar procedure will be able to answer two important questions for estimating the complicated Galactic emissions: the number of necessary foreground components and their types.

          Unveiling VVV/WISE Mira variables on the far side of the Galactic disk: Distances, kinematics and a new extinction law

 - **Abstract**
 The structure and kinematics of the Milky Way disk are largely inferred from the solar vicinity. To gain a comprehensive understanding, it is essential to find reliable tracers in less-explored regions like the bulge and the far side of the disk. Mira variables, which are well-studied and bright standard candles, offer an excellent opportunity to trace intermediate and old populations in these complex regions. We aim to isolate a clean sample of Miras in the Vista Variables in the Vía Láctea survey using Gaussian process algorithms. This sample will be used to study intermediate and old age populations in the Galactic bulge and far disk. Near- and mid-infrared time-series photometry were processed using Gaussian Process algorithms to identify Mira variables and model their light curves. We calibrated selection criteria with a visually inspected sample to create a high-purity sample of Miras, integrating multi-band photometry and kinematic data from proper motions. We present a catalog of 3602 Mira variables. By analyzing photometry, we classify them by O-rich or C-rich surface chemistry and derive selective-to-total extinction ratios of $A_{K_{s}}/E(J - K_{s}) = 0.471 \pm 0.01$ and $A_{K_{s}}/E(H - K_{s}) = 1.320 \pm 0.020$. Using the Mira period-age relation, we find evidence supporting the inside-out formation of the Milky Way disk. The distribution of proper motions and distances aligns with the Galactic rotation curve and disk kinematics. We extend the rotation curve up to R$_{\rm GC} \sim 17 \ \rm{kpc}$ and find no strong evidence of the nuclear stellar disk in our Mira sample. This study constitutes the largest catalog of variable stars on the far side of the Galactic disk to date.

          Identifying a point-symmetrical morphology in the core-collapse supernova remnant W44

 - **Abstract**
 I identify a point-symmetrical morphology in the core-collapse supernova remnant (CCSNR) W44 compatible with shaping by three or more pairs of jets in the jittering jet explosion mechanism (JJEM). Motivated by recent identifications of point-symmetrical morphologies in CCSNRs and their match to the JJEM, I revisit the morphological classification of CCSNR W44. I examine a radio map of W44 and find the outer bright rim of the radio map to possess a point-symmetric structure compatible with shaping by two energetic pairs of opposite jets rather than an S-shaped morphology shaped by a precessing pair of jets. An inner pair of filaments might hint at a third powerful pair of jets. More pairs of jets were involved in the explosion process. This study adds to the growing evidence that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae.

          The grazing angle icy protoplanetary disk PDS 453

 - **Abstract**
 PDS 453 is a rare highly inclined disk where the stellar photosphere is seen at grazing incidence on the disk surface. Our goal is take advantage of this geometry to constrain the structure and composition of this disk, in particular the fact that it shows a 3.1 $\mu$m water ice band in absorption that can be related uniquely to the disk. We observed the system in polarized intensity with the VLT/SPHERE instrument, as well as in polarized light and total intensity using the HST/NICMOS camera. Infrared archival photometry and a spectrum showing the water ice band are used to model the spectral energy distribution under Mie scattering theory. Based on these data, we fit a model using the radiative transfer code MCFOST to retrieve the geometry and dust and ice content of the disk. PDS 453 has the typical morphology of a highly inclined system with two reflection nebulae where the disk partially attenuates the stellar light. The upper nebula is brighter than the lower nebula and shows a curved surface brightness profile in polarized intensity, indicating a ring-like structure. With an inclination of 80° estimated from models, the line-of-sight crosses the disk surface and a combination of absorption and scattering by ice-rich dust grains produces the water ice band. PDS 453 is seen highly inclined and is composed of a mixture of silicate dust and water ice. The radial structure of the disk includes a significant jump in density and scale height at a radius of 70 au in order to produce a ring-like image. The depth of the 3.1 $\mu$m water ice band depends on the amount of water ice, until it saturates when the optical thickness along the line-of-sight becomes too large. Therefore, quantifying the exact amount of water from absorption bands in edge-on disks requires a detailed analysis of the disk structure and tailored radiative transfer modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 Machine learning models in astrophysics are often limited in scope and cannot adapt to data from new instruments or tasks. We introduce SpectraFM, a Transformer-based foundation model architecture that can be pre-trained on stellar spectra from any wavelength range and instrument. SpectraFM excels in generalization by combining flexibility with knowledge transfer from pre-training, allowing it to outperform traditional machine learning methods, especially in scenarios with limited training data. Our model is pre-trained on approximately 90k examples of synthetic spectra to predict the chemical abundances (Fe, Mg, O), temperature, and specific gravity of stars. We then fine-tune the model on real spectra to adapt it to observational data before fine-tuning it further on a restricted 100-star training set in a different wavelength range to predict iron abundance. Despite a small iron-rich training set of real spectra, transfer learning from the synthetic spectra pre-training enables the model to perform well on iron-poor stars. In contrast, a neural network trained from scratch fails at this task. We investigate the Transformer attention mechanism and find that the wavelengths receiving attention carry physical information about chemical composition. By leveraging the knowledge from pre-training and its ability to handle non-spectra inputs, SpectraFM reduces the need for large training datasets and enables cross-instrument and cross-domain research. Its adaptability makes it well-suited for tackling emerging challenges in astrophysics, like extracting insights from multi-modal datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Nonlinear cosmological fields like galaxy density and lensing convergence can be approximately related to Gaussian fields via analytic point transforms. The lognormal transform (LN) has been widely used and is a simple example of a function that relates nonlinear fields to Gaussian fields. We consider more accurate General Point-Transformed Gaussian (GPTG) functions for such a mapping and apply them to convergence maps. We show that we can create maps that preserve the LN's ability to exactly match any desired power spectrum but go beyond LN by significantly improving the accuracy of the probability distribution function (PDF). With the aid of symbolic regression, we find a remarkably accurate GPTG function for convergence maps: its higher-order moments, scattering wavelet transform, Minkowski functionals, and peak counts match those of N-body simulations to the statistical uncertainty expected from tomographic lensing maps of the Rubin LSST 10 years survey. Our five-parameter function performs 2 to 5$\times$ better than the lognormal. We restrict our study to scales above about 7 arcmin; baryonic feedback alters the mass distribution on smaller scales. We demonstrate that the GPTG can robustly emulate variations in cosmological parameters due to the simplicity of the analytic transform. This opens up several possible applications, such as field-level inference, rapid covariance estimation, and other uses based on the generation of arbitrarily many maps with laptop-level computation capability.

 - **Abstract**
 This document summarizes the discussions which took place during the PITT-PACC Workshop entitled "Non-Standard Cosmological Epochs and Expansion Histories," held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Sept. 5-7, 2024. Much like the non-standard cosmological epochs that were the subject of these discussions, the format of this workshop was also non-standard. Rather than consisting of a series of talks from participants, with each person presenting their own work, this workshop was instead organized around free-form discussion blocks, with each centered on a different overall theme and guided by a different set of Discussion Leaders. This document is not intended to serve as a comprehensive review of these topics, but rather as an informal record of the discussions that took place during the workshop, in the hope that the content and free-flowing spirit of these discussions may inspire new ideas and research directions.

 Context. Photochemistry is a key process driving planetary atmospheres away from local thermodynamic equilibrium. Recent observations of the H$_2$ dominated atmospheres of hot gas giants have detected SO$_2$ as one of the major products of this process. Aims. We investigate which chemical pathways lead to the formation of SO$_2$ in an atmosphere, and we investigate which part of the flux from the host star is necessary to initiate SO$_2$ production. Methods. We use the publicly available S-N-C-H-O photochemical network in the VULCAN chemical kinetics code to compute the disequilibrium chemistry of an exoplanetary atmosphere. Results. We find that there are two distinct chemical pathways that lead to the formation of SO$_2$. The formation of SO$_2$ at higher pressures is initiated by stellar flux >200 nm, whereas the formation of SO$_2$ at lower pressures is initiated by stellar flux <200 nm. In deeper layers of the atmosphere, OH is provided by the hydrogen abstraction of H$_2$O, and sulfur is provided by the photodissociation of SH and S$_2$, which leads to a positive feedback cycle that liberates sulfur from the stable H$_2$S molecule. In higher layers of the atmosphere, OH is provided by the photodissociation of H$_2$O, and sulfur can be liberated from H$_2$S by either photodissociation of SH and S$_2$, or by the hydrogen abstraction of SH. Conclusions. We conclude that the stellar flux in the 200-350 nm wavelength range as well as the ratio of NUV/UV radiation are important parameters determining the observability of SO$_2$. In addition we find that there is a diversity of chemical pathways to the formation of SO$_2$. This is crucial for the interpretation of SO$_2$ detections and derived elemental abundance ratios and overall metallicities.

 - **Abstract**
 The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at Vera C. Rubin Observatory is planned to begin in the Fall of 2025. The LSST survey cadence has been designed via a community-driven process regulated by the Survey Cadence Optimization Committee (SCOC), which recommended up to 3% of the observing time to carry out Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations. Experts from the scientific community, Rubin Observatory personnel, and members of the SCOC were brought together to deliver a recommendation for the implementation of the ToO program during a workshop held in March 2024. Four main science cases were identified: gravitational wave multi-messenger astronomy, high energy neutrinos, Galactic supernovae, and small potentially hazardous asteroids possible impactors. Additional science cases were identified and briefly addressed in the documents, including lensed or poorly localized gamma-ray bursts and twilight discoveries. Trigger prioritization, automated response, and detailed strategies were discussed for each science case. This document represents the outcome of the Rubin ToO 2024 workshop, with additional contributions from members of the Rubin Science Collaborations. The implementation of the selection criteria and strategies presented in this document has been endorsed in the SCOC Phase 3 Recommendations document (PSTN-056). Although the ToO program is still to be finalized, this document serves as a baseline plan for ToO observations with the Rubin Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of cosmic antideuterons ($\overline{\rm D}$) at kinetic energies below a few GeV/n could provide a smoking gun signature for dark matter (DM). However, the theoretical uncertainties of coalescence models have represented so far one of the main limiting factors for precise predictions of the $\overline{\rm D}$ flux. In this Letter we present a novel calculation of the $\overline{\rm D}$ source spectra, based on the Wigner formalism, for which we implement the Argonne $v_{18}$ antideuteron wavefunction that does not have any free parameters related to the coalescence process. We show that the Argonne Wigner model excellently reproduces the $\overline{\rm D}$ multiplicity measured by ALEPH at the $Z$-boson pole, which is usually adopted to tune the coalescence models based on different approaches. Our analysis is based on Pythia~8 Monte Carlo event generator and the state-of-the-art Vincia shower algorithm. We succeed, with our model, to reduce the current theoretical uncertainty on the prediction of the $\overline{\rm D}$ source spectra to a few percent, for $\overline{\rm D}$ kinetic energies relevant to DM searches with GAPS and AMS, and for DM masses above a few tens of GeV. This result implies that the theoretical uncertainties due to the coalescence process are no longer the main limiting factor in the predictions. We provide the tabulated source spectra for all the relevant DM annihilation/decay channels and DM masses between 5 GeV and 100 TeV, on the CosmiXs github repository (this https URL).

 - **Abstract**
 We present spectroscopy of the accreting X-ray binary and millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. These observations are the first to be obtained during a reflaring phase. We collected spectroscopic data during the beginning of reflaring of the 2019 outburst and we compare them to previous datasets, taken at different epochs both of the same outburst and across the years. In order to do so, we also present spectra of the source taken during quiescence in 2007, one year before the next outburst. We made use of data taken by the Very Large Telescope (VLT) X-shooter spectrograph on August 31, 2019, three weeks after the outburst peak. For flux calibration, we used photometric data taken during the same night by the 1m telescopes from the Las Cumbres Observatory network that are located in Chile. We compare our spectra to the quiescent data taken by the VLT-FORS1 spectrograph in September 2007. We inspected the spectral energy distribution by fitting our data with a multi-colour accretion disk model and sampled the posterior probability density function for the model parameters with a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We find the optical spectra of the 2019 outburst to be unusually featureless, with no emission lines present despite the high resolution of the instrument. Fitting the UV-optical spectral energy distribution with a disk plus irradiated star model results in a very large value for the inner disk radius of $\sim 5130 \pm 240$ km, which could suggest that the disk has been emptied of material during the outburst, possibly accounting for the emission-less spectra. Alternatively, the absence of emission lines could be due to a significant contribution of the jet emission at optical wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 Bow shocks generated by pulsars moving through weakly ionized interstellar medium (ISM) produce emission dominated by non-equilibrium atomic transitions. These bow shocks are primarily observed as H$_\alpha$ nebulae. We developed a package, named Shu, that calculates non-LTE intensity maps in more than 150 spectral lines, taking into account geometrical properties of the pulsars' motion and lines of sight. We argue here that atomic (CI, NI, OI) and ionic (SII, NII, OIII, NeIV) transitions can be used as complementary and sensitive probes of ISM. We perform self-consistent 2D relativistic hydrodynamic calculations of the bow shock structure and generate non-LTE emissivity maps, combining global dynamics of relativistic flows, and detailed calculations of the non-equilibrium ionization states. We find that though typically H$_\alpha$ emission is dominant, spectral fluxes in OIII, SII and NII may become comparable for relatively slowly moving pulsars. Overall, morphology of non-LTE emission, especially of the ionic species, is a sensitive probe of the density structures of the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Even though the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) mission does not exclude a dynamical dark energy evolution, the concordance paradigm, i.e., the $\Lambda$CDM model, remains statistically favored, as it depends on the fewest number of free parameters. In this respect, high redshift astrophysical sources, such as gamma-ray bursts, represent a formidable tool to model the form of dark energy, since they may provide a link between early and local redshift regimes. Hence, the use of these objects as possible distance indicators turns out to be essential to investigate the cosmological puzzle. To this end, we adopt two gamma-ray burst linear correlations, namely the $L_p-E_p$ and $L_0-E_p-T$ relations, to test the flat and non-flat $\Lambda$CDM, $\omega_0$CDM, and $\omega_0\omega_1$CDM cosmological models, i.e., those directly examined by the DESI collaboration. The inferred correlation coefficients and cosmological parameters are thus obtained by considering two independent Monte Carlo Markov chain analyses, the first considering the whole DESI data set and the second excluding a seemingly problematic data point placed at $z_{eff} = 0.51$. Using model selection criteria, the two above correlations do not show a preference on a precise cosmological model although, when the data point at $z_{eff}$ is included, the concordance paradigm appears to be the least favored among the tested cosmological models.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the dynamics of razor-thin, stone-cold, self-gravitating discs. By recasting the equations into standard cylindrical coordinates, the linearised vertical dynamics of an exponential disc can be followed for several gigayears on a laptop in a few minutes. An initially warped disc rapidly evolves into a flat inner region and an outward-propagating spiral corrugation wave that rapidly winds up and would quickly thicken a disc with non-zero radial velocity dispersion. The Sgr dwarf galaxy generates a similar warp in the Galactic disc as it passes through pericentre, and the warp generated by the dwarf's last pericentre ~ 35 Myr ago is remarkably similar to the warp traced by the Galaxy's HI disc. The resemblance to the observed warp is fleeting but its timing is perfect. For the adopted parameters the amplitude of the model warp is a factor 3 too small, but there are several reasons for this being so. The marked flaring of our Galaxy's low-alpha disc just outside the solar circle can be explained as a legacy of earlier pericentres.

 - **Abstract**
 The nucleosynthetic isotope signatures of meteorites and the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) indicate that Earth consists of a mixture of "carbonaceous" (CC) and "non-carbonaceous" (NC) materials. We show that the fration of CC material recorded in the isotopic composition of the BSE varies for different elements, and depends on the element's tendency to partition into metal and its volatility. The observed behaviour indicates that the majority of material accreted to the Earth was NC-dominated, but that CC-dominated material enriched in moderately-volatile elements by a factor of ~10 was delivered during the last ~2-10% of Earth's acccretion. The late delivery of CC material to Earth contrasts with dynamical evidence for the early implantation of CC objects into the inner solar system during the growth and migration of the giant planets. This, together with the NC-dominated nature of both Earth's late veneer and bulk Mars, suggests that material scattered inwards had the bulk of its mass concentrated in a few, large CC embryos rather than in smaller planetesimals. We propose that Earth accreted a few of these CC embryos while Mars did not, and that at least one of the CC embryos impacted Earth relatively late (when accretion was 90-90% complete). This scenario is consistent with the subsequent Moon-formign impact of a large NC body, as long as this impact did not re-homogenize the entire Earth's mantle.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-epoch Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of the symbiotic system R Aquarii (R Aqr) spanning 22 yr are analysed by means of a reflection model produced by an accretion disc. This methodology helps dissecting the contribution from different components in the X-ray spectra of R Aqr: the soft emission from the jet and extended emission, the heavily-extinguished plasma component of the boundary layer and the reflection contribution, which naturally includes the 6.4 keV Fe fluorescent line. The evolution with time of the different components is studied for epochs between 2000 Sep and 2022 Dec, and it is found that the fluxes of the boundary layer and that of the reflecting component increase as the stellar components in R Aqr approach periastron passage, a similar behaviour is exhibited by the shocked plasma produced by the precessing jet. Using publicly available optical and UV data we are able to study the evolution of the mass-accretion rate $\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc}$ and the wind accretion efficiency $\eta$ during periastron. These exhibit a small degree of variability with median values of $\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc}$=7.3$\times10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and $\eta$=7$\times10^{-3}$. We compare our estimations with predictions from a modified Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 Time-varying inhomogeneities on stellar surfaces constitute one of the largest sources of radial velocity (RV) error for planet detection and characterization. We show that stellar variations, because they manifest on coherent, rotating surfaces, give rise to changes that are complex but useably compact and coherent in the spectral domain. Methods for disentangling stellar signals in RV measurements benefit from modeling the full domain of spectral pixels. We simulate spectra of spotted stars using starry and construct a simple spectrum projection space that is sensitive to the orientation and size of stellar surface features. Regressing measured RVs in this projection space reduces RV scatter by 60-80% while preserving planet shifts. We note that stellar surface variability signals do not manifest in spectral changes that are purely orthogonal to a Doppler shift or exclusively asymmetric in line profiles; enforcing orthogonality or focusing exclusively on asymmetric features will not make use of all the information present in the spectra. We conclude with a discussion of existing and possible implementations on real data based on the presented compact, coherent framework for stellar signal mitigation.

 - **Abstract**
 The MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration Survey (MIGHTEE) is one of the large survey projects using the MeerKAT telescope, covering four fields that have a wealth of ancillary data available. We present Data Release 1 of the MIGHTEE continuum survey, releasing total intensity images and catalogues over $\sim$20 deg$^2$, across three fields at $\sim$1.2-1.3 GHz. This includes 4.2 deg$^2$ over the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field, 14.4 deg$^2$ over the XMM Large-Scale Structure (XMM-LSS) field and deeper imaging over 1.5 deg$^2$ of the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS). We release images at both a lower resolution (7-9 arcsec) and higher resolution ($\sim 5$ arcsec). These images have central rms sensitivities of $\sim$1.3$-$2.7 $\mu $Jy beam$^{-1}$ ($\sim$1.2$-$3.6 $\mu $Jy beam$^{-1}$) in the lower (higher) resolution images respectively. We also release catalogues comprised of $\sim$144~000 ($\sim$114 000) sources using the lower (higher) resolution images. We compare the astrometry and flux-density calibration with the Early Science data in the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields and previous radio observations in the CDFS field, finding broad agreement. Furthermore, we extend the source counts at the $\sim$10 $\mu$Jy level to these larger areas ($\sim 20$ deg$^2$) and, using the areal coverage of MIGHTEE we measure the sample variance for differing areas of sky. We find a typical sample variance of 10-20 per cent for 0.3 and 0.5 sq. deg. sub-regions at $S_{1.4} \leq 200$ $\mu $Jy, which increases at brighter flux densities, given the lower source density and expected higher galaxy bias for these sources.

 - **Abstract**
 The ongoing discrepancy in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) estimates obtained through local distance ladder methods and early universe observations poses a significant challenge to the $\Lambda$CDM model, suggesting potential new physics. Type II supernovae (SNe II) offer a promising technique for determining $H_0$ in the local universe independently of the traditional distance ladder approach, opening up a complimentary path for testing this discrepancy. We aim to provide the first $H_0$ estimate using the tailored expanding photosphere method (EPM) applied to SNe II, made possible by recent advancements in spectral modelling that enhance its precision and efficiency. Our tailored EPM measurement utilizes a spectral emulator to interpolate between radiative transfer models calculated with TARDIS, allowing us to fit supernova spectra efficiently and derive self-consistent values for luminosity-related parameters. We apply the method on public data for ten SNe II at redshifts between 0.01 and 0.04. Our analysis demonstrates that the tailored EPM allows for $H_0$ measurements with precision comparable to the most competitive established techniques, even when applied to literature data not designed for cosmological applications. We find an independent $H_0$ value of $74.9\pm1.9$ (stat) km/s/Mpc, which is consistent with most current local measurements. Considering dominant sources of systematic effects, we conclude that our systematic uncertainty is comparable to or less than the current statistical uncertainty. This proof-of-principle study highlights the potential of the tailored EPM as a robust and precise tool for investigating the Hubble tension independently of the local distance ladder. Observations of SNe II tailored to $H_0$ estimation can make this an even more powerful tool by improving the precision and by allowing us to better understand and control systematic uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 Axion-like particles may form a network of cosmic strings in the Universe today that can rotate the plane of polarization of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. Future CMB observations with improved sensitivity might detect this axion-string-induced birefringence effect, thereby revealing an as-yet unseen constituent of the Universe and offering a new probe of particles and forces that are beyond the Standard Model of Elementary Particle Physics. In this work, we explore how spherical convolutional neural networks (SCNNs) may be used to extract information about the axion string network from simulated birefringence maps. We construct a pipeline to simulate the anisotropic birefringence that would arise from an axion string network, and we train SCNNs to estimate three parameters related to the cosmic string length, the cosmic string abundance, and the axion-photon coupling. Our results demonstrate that neural networks are able to extract information from a birefringence map that is inaccessible with two-point statistics alone (i.e., the angular power spectrum). We also assess the impact of noise on the accuracy of our SCNN estimators, demonstrating that noise at the level anticipated for Stage IV (CMB-S4) measurements would significantly bias parameter estimation for SCNNs trained on noiseless simulated data, and necessitate modeling the noise in the training data.
