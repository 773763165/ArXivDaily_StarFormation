 - **Abstract**
 A core-corona decomposition of compact (neutron) star models is compared to recent NICER data of masses and radii. It is in particular interesting to capture the outlier XTE~J1814-338. Instead of integrating the TOV equations from the center to surface, we follow here another pathway by accommodating all uncertainties of the equation(s) of state (EoS) at supra-nuclear density or/and an unknown dark matter admixture in a parameterization of the core by its radius $r_x$, the included mass $m_x$ and the pressure $p_x$ at $r_x$. The corona, which may be dubbed also envelope or halo or outer crust, is assumed to be of standard-model matter where the EoS is supposed to be faithfully known.

 - **Abstract**
 The paper explores the use of various machine learning methods to search for heterogeneous or atypical structures on astronomical maps. The study was conducted on the maps of the cosmic microwave background radiation from the Planck mission obtained at various frequencies. The algorithm used found a number of atypical anomalous structures in the actual maps of the Planck mission. This paper details the machine learning model used and the algorithm for detecting anomalous structures. A map of the position of such objects has been compiled. The results were compared with known astrophysical processes or objects. Future research involves expanding the dataset and applying various algorithms to improve the detection and classification of outliers.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological data collected on a sphere, such as CMB anisotropies, are typically represented by the spherical harmonic coefficients, denoted as $a_{\ell m}$. The angular power spectrum, or $C_\ell$, serves as the fundamental estimator of the variance in this data. Alternatively, spherical data and their variance can also be characterized using Multipole Vectors (MVs) and the Fréchet variance. The vectors that minimize this variance, known as Fréchet Vectors (FVs), define the center of mass of points on a compact space, making them highly sensitive to small displacements of these points. This sensitivity makes FVs excellent indicators of statistical correlations between different multipoles. We demonstrate this using both simulations and real data. Through simulations, we show that FVs enable a blind detection and reconstruction of the location associated with a mock Cold Spot anomaly introduced in an otherwise isotropic sky. Applying this to the 2018 Planck maps, we implement several improvements on previous model-independent tests of Gaussianity and statistical isotropy, down to arc-minute scales. When compared with simulated maps that incorporate masking and anisotropic noise, for $2 \leq\ell \leq 1500$, while Planck's MVs appear consistent with these hypotheses, the corresponding FVs reject them with significances between 5.2 and $8.3\sigma$, depending on the component separation method.

          Stellar Obliquity Excitation via Disk Dispersal-Driven Resonances in Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar obliquity of a planetary system is often used to help constrain the system's formation and evolution. One of the mechanisms to reorient the stellar spin involves a secular resonance crossing due to the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk when the system also has an inclined, distant ($\sim 300\;\mathrm{AU}$) binary companion. This mechanism is likely to operate broadly due to the $\sim 50\%$ binary fraction of FGK dwarfs and can play an important role in setting the initial stellar obliquities prior to any dynamical evolution. In this work, we revisit this mechanism analytically for idealized, homologously evolving disk models and show that the resulting stellar obliquities are broadly distributed between $60^\circ$ and $180^\circ$ for most warm and cold planets. We further show that non-homologus disk dissipation, such as the development of a photoevaporatively-opened gap at $\sim 2\;\mathrm{AU}$, can help maintain orbital alignment of warm planets, in agreement with observations. Our results represent the proper primordial obliquities for planetary systems with distant binary companions. They also represent the obliquities of stars with no present-day binary companions if these companions are dynamically unbound during the birth cluster phase of evolution, a process that occurs on a comparable timescale as the disk-driven obliquity excitation.

          Tracing back a second-generation star stripped from Terzan 5 by the Galactic bar

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic bulge hosts the Milky Way's oldest stars, possibly coming from disrupted globular clusters (GCs) or the bulge's primordial building blocks, making these stars witnesses to the Galaxy's early chemical enrichment. The Galactic bar currently dominates the bulge's region, altering the orbits of objects formed before its formation and complicating the trace of the field stars' original clusters. Here, we present the discovery of a fossil record of this evolution, SOS1 -- a star trapped in the bar, exhibiting significant enhancements in nitrogen, sodium, and aluminum, typical of second-generation GC stars. SOS1 also shows an s-process Ce enhancement, suggesting an old age and early enrichment by fast-rotating massive stars in the Galaxy's earliest phases. With the purpose of finding the SOS1's parent GC, we derive its precise chemodynamical properties by combining high-precision proper motions from Gaia with APOGEE detailed chemical abundances. Our analysis suggests that SOS1 was possibly stripped from the GC Terzan 5 by the Galactic bar's gravitational influence approximately 350 Myr ago. We also found chemical similarities suggesting that SOS1 belonged to the most metal-poor, ancient, and peripheral stellar population of Terzan 5. These results not only support the hypothesis that Terzan 5 is a remnant of a primordial building block of the Galactic bulge, but also suggest this cluster continues losing stars to the bar. Our method highlights how powerful the use of chemodynamical properties in the Gaia era is for tracing the Galaxy's evolutionary history.

          Evolution of binaries containing a hot subdwarf and a white dwarf to double white dwarfs, and double detonation supernovae with hypervelocity runaway stars

 - **Abstract**
 Compact binaries containing hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs have the potential to evolve into a variety of explosive transients. These systems could also explain hypervelocity runaway stars such as US 708. We use the detailed binary evolution code MESA to evolve hot subdwarf and white dwarf stars interacting in binaries. We explore their evolution towards double detonation supernovae, helium novae, or double white dwarfs. Our grid of 3120 models maps from initial conditions such as orbital period and masses of hot subdwarf and white dwarf to these outcomes. The minimum amount of helium required to ignite the helium shell that leads to a double detonation supernova in our grid is $\approx 0.05 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, likely too large to produce spectra similar to normal type Ia supernovae, but compatible with inferred helium shell masses from some observed peculiar type I supernovae. We also provide the helium shell masses for our double white dwarf systems, with a maximum He shell mass of $\approx 0.18\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. In our double detonation systems, the orbital velocity of the surviving donor star ranges from $\approx 450 \, \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ to $\approx 1000 \, \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Among the surviving donors, we also estimate the runaway velocities of proto-white dwarfs, which have higher runaway velocities than hot subdwarf stars of the same mass. Our grid will provide a first-order estimate of the potential outcomes for the observation of binaries containing hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs from future missions like Gaia, LSST, and LISA.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray imaging and spatially-resolved spectroscopy, as well as new MUSTANG2 90~GHz observations of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich from MACS J0717.5+3745, an intermediate redshift ($z = 0.5458$) and exceptionally massive ($3.5 \pm 0.6 \times 10^{15}~\rm M_\odot$) Frontier Fields cluster experiencing multiple mergers and hosting an apparent X-ray bright large scale structure filament. Thermodynamical maps are produced from Chandra, XMM-Newton, and ROSAT data using a new method for modelling the astrophysical and instrumental backgrounds. The temperature peak of $24 \pm 4$ keV is also the pressure peak of the cluster and closely correlates spatially with the Sunyaev-Zeldovich peak from the MUSTANG2 data. The cluster center hosts shock fronts to the north and south, for which we report lower limits for the shock Mach numbers of $M = 1.6 \pm 0.4$ and $M = 1.9 \pm 0.3$, respectively. Bayesian X-ray Analysis methods were used to disentangle different projected spectral signatures for the filament structure, with Akaike and Bayes criteria being used to select the most appropriate model to describe the various temperature components. We report an X-ray filament temperature of $2.9_{-0.3}^{+0.5}$ keV and a density $(1.60\pm0.05)\times10^{-4}\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$, corresponding to an overdensity of 150 relative to the critical density of the Universe. We estimate the hot gas mass of the filament to be $\sim4.4\times10^{12}~\rm M_\odot$, while its total projected weak lensing measured mass is $\sim 6.8 \pm 2.7 \times 10^{13}~\rm M_\odot$, indicating a hot baryon fraction of 4-10\%.

          Intranight optical monitoring of the rare quasar J0950+5128, the brightest known candidate for transition from radio-quiet to radio-loud state

 - **Abstract**
 We report a novel pilot project to characterise intra-night optical variability (INOV) of an extremely rare type of quasar, which has recently been caught in the act of transiting from a radio-quiet to radio-loud state, on a decadal time scale. Such rare transitions may signify a recurrence, or conceivably the first switch-on of jet activity in optically luminous quasars. The newly formed jet could well be jittery and unsteady, both in power and direction. The optically brightest among such radio-state transition candidates, the quasar J0950+5128 ($z = 0.2142$), was monitored by us with dense sampling in the R-band, during 2020-21 in 6 sessions, each lasting $>$ 4 hours. This is the first attempt to characterise the INOV properties associated with this recently discovered, extremely rarely observed phenomenon of quasar radio-state transition. The non-detection of INOV in any of the 6 sessions, down to the 1-2% level, amounts to a lack of evidence for a blazar-like optical activity, $\sim$ 2 years after its transition to radio-loud state was found. The only INOV feature detected in J0950+5128 during our observational campaign was a $\sim$ 0.15-mag spike lasting < 6 minutes, seen at 13.97 UT on 18-March-2021. We also report the available optical light curves of this quasar from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey, which indicate that it had experienced a phase of INOV activity around the time its transition to the radio-loud state was detected, however that phase did not sustain until the launch of our INOV campaign $\sim$ 2 years later.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrogen, the most abundant element in the Universe, has traditionally been used to investigate astrophysical processes within and around our own Galaxy. In its chemically neutral, atomic form (known as HI in the astronomical literature), it has tremendous potential today as a tool for precision cosmology and testing theories of fundamental physics. Cosmological HI is accessed through two of its main spectral lines: the Lyman-$\alpha$, with a rest wavelength of 1216 $Å$, in the ultraviolet and visible part of the spectrum, and the 21-cm, which manifests in the radio frequency band. A plethora of radio telescopes worldwide are focused on detecting the faint 21 cm signal from the dark ages and Cosmic Dawn, some of the earliest epochs of the Universe. This chapter will describe the formalism for doing cosmology with HI, the recent results from the facilities and their prospects for studying the evolution of the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Coupled-mode theory (CMT) is a powerful tool for simulating near-harmonic systems. In telecommunications, variations of the theory have been used extensively to study waveguides, both analytically and through numerical modelling. Analogous mathematical techniques to the CMT are also widely used in quantum mechanics. The purpose of this work is to collect different formulations of the CMT and their underlying connections to quantum mechanical techniques, and to showcase their utility in modelling slowly varying waveguides including directional couplers and photonic lanterns. My choice of example waveguides is motivated by the astronomical applications of such devices in starlight nulling, wavefront sensing, and high-resolution spectroscopy. I first provide a brief review of the standard form of the CMT, applicable for waveguides with fixed eigenmodes. Next, I show that the CMT also applies for slowly varying waveguides, and demonstrate the close relation between the CMT and several well-known approximation methods from quantum mechanics, as well as concepts like geometric phase. Finally, I present a verification of my analysis, in the form of the numerical package cbeam.

 - **Abstract**
 Binaries are known to play a key role in the mass loss and dynamical environments of evolved stars. Stellar and sub-stellar companion interactions produce complex wind morphologies including rotating/expanding disks, bipolar outflows, and spiral wind patterns; however, the connection between these many structures and the gas phase chemistry they harbor is not well-constrained. To expand the sample of chemical inventories in interacting systems, we present a detailed spectroscopic case study of the binary C-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star V Hya. Using spatially resolved ALMA observations at Bands 3, 6 and 7, we characterize the rotational emission lines and distributions of molecules in its surrounding disk undergoing dynamical expansion (DUDE). We detect emission from over 15 molecules and isotopologues toward this source, and present resolved maps for the brightest tracers of carbonaceous chemistry (e.g. CCH, C4H, HC5N, HNC, CH3CN). Employing LTE and non-LTE models of emission from the DUDE, we estimate the abundance distributions for optically thin species, and compare them with prototypical carbon-rich AGB envelopes. We find that the average abundances of detected species are within a factor of ${\sim}5$ from sources with similar mass-loss rates; however, the distribution of daughter species in V Hya is much more compact, with carbon chain species (CCH, C4H, HC3N) appearing with abundances $>$10$^{-7}$ even in the innermost sampled regions (200 au) of the disk.

          Assessing the growth of structure over cosmic time with CMB lensing

 - **Abstract**
 The standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model informed by cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies makes a precise prediction for the growth of matter density fluctuations over cosmic time on linear scales. A variety of cosmological observables offer independent and complementary ways of testing this prediction, but results have been mixed, with many constraints on the amplitude of structure $S_8$ being 2-3$\sigma$ lower than the expectation from Planck primary CMB anisotropies. It is currently unclear whether these discrepancies are due to observational systematics, non-linearities and baryonic effects or new physics. We review how gravitational lensing of the CMB has and will continue to provide insights into this problem, including through tomographic cross-correlations with galaxy surveys over cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of TOI-6303b and TOI-6330b, two massive transiting super-Jupiters orbiting a M0 and a M2 star respectively, as part of the Searching for GEMS survey. These were detected by TESS and then confirmed via ground-based photometry and radial velocity observations with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF). TOI-6303b has a mass of 7.84 +/- 0.31 MJ, a radius of 1.03 +/- 0.06 RJ , and an orbital period of 9.485 days. TOI-6330b has a mass of 10.00 +/- 0.31 MJ , a radius of 0.97 +/- 0.03 RJ , and an orbital period of 6.850 days. We put these planets in context of super-Jupiters around M-dwarfs discovered from radial-velocity surveys, as well as recent discoveries from astrometry. These planets have masses that can be attributed to two dominant planet formation mechanisms - gravitational instability and core-accretion. Their masses necessitate massive protoplanetary disks that should either be gravitationally unstable, i.e. forming through gravitational instability, or be amongst some of the most massive protoplanetary disks to form objects through core-accretion. We also discuss the eccentricity distribution of these objects, as a potential indicator of their formation and evolutionary mechanisms.

 The Solar Neutrino and Astro-Particle PhYsics (SNAPPY) Cubesat is expected to launch in 2025 and it will carry into a polar orbit a prototype test detector for solar neutrino background studies while over the Earth's poles for the neutrino Solar Orbiting Laboratory future project ($\nu$SOL). During this flight it is possible to do other science measurements. One of these is an improved study of the solar wind particles through improved particle identification and energy measurements. This study aimed to understand how well could the solar wind particles be identified using the planned detector but instead of using the veto array as an anti-coincidence it would be used as a $\Delta$E energy sampling of a phoswich particle ID system.

 - **Abstract**
 Free electrons in the interstellar medium refract and diffract radio waves along multiple paths, resulting in angular and temporal broadening of radio pulses that limits pulsar timing precision. We determine multifrequency, multi-epoch scattering times for the large dispersion measure millisecond pulsar J1903+0327 by developing a three component model for the emitted pulse shape that is convolved with a best fit pulse broadening function (PBF) identified from a family of thin-screen and extended-media PBFs. We show that the scattering time, $\tau$, at a fiducial frequency of 1500 MHz changes by approximately 10% over a 5.5yr span with a characteristic timescale of approximately 100 days. We also constrain the spectral index and inner scale of the wavenumber spectrum of electron density variations along this line of sight. We find that the scaling law for $\tau$ vs. radio frequency is strongly affected by any mismatch between the true and assumed PBF or between the true and assumed intrinsic pulse shape. We show using simulations that refraction is a plausible cause of the epoch dependence of $\tau$, manifesting as changes in the PBF shape and $1/e$ time scale. Finally, we discuss the implications of our scattering results on pulsar timing including time of arrival delays and dispersion measure misestimation.

 - **Abstract**
 Ever since they were first detected in the interstellar medium, the radio wavelength (3.3 GHz) hyperfine-structure splitting transitions in the rotational ground state of CH have been observed to show anomalous excitation. Astonishingly, this behaviour has been uniformly observed towards a variety of different sources probing a wide range of physical conditions. While the observed level inversion can be explained globally by a pumping scheme involving collisions, a description of the extent of 'over-excitation' observed in individual sources requires the inclusion of radiative processes, involving transitions at higher rotational levels. Therefore, a complete description of the excitation mechanism in the CH ground state, observed towards individual sources entails observational constraints from the rotationally excited levels of CH and in particular that of its first rotationally excited state. Given the limited detections of these lines, the objective of this work is to characterise the physical and excitation properties of the rotationally excited lines of CH near 700 MHz, and investigate their influence on the pumping mechanisms of the ground-state lines of CH. This work presents the first interferometric search for the rotationally excited lines of CH near 700 MHz carried out using the uGMRT array and jointly models the physical and excitation conditions traced by lines from both the ground and first rotationally excited states of CH.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse continuum and molecular emission, observed with ALMA, from the dust-enshrouded intermediate-mass AGB star OH 30.1 -0.7. We find a secondary peak in the continuum maps, "feature B", separated by 4.6" from the AGB star, which corresponds to a projected separation of $1.8 \times 10^4$ au, placing a lower limit on the physical separation. This feature is most likely composed of cold dust and is likely to be ejecta associated with the AGB star, though we cannot rule out that it is a background object. The molecular emission we detect includes lines of CO, SiS, CS, SO$_2$, NS, NaCl, and KCl. We find that the NS emission is off centre and arranged along an axis perpendicular to the direction of feature B, indicative of a UV-emitting binary companion (e.g. a G-type main sequence star or hotter), perhaps on an eccentric orbit, contributing to its formation. However, the NaCl and KCl emission constrain the nature of that companion to not be hotter than a late B-type main sequence star. We find relatively warm emission arising from the inner wind and detect several vibrationally excited lines of SiS (3 = 1), NaCl (up to 3 = 4) and KCl (up to 3 = 2), and emission from low energy levels in the mid to outer envelope, as traced by SO$_2$. The CO emission is abruptly truncated around 3.5" or 14,000 au from the continuum peak, suggesting that mass loss at a high rate may have commenced as little as 2800 years ago.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of a changing-look blazar (CLB) on long timescales and expect to trace the state change of a CLB. Three morphological types, including a flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) state, transition state, and BL Lacertae (BL Lac) state are classified according to the criteria proposed by analyzing the relationship between the equivalent width of the emission line and the $\gamma$-ray photon spectral index $\Gamma_{\gamma}$. The multiwavelength light curves and spectral energy distributions corresponding to different epochs are obtained. The efforts found that $\Gamma_{\gamma}$ satisfy the relationships with $\Gamma_{\gamma} $ $\gtrsim$ 2.2 for the FSRQ state, $2.0 < \Gamma_{\gamma} < 2.2$ for the transition state, and $\Gamma_{\gamma}$ $\lesssim$ 2.0 for the BL Lac state. We apply the criteria to the photon spectrum evolution of CLB OQ 334 during MJD 58678 - 60387. The evolution is subdivided into five FSRQ states, nine transition states, and four BL Lac states. Moreover, we use the model spectra parameters of each state epoch to test the reliability of subdivided morphological types. The result shows that: (1) the accretion rate parameter is consistent with our earlier research; and (2) there is an increasing trend in the epochs of the BL Lac states, even if there is not an obvious decreasing trend in epochs of the FSRQ states. We issue that strong evidence that a CLB is an especial epoch in the evolution of blazars that could be obtained from the oscillation phenomenon in the CLB evolution.

 Circumstellar OH maser lines are useful for studying the dynamics of the circumstellar envelope (CSE) around evolved stars. This study aims to identify CSEs around cold stars bf, which exhibit deviations from the spherical expansion, by comparing the velocity ranges of the OH main lines (1665/1667 MHz) with those of the satellite line (1612 MHz), using a database of circumstellar OH maser sources. We performed this comparison for 377 circumstellar OH maser sources. In addition, using infrared two-color diagrams, we examined the evolutionary stages and infrared properties of objects showing velocity excess (velocity excess means the detection of the main lines outside the velocity range of the satellite line). A periodicity analysis of the WISE light curves was also carried out. As a result of the velocity range comparison, eight circumstellar OH maser sources were found to exhibit velocity excess. The infrared colors of these objects match those of post-AGB stars. Periodic variations were observed in the WISE light curves of five of these eight objects. The results suggest that examining velocity excess of the main lines relative to the satellite line is scientifically significant because mainline masers probe the CSE dynamics over a broader range of evolutionary stages compared to the 22.235 GHz H${_2}$O maser line. Additionally, during the post-AGB phase, the emission regions of the mainline and 22.235 GHz H${_2}$O masers may overlap in a CSE, whereas they originate from different regions during the AGB phase.

 We present a preliminary laboratory test of a setup designed to measure Hanbury Brown and Twiss-type intensity correlations from a chaotic light source using five spectral channels simultaneously. After averaging the zero-delay correlation peaks from all channels, we obtain an improvement of the signalto-noise ratio fairly consistent with theory. The goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of this technique to improve the sensitivity of stellar intensity interferometry using optical telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 Inertial waves in convective regions of stars exhibit topological properties linked to a Chern number of 1. The first of these is a unique, unidirectional, prograde oscillation mode within the cavity, which propagates at arbitrarily low frequencies for moderate azimuthal wavenumbers. The second one are phase singularities around which the phase winds in Fourier space, with winding numbers of $\pm 1$ depending on the hemisphere. Phase winding is a collective effect over waves propagating in all directions that is strongly robust to noise. This suggests a topology-based method for wave detection in noisy observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 M-dwarfs show frequent flares and associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) may significantly impact close-in habitable planets. M-dwarf flares sometimes show red/blue asymmetries in the H$\alpha$ line profile, suggesting prominence eruptions as an early stage of CMEs. However, their high-time-cadence observations are limited. We conducted spectroscopic monitoring observations of the active M-dwarf YZ Canis Minoris with $\sim$1 minute time cadence using the Seimei telescope, simultaneously with the optical photometric observations by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. We detected 27 H$\alpha$ flares with H$\alpha$ energies ranging from 1.7 $\times$ 10$^{29}$ to 3.8 $\times$ 10$^{32}$ erg and durations from 8 to 319 minutes. Among them, we identified 3 blue asymmetry and 5 red asymmetry events based on criteria using the Bayesian Information Criterion. The maximum velocity of the blue- and red-shifted components ranges from 250 to 450 km s$^{-1}$ and 190 to 400 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. The duration and time evolution show variety, and in particular, we discovered rapid, short-duration blue/red asymmetry events with the duration of 6--8 minutes. Among the 8 blue/red asymmetry events, two blue and one red asymmetry events are interpreted as prominence eruptions because of their fast velocity and time evolution. Based on this interpretation, the lower limit of occurrence frequency of prominence eruptions can be estimated to be $\sim$1.1 events per day. Our discovery of short-duration events suggests that previous studies with low time cadence may have missed these events, potentially leading to an underestimation of the occurrence frequency of prominence eruptions/CMEs.

          A dark energy parameterization independent constraint of the spatial curvature $\Omega_K$

 - **Abstract**
 Determining the spatial curvature $\Omega_K$ of the Universe has long been crucial in cosmology. In practice, this effort is often entangled with assumptions of dark energy. A combination of distance ($D_{\rm M}$, $D_{\rm L}$) and expansion rate ($H(z)$) measurements can break this degeneracy. However, fitting against discrete data points requires parameterizations of distance and expansion rate as functions of redshifts, which often induces cosmological model dependence. In this work, we propose a new dark energy model-independent parameterization of the cosmological comoving radial distance $\chi$. Fitting data combining distance ($D_{\rm M}$, $D_{\rm L}$) and Hubble parameter (or equivalently $D_H$) measurements, we are then able to obtain $\Omega_K$ in a dark energy model-independent manner. We test this parameterization and the associated fitting scheme with mock data generated with a wide range of fiducial dark energy equations of state ($-1.3<w<1.3$), finding that the best-fit $\Omega_K$ is always unbiased. Then we combine SDSS Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), and Observational Hubble Data (OHD) to constrain $\Omega_K$. We find a flat universe with $\Omega_K=-0.01\pm 0.09$. Most constraining power is contributed by SDSS BAO, with the BAO-alone constraint $\Omega_K=-0.03 \pm 0.10$. When replacing SDSS BAO with DESI year-one BAO measurement, we obtain $\Omega_K=0.06 \pm 0.08$. With the full DESI BAO data alone, we forecast $\sigma(\Omega_K)\sim 0.03$. Our result verifies the flatness of the universe free of dark energy modeling, and the proposed parameterization would be useful for future investigation of $\Omega_K$ and other parameters of interest, such as the horizon radius.

 - **Abstract**
 In astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs), neutrinos potentially experience substantial flavor mixing due to the refractive effects of neutrino self-interactions. Determining the survival probability of neutrinos in asymptotic states is paramount to incorporating flavor conversions' effects in the theoretical modeling of CCSN and BNSM. Some phenomenological schemes have shown good performance in approximating asymptotic states of fast neutrino-flavor conversions (FFCs), known as one of the collective neutrino oscillation modes induced by neutrino self-interactions. However, a recent study showed that they would yield qualitatively different asymptotic states of FFC if the neutrino number is forced to evolve. It is not yet fully understood why the canonical phenomenological models fail to predict asymptotic states. In this paper, we perform detailed investigations through numerical simulations and then provide an intuitive explanation with a quasi-homogeneous analysis. Based on the analysis, we propose a new phenomenological model, in which the quasi-steady evolution of FFCs is analytically determined. The model also allows us to express the convolution term of spatial wave number as a concise form, which corresponds to useful information on analyses for the non-linear feedback from small-scale flavor conversions to large-scale ones. Our model yields excellent agreement with numerical simulations, which lends support to our interpretation.

 In this paper we present three different applications, based on deep learning methodologies, that we are developing to support the scientific analysis conducted within the ASKAP-EMU and MeerKAT radio surveys. One employs instance segmentation frameworks to detect compact and extended radio sources and imaging artefacts from radio continuum images. Another application uses gradient boosting decision trees and convolutional neural networks to classify compact sources into different astronomical classes using combined radio and infrared multi-band images. Finally, we discuss how self-supervised learning can be used to obtain valuable radio data representations for source detection, and classification studies.

 The jet may compress an interstellar medium and soft X-ray may be absorbed outside the jet by a compressed interstellar medium and thermal emission heated by a shock is expected inside the jet. I analyze X-ray image of surroundings of the jet of M87 by Chandra. There is an original work for image analysis. In this time, I select data for image by removal of pile up event completely. I confirm a dip in soft X-ray outside the jet between knot E and knot F with 260 ks archival data. I analyze X-ray energy spectra for knot E and knot F with 400 ks archival data by Chandra in order to search for thermal emission. However, X-ray energy spectra for knot E and knot F are well described with synchrtron emission.

          The two alternative explosion mechanisms of core-collapse supernovae: 2024 status report

 - **Abstract**
 In comparing the two alternative explosion mechanisms of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), I examine recent three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations of CCSNe in the frame of the delayed-neutrino explosion mechanism (neutrino mechanism) and argue that these valuable simulations show that neutrino heating can supply a non-negligible fraction of the explosion energy but not the observed energies, hence cannot be the primary explosion mechanism. In addition to the energy crisis, the neutrino mechanism predicts many failed supernovae that are not observed. The most challenging issue of the neutrino mechanism is that it cannot account for point-symmetric morphologies of CCSN remnants, many of which were identified in 2024. These contradictions with observations imply that the neutrino mechanism cannot be the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe. The alternative jittering-jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) seems to be the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe; neutrino heating boosts the energy of the jittering jets. Even if some simulations show explosions of stellar models (but usually with energies below observed), it does not mean that the neutrino mechanism is the explosion mechanism. Jittering jets, which simulations do not include, can explode the core before the neutrino heating process does. Morphological signatures of jets in many CCSN remnants suggest that jittering jets are the primary driving mechanism, as expected by the JJEM.

          The overconcentrated dark halo in the strong lens SDSS J0946+1006 is a subhalo: evidence for self interacting dark matter?

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of dark matter is poorly constrained on subgalactic scales. Alternative models to cold dark matter, such as warm dark matter or self-interacting dark matter, could produce very different dark haloes on these scales. One of the few known dark haloes smaller than a galaxy was discovered in the triple source plane strong lens system J0946+1006. Previous studies have found that this structure is much more concentrated than expected in $\Lambda$CDM, but have assumed the dark halo is at the same redshift as the main deflector ($z_{\rm main}=0.222$). In this paper, we fit for the redshift of this dark halo. We reconstruct the first two sources in the system using a forward modelling approach, allowing for additional complexity from multipole perturbations. We find that the perturber redshift is $z_{\rm halo} = {0.207}^{+0.019}_{-0.019}$, and lower bounds on the evidence strongly prefer a subhalo over a line-of-sight structure. Whilst modelling both background sources does not improve constraints on the redshift of the subhalo, it breaks important degeneracies affecting the reconstruction of multipole perturbations. We find that the subhalo is a more than $5\sigma$ outlier from the $\Lambda$CDM $v_{\rm max}$-$r_{\rm max}$ relation and has a steep profile with an average slope of $\gamma_{\rm 2D} = {-1.81}^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$ for radii between $0.75-1.25$ kpc. This steep slope might indicate dark matter self-interactions causing the subhalo to undergo gravothermal collapse; such collapsed haloes are expected to have $\gamma_{\rm 2D} \approx -2$.

          Globally Stable Dark Energy in F(R) Gravity

 - **Abstract**
 $F(R)$ models for dark energy generally exhibit a weak curvature singularity, which can be cured by adding an $R^2$ term. This correction allows for a unified description of primordial and late-time accelerated expansions. However, most existing models struggle to achieve this, as they become unstable over certain negative ranges of the Ricci scalar, where either the first or second derivative of $F(R)$ turns negative. These instabilities may disrupt the post-inflationary evolution when the Ricci scalar oscillates about the vacuum state after the $R^2$ inflation. In this work, we introduce a new model-building to guarantee global stability, i.e., the first and second derivatives are positive for all real Ricci scalars. By extending the idea from Appleby and Battye, we demonstrate that viable models can be constructed by imposing a positive, bounded first derivative of $F(R)$ with a sigmoid shape. As examples, we first reformulate and generalize the original Appleby-Battye model. Then, we propose a new dark energy model, which successfully explains the acceleration of cosmic expansion and passes local gravity tests.

 - **Abstract**
 New insights from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data, in conjunction with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) data, suggest that dark energy may not be a cosmological constant. In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of holographic dark energy (HDE) and interacting holographic dark energy (IHDE) models, utilizing CMB, DESI BAO, and SN data. By considering the combined DESI BAO and SN data, we determine that in the IHDE model, the parameter $c > 1$ and the dark-energy equation of state $w$ does not cross $-1$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level, whereas in the HDE model, it marginally falls below this threshold. Upon incorporating CMB data, we observe that in the HDE model, the parameter $c < 1$ and $w$ crosses $-1$ at a level beyond $10\sigma$. Conversely, for the IHDE model, the likelihood of $w$ crossing $-1$ is considerably diminished, implying that the introduction of interaction within the HDE model could potentially resolve or mitigate the cosmic big rip conundrum. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the HDE and IHDE models are statistically as viable as the $\Lambda$CDM model when assessing Bayesian evidence with DESI BAO data combined with SN data. However, when CMB data are added, the HDE and IHDE models are significantly less favored compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our findings advocate for further exploration of the HDE and IHDE models using forthcoming, more precise late-universe observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactica simulation database is a platform designed to assist computational astrophysicists with their open science approach based on FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. It offers the means to publish their numerical simulation projects, whatever their field of application or research theme and provides access to reduced datasets and object catalogs online. The application implements the Simulation Datamodel IVOA standard. To provide the scientific community indirect access to raw simulation data, Galactica can generate, on an "on-demand" basis, custom high-level data products to meet specific user requirements. These data products, accessible through online WebServices, are produced remotely from the raw simulation datasets. To that end, the Galactica central web application communicates with a high-scalability ecosystem of data-processing servers called Terminus by means of an industry-proven asynchronous task management system. Each Terminus node, hosted in a research institute, a regional or national supercomputing facility, contributes to the ecosystem by providing both the storage and the computational resources required to store the massive simulation datasets and post-process them to create the data products requested on Galactica, hence guaranteeing fine-grained sovereignty over data and resources. This distributed architecture is very versatile, it can be interfaced with any kind of data-processing software, written in any language, handling raw data produced by every type of simulation code used in the field of computational astrophysics. Its generality and versatility, together with its excellent scalability makes it a powerful tool for the scientific community to disseminate numerical models in astrophysics in the exascale era.

 - **Abstract**
 By observing binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to the edge of the Universe, next-generation (XG) ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors like Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope will map the BBH merger rate across all of cosmic history. This merger rate traces the formation rate of their progenitor stars convolved with a delay time distribution. Given theoretically-motivated priors on the delay time distribution, we show how XG observations can measure the BBH progenitor formation rate, probing the star formation rate (SFR) up to $z > 15$. However, the progenitor formation rate does not directly give a measurement of the SFR, but rather a combination of the SFR and its metallicity distribution as a function of redshift. Fortunately, the metallicity-dependence of BBH formation likely varies as a function of BBH mass and/or formation channel. We find that if different BBH subpopulations with distinct metallicity biases can be identified, comparing their rates as a function of redshift yields a simultaneous measurement of the SFR and its metallicity distribution. Given optimistic theoretical priors and one year of observation, this may provide a $\sim10\%$ measurement of the SFR at its peak and a 0.2 dex (0.7 dex) measurement of the median metallicity out to $z = 10$ ($z = 15$) at 90\% credibility, although the uncertainties scale with theoretical uncertainties on BBH delay times and formation efficiencies.

 - **Abstract**
 The multiple impact hypothesis proposes that the Moon formed through a series of smaller collisions, rather than a single giant impact. This study advances our understanding of this hypothesis, as well as moon collisions in other contexts, by exploring the implications of these smaller impacts, employing a novel methodological approach that combines self-consistent initial conditions, hybrid hydrodynamic/N-body simulations, and the incorporation of material strength. Our findings challenge the conventional assumption of perfect mergers in previous models, revealing a spectrum of collision outcomes including partial accretion and mass loss. These outcomes are sensitive to collision parameters and Earth's tidal influence, underscoring the complex dynamics of lunar accretion. Importantly, we demonstrate that incorporating material strength is important for accurately simulating moonlet-sized impacts. This inclusion significantly affects fragmentation, tidal disruption, and the amount of material ejected or accreted onto Earth, ultimately impacting the Moon's growth trajectory. By accurately modeling diverse collision outcomes, our hybrid approach provides a powerful new framework for understanding the Moon's formation. We show that most collisions (~90%) do not significantly erode the largest moonlet, supporting the feasibility of lunar growth through accretion. Moreover, we revise previous estimates of satellite disruption, suggesting a higher survival rate and further bolstering the multiple-impact scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 The rovibrational level populations, and subsequent emission in various astrophysical environments, is driven by inelastic collision processes. The available rovibrational rate coefficients for water have been calculated using a number of approximations. We present a numerically exact calculation for the rovibrational quenching for all water vibrational modes due to collisions with atomic hydrogen. The scattering theory implements a quantum close-coupling (CC) method on a high level ab initio six-dimensional (6D) potential energy surface (PES). Total rovibrational quenching cross sections for excited bending levels were compared with earlier results on a 4D PES with the rigid-bender close-coupling (RBCC) approximation. General agreement between 6D-CC and 4D-RBCC calculations are found, but differences are evident including the energy and amplitude of low-energy orbiting resonances. Quenching cross sections from the symmetric and asymmetric stretch modes are provided for the first time. The current 6D-CC calculation provides accurate inelastic data needed for astrophysical modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 We have developed a new regression technique, the maximum likelihood (ML)-based method and its variant, the KS-test based method, designed to obtain unbiased regression results from typical astronomical data. A normalizing flow model is employed to automatically estimate the unobservable intrinsic distribution of the independent variable as well as the unobservable correlation between uncertainty level and intrinsic value of both independent and dependent variables from the observed data points in a variational inference based empirical Bayes approach. By incorporating these estimated distributions, our method comprehensively accounts for the uncertainties associated with both independent and dependent variables. Our test on both mock data and real astronomical data from PHANGS-ALMA and PHANGS-JWST demonstrates that both the ML based method and the KS-test based method significantly outperform the existing widely-used methods, particularly in cases of low signal-to-noise ratios. The KS-test based method exhibits remarkable robustness against deviations from underlying assumptions, complex intrinsic distributions, varying correlations between uncertainty levels and intrinsic values, inaccuracies in uncertainty estimations, outliers, and saturation effects. We recommend the KS-test based method as the preferred choice for general applications, while the ML based method is suggested for small samples with sizes of $N < 100$. A GPU-compatible Python implementation of our methods, nicknamed ``raddest'', will be made publicly available upon acceptance of this paper.

 - **Abstract**
 Super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass compact objects powers fast outflows in Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). Such outflows, which can reach mildly relativistic velocities, are often observed forming bubble structures. Wind bubbles are expected to develop strong wind termination shocks, sites of great interest for diffusive shock acceleration. We develop a model of diffusive shock acceleration in the wind bubbles powered by ULXs. We find that the maximum energy in these objects can easily reach the PeV range, promoting ULX winds as a new class of PeVatrons. We specialize our model in the context of the Galactic source SS 433 and show that high-energy protons in the bubble might explain the highest energy photons (>100 TeV) and their morphology recently observed by LHAASO. We discuss the detectability of such a source in neutrinos and we analyze the possible radio counterpart of ULXs focusing on the case of W50, the nebula surrounding SS 433. We finally discuss the possible contribution of Galactic ULXs to the cosmic-ray flux at the knee concluding that their role might be substantial.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun's chromosphere is a critical region to understand when considering energy and mass deposition into the transition region and corona, but many of the smaller, faster events which transport a portion of this mass and energy are still difficult to observe, identify and model. Solar Spicules are small, spike-like events in the solar chromosphere that have the potential to transfer energy and mass to the transition region, but whose energetic origins are still being researched. Chromospheric spicule activity on-disk can be identified by observing temporary excursions in the red and blue wings of chromospheric emission lines. Researchers have demonstrated this in Hydrogen~Alpha (H{\alpha}, 6563 Å), Ca II (8542 Å, k 3934 Å), Mg II (h 2803 Å, k 2796 Å), and Si IV (1394 Å, 1405 Å) spectral observations, with the vast majority of identification efforts focused on lower chromospheric observations of H$\alpha$ and Ca II. Because any spicules which deposit mass and energy into the transition region must necessarily pass through the upper chromosphere, observations from this region such as Mg II or Hydrogen Lyman Alpha (Ly$\alpha$ 1216 Å) in enough quantity to perform proper statistics will be critical to fully characterizing spicules' impact on mass and energy transfer in the Sun. This research proposes a definition with numerical limits for how spicules appear in Mg II wavelengths, tunes an algorithm for automatically detecting spicules in Mg II spectral observations, and uses K Means Clustering to identify and display the full range of spicule spectrum shapes. This work will help allow statistical studies on spicules in the upper chromosphere to be as thorough as those of the lower chromosphere, allowing researchers to better understand the physical nature of spicules and their role in energy transfer and deposition in the solar atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Rotational irregularities are one of the prominent observational features that most pulsars exhibit. These glitches, which are sudden increases in spin angular velocity, remains an open problem. In this study, we have investigated the potential role of nontrivial topological defects, specifically in the form of Nambu-goto-type CSs, and its connection to spin irregularities. Such CSs which are one-dimensional topological defects may be formed during various symmetry-breaking and phase transition scenarios and can interact with the neutron stars. In this work, we see that the appearance of such topological defects trapped within the core can lead to the coupling of the string tension with the angular velocity, leading to the abrupt rotational changes observed as pulsar glitches. We have further studied how these coupling may generate detectable gravitational waves as a mixture of continuous and burst signals. The evolution of cusps of CSs trapped within neutron stars and the neutron star's mass quadruple moment change due to rotation could produce distinctive gravitational wave signatures, well within the noise cutoff of advLIGO. Our study highlights a potential connection between topological defects, pulsar glitches, and gravitational wave emissions, offering a possible avenue for observationally testing the presence of CSs and their astrophysical effects.

 Context. Small bodies in Earth-like orbits, the Arjunas, are good targets for scientific exploration and mining studies as they enable low-cost missions. The subset of such objects that experience recurrent temporarily captured flyby or orbiter events, also called mini-moon episodes, are among the best ranked in terms of accessibility. Only a handful of objects are known to have engaged in such a dynamical behavior. Finding and characterizing more of them may help to expand scientific and commercial research activities in space over the next few decades. Asteroid 2024 PT5 was found recently and belongs to this group of interesting objects. Aims. Here, we investigate the orbital context of 2024 PT5, and its spectral and rotational properties. Methods. We studied the short-term orbital evolution of 2024 PT5 using direct N-body simulations. We identified its spectral class from the visible reflectance spectrum and used photometric observations to derive its rotational properties. Observational data were obtained with the OSIRIS camera spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope. Results. Asteroid 2024 PT5 experiences recurrent co-orbital engagements and mini-moon events of the temporarily captured flyby type. Its visible spectrum is consistent with that of an Sv-type asteroid or perhaps lunar ejecta. Its rotational period could be less than or close to 1 h. Conclusions. The discovery of 2024 PT5 confirms that temporarily captured flybys are relatively frequent and involve objects larger than a few meters, suitable as accessible targets for scientific research activities and commercial mining ventures in space.

 We report the discovery of a close binary J0606+2132 (Gaia DR3 3423365496448406272) with $P_{\rm obs}=2.77$ days containing a possible massive white dwarf or a neutron star using the LAMOST spectroscopic data. By a joint fitting of the radial velocity from LAMOST and the light curve from TESS, we derived a circular Keplerian orbit with an inclination of $i=$81.31$^{\circ}$$^{+6.26^{\circ}}_{-7.85^{\circ}}$, which is consistent with that derived from $v{\rm sin}I$. Together with the mass of the visible star, we derived the mass of the invisible object to be 1.34$^{+0.35}_{-0.40} M_{\odot}$. Spectral disentangling with the LAMOST medium-resolution spectra shows no absorption feature from an additional component, suggesting the presence of a compact object. No X-ray or radio pulsed signal is detected from ROSAT and FAST archive observations. J0606+2132 could evolve into either a Type Ia supernova or a neutron star through accretion-induced collapse if it is a white dwarf, or into an intermediate-mass X-ray binary if it is a neutron star.

 - **Abstract**
 While machine-learned models are now routinely employed to facilitate astronomical inquiry, model inputs tend to be limited to a primary data source (namely images or time series) and, in the more advanced approaches, some metadata. Yet with the growing use of wide-field, multiplexed observational resources, individual sources of interest often have a broad range of observational modes available. Here we construct an astronomical multimodal dataset and propose AstroM$^3$, a self-supervised pre-training approach that enables a model to learn from multiple modalities simultaneously. Specifically, we extend the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model to a trimodal setting, allowing the integration of time-series photometry data, spectra, and astrophysical metadata. In a fine-tuning supervised setting, our results demonstrate that CLIP pre-training improves classification performance for time-series photometry, where accuracy increases from 84.6% to 91.5%. Furthermore, CLIP boosts classification accuracy by up to 12.6% when the availability of labeled data is limited, showing the effectiveness of leveraging larger corpora of unlabeled data. In addition to fine-tuned classification, we can use the trained model in other downstream tasks that are not explicitly contemplated during the construction of the self-supervised model. In particular we show the efficacy of using the learned embeddings for misclassifications identification, similarity search, and anomaly detection. One surprising highlight is the "rediscovery" of Mira subtypes and two Rotational variable subclasses using manifold learning and dimension reduction algorithm. To our knowledge this is the first construction of an $n>2$ mode model in astronomy. Extensions to $n>3$ modes is naturally anticipated with this approach.

          Stochastic inflation and non-perturbative power spectrum beyond slow roll

 - **Abstract**
 Stochastic inflation, together with the $\Delta N$ formalism, provides a powerful tool for estimating the large-scale behaviour of primordial fluctuations. We construct a numerical code to capture the non-perturbative statistics of such fluctuations and test our code to obtain the exponential non-Gaussian tail of the curvature perturbations. We provide a numerical algorithm to compute the non-perturbative curvature power spectrum and apply it to slow-roll (SR) and ultra-slow-roll (USR) single-field models of inflation. For the USR case, we successfully reproduce the peak in the power spectrum, which agrees to a certain accuracy with the perturbative power spectrum. We highlight some important differences between non-perturbative and perturbative approaches that may suggest the inconsistency of the $\Delta N$ formalism at the transition stages between attractor and non-attractor regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents the GRBSN webtool, a public facing application which hosts the most complete list of GRB-SN associations to date. In contrast to other repositories of supernova or gamma-ray burst data, this tool brings together all of the information required to study a GRB-SN association. GRBSN allows users to view and interact with plots of the data; search and filter the whole database; and download all multi-wavelength data related to a GRB-SN association, including radio, X-ray, optical/NIR photometric and spectroscopic data. The tool is fully open source and is hosted on a public GitHub repository, meaning users can upload their own data, flag missing data and suggest improvements. As the number of confirmed GRB-SN associations increases, the webtool will provide a robust framework in which to catalogue these associations and their associated data. The web application is freely available and publicly accessible at this https URL.
