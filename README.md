 - **Abstract**
 The X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) is the 7th Japanese X-ray observatory, whose development and operation are in collaboration with universities and research institutes in Japan, U.S., and Europe, including JAXA, NASA, and ESA. The telemetry data downlinked from the satellite are reduced to scientific products by the pre-pipeline (PPL) and pipeline (PL) software running on standard Linux virtual machines on the JAXA and NASA sides, respectively. We ported the PPL to the JAXA "TOKI-RURI" high-performance computing (HPC) system capable of completing $\simeq 160$ PPL processes within 24 hours by utilizing the container platform of Singularity and its "--bind" option. In this paper, we briefly show the data processing in XRISM and present our porting strategy of PPL to the HPC environment in detail.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST) at Gemini South started regular queue operations in early 2024, bringing a long-sought open-access capability to the astronomy community. This research note briefly describes an effort to provide easy-to-access reduced spectra for GHOST programs from all Gemini partner countries and encourage prompt data exploration and analysis. Since March 2024, over 4500 spectra have been reduced and made available to principal investigators (PIs). The aim is to increase demand for GHOST and expedite the publication of scientific results.

 - **Abstract**
 The Neptune desert is no longer empty. A handful of close-in planets with masses between those of Neptune and Saturn have now been discovered, and their puzzling properties have inspired a number of interesting theories on the formation and evolution of desert-dwellers. While some studies suggest that Neptune desert planets form and evolve similarly to longer-period Neptunes, others argue that they are products of rare collisions between smaller planets, or that they are the exposed interiors of giant planets (i.e., ``hot Jupiters gone wrong''). These origin stories make different predictions for the metallicities of Neptune desert host stars. In this paper, we use the homogeneous catalog of stellar metallicities from Gaia Data Release 3 to investigate the origins of Neptune desert-dwellers. We find that planets in the Neptune desert orbit stars that are significantly more metal-rich than the hosts of longer-period Neptunes ($p = 0.0016$) and smaller planets ($p = 0.00014$). In contrast, Neptune desert host star metallicities are statistically indistinguishable from those of hot Jupiter host stars ($p = 0.55$). Therefore, we find it relatively unlikely that Neptune desert planets formed and evolved similarly to longer-period Neptunes, or that they resulted from collisions between smaller planets, at least without another metallicity-selective process involved. A more straightforward explanation for this result is that planets in the desert truly are the exposed interiors of larger planets. Atmospheric spectroscopy of Neptune desert worlds may therefore provide a rare glimpse into the interiors of giant exoplanets.

          Non-Gaussianity from explicit $U(1)$-breaking interactions

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate primordial non-Gaussianity (NG) arising from the explicit $U(1)$ symmetry-breaking interactions during inflation involving a nearly massless axial component of a complex scalar field $P$. We analyze the induced NG parameter $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ under scenarios where the axial field functions as either a curvaton or cold dark matter (CDM). In the curvaton framework, there is a conventional contribution to the local NG of $f_{\rm NL} \simeq -O(1)$. Additional positive local NG can result from either the self-interactions of axial field fluctuations, their interactions with a light radial partner, or kinetic mixing with the inflaton via $U(1)$ symmetry-breaking terms. We identify parameter regions where the interactions lead to cancellations, suppressing the overall local NG to $|f^{\rm loc}_{\mathrm{NL}}| \lesssim O(0.1)$, while leaving the trispectrum largely unaffected. In the CDM scenario, these interactions enhance the NG in the isocurvature fluctuations. Moreover, interactions between the axial field and another light scalar, such as a curvaton, can generate $O(1)$ curvature NG signals and significant mixed curvature-isocurvature NGs that are within the reach of future experiments with $\sigma(f^{\rm loc}_{\rm NL})\sim1$. We also explore the role of a heavy radial field in generating oscillating correlation signals, noting that such signals can dominate the shape of the mixed adiabatic-isocurvature bispectrum. In certain cases, an oscillatory isocurvature bispectrum signal may be observable in the future, aiding in distinguishing between certain types of the $U(1)$-breaking self-interactions of the axial field.

          Quantifying spectroscopic Ca II exocomet transit occurrence in two decades of HARPS data

 - **Abstract**
 The field of exocomets has been built around the unmatched number of detections made in the circumstellar disc of the archetypal star Beta Pictoris. An exocomet detection in spectroscopy is identified by variable atomic absorption features in a stellar spectrum, associated with transiting gas in and trailing an exocomet coma. This paper presents the largest spectroscopic search for exocomet transits to date, which overcomes the limitations of biased samples of stars with debris discs, and instead looks through the $\approx$7500 stars in the HARPS archive for signs of exocomets in the CaII doublet (H:396.847nm and K:393.366nm). The search resulted in 155 candidate stars, which after filtering for false positives (e.g. binaries, stellar activity, etc.), were cut down to 22 stars. These 22 stars are classified into Tier1, 2, and 3 exocomet candidates, reflecting the confidence level of their exocomet detection. Our two best candidates (Tier1: Beta Pictoris, HD172555) and four lower confidence candidates (Tier2: Gl1, HIP5158, HD94771, HR1996) are discussed, yielding a detection rate of 0.03% (Tier1 only) and 0.1% (Tier1 & 2) in the HARPS sample. Both Tier1 stars are known exocomet host stars. These two young A-type stars correspond to 0.4% of all A-types in the sample, suggesting that detecting signs of exocomet transits using CaII is more likely around young A-type stars. Reanalysing a past HARPS study, we found no evidence to support the previously claimed four exocomet detections, indicating either that those detections are not robust or that we are only sensitive to the strongest signals.

          Revisiting the Suzaku spectrum of the Galactic SNR W 49 B: non-detection of iron K-shell charge exchange emission and refined ejecta mass ratios of iron-group elements

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the recombining plasma in several Galactic SNRs has been debated. A plausible mechanism would be a rapid cooling in the past, either by adiabatic or conductive process. A recent spectral study of W 49 B reported a possible charge exchange (CX) emission due to collisions between the shock-heated ejecta and external cold clouds, which could be a direct support for the conduction cooling scenario. However, a potentially large systematic uncertainty in the spectral analysis has not been examined. In this paper, we revisit the Suzaku spectrum of W 49 B with taking into account the systematic uncertainties in spectral codes and instrumental gain calibration. We find that the previously reported CX flux is fully attributable to dielectronic recombination satellite lines of high-shell transitions that are missing from the present version of the spectral codes. We also report refined Fe-group ejecta mass ratios, which, in comparison to those in the literatures, show a better agreement with theoretical expectations from nucleosynthesis models, either of Type Ia explosions or spherical core-collapse explosions.

          Accurate absolute photometric calibration by fitting the system transmission

 - **Abstract**
 Transforming the instrumental photometry of ground-based telescopes into a calibrated physical flux in a well-defined passband is a major challenge in astronomy. Along with the intrinsic instrumental difference between telescopes sharing the same filter, the effective transmission is continuously modified by the effects of the variable atmosphere of the Earth. We have developed a new approach to the absolute photometric calibration that simultaneously treats instrumental and atmospheric effects on an image-by-image basis by fitting the system transmission. This approach aims at breaking the 1% absolute photometric accuracy which limits current calibration methods for ground-based observatories. We fit the transmission, as a function of wavelength, for each image. The fit is done by comparing the instrumental fluxes of stars in the image to the synthetic photometry of the stars given their spectrum and the transmission function which have free parameters. A key element that enables this approach is the set of about 220 million low-resolution spectra measured by Gaia, which provides a large number of stellar calibrators in the image. We demonstrate the method using data from the Large Array Survey Telescope (LAST). We show that the residuals between observations and synthetic photometry of the Gaia spectra in the fitted transmission have a standard deviation $<$1% on an image-by-image basis, with no spatial and color dependencies. The median accuracy of the zero-point throughout the image is between 3-5 mmag, depending on the total image exposure. Furthermore we show that this method provides high stability over long temporal scales.

          Polarized multiwavelength emission from pulsar wind - accretion disk interaction in a transitional millisecond pulsar

 - **Abstract**
 Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) bridge the evolutionary gap between accreting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries and millisecond radio pulsars. These systems exhibit a unique subluminous X-ray state characterized by the presence of an accretion disk and rapid switches between high and low X-ray emission modes. The high mode features coherent millisecond pulsations spanning from the X-ray to the optical band. We present multiwavelength polarimetric observations of the tMSP PSR J1023+0038 aimed at conclusively identifying the physical mechanism powering its emission in the subluminous X-ray state. During the high mode, we detect polarized emission in the 2-6 keV energy range, with a polarization degree of 12% +/- 3% and a polarization angle of -2deg +/- 9deg (1sigma) measured counterclockwise from the North celestial pole towards East. At optical wavelengths, we find a polarization degree of 1.41% +/- 0.04% and a polarization angle aligned with that in the soft X-rays, suggesting a common physical mechanism operating across these bands. Remarkably, the polarized flux spectrum matches the pulsed emission spectrum from optical to X-rays. The polarization properties differ markedly from those observed in other accreting neutron stars and isolated rotation-powered pulsars and are also inconsistent with an origin in a compact jet. Our results provide direct evidence that the polarized and pulsed emissions both originate from synchrotron radiation at the shock formed where the pulsar wind interacts with the inner regions of the accretion disk.

          On the maximum disk heating attributable to fuzzy dark matter

 - **Abstract**
 Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) granulations would drive orbital transport of stars in galactic disks, and in particular would produce roughly equal amounts of radial heating and radial migration. However, observations suggest that heating has been much less efficient than migration in our Galaxy. We argue that this decreases the amount of radial heating, $\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{FDM}$, that can safely be attributed to FDM. Consequently, lower bounds on the FDM particle mass $m$ derived through Galactic disk kinematics should be revised upwards; a rough estimate is $m \gtrsim 1.3\times 10^{-22} \mathrm{eV} \times [(\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{FDM}/\mathcal{H})/0.1]^{-1/2}$, where $\mathcal{H}$ is the total observed radial heating.

          Evolution of orbits of trans-Neptunian bodies at the 2:3 resonance with Neptune

 - **Abstract**
 The results of the numerical investigations of the evolution of orbits of trans-Neptunian bodies at the 2 : 3 resonance with Neptune are presented. The gravitational influence of the four giant planets was taken into account. For identical initial values of the semimajor axes, eccentricities, and inclinations, but for different initial orbital orientations and initial positions in orbits, we obtained different types of variations in the difference {\Delta}{\Omega}={\Omega}-{\Omega}_N in the ascending-node longitudes of the body and Neptune, and in the perihelion argument {\omega}. When {\Delta}{\Omega} decreases and {\omega} increases during evolution, then most of the bodies leave the resonance in 20 Myr. In the case of an increase in {\Delta}{\Omega} and a decrease in {\omega}, the bodies stay in the resonance for a much longer time. Regions of eccentricities and inclinations, for which some bodies were in the {\eta}_18 secular resonance ({\Delta}{\Omega} is almost constant) and in the Kozai resonance ({\omega} is almost constant), were obtained to be larger than those predicted for small variations in the critical angle. Some bodies can at the same time be in both these resonances.

          Fermion-Boson Stars as Attractors in Fuzzy Dark Matter and Ideal Gas Dynamics

 - **Abstract**
 In the context of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) we study the core formation in the presence of an Ideal Gas (IG). Our analysis is based on the solution of the Schrödinger-Poisson-Euler system of equations that drives the evolution of FDM together with a compressible IG, both coupled through the gravitational potential they produce. Starting from random initial conditions for both FDM and IG, with dominant FDM, we study the evolution of the system until it forms a nearly relaxed, virialized and close to hydrostatic equilibrium core, surrounded by an envelope of the two components. We find that the core corresponds to Newtonian Fermion-Boson Stars (FBS). If the IG is used to model luminous matter, our results indicate that FBS behave as attractor core solutions of structure formation of FDM along with baryonic matter.

          AutoKnots: Adaptive Knot Allocation for Spline Interpolation

 - **Abstract**
 In astrophysical and cosmological analyses, the increasing quality and volume of astronomical data demand efficient and precise computational tools. This work introduces a novel adaptive algorithm for automatic knots (AutoKnots) allocation in spline interpolation, designed to meet user-defined precision requirements. Unlike traditional methods that rely on manually configured knot distributions with numerous parameters, the proposed technique automatically determines the optimal number and placement of knots based on interpolation error criteria. This simplifies configuration, often requiring only a single parameter. The algorithm progressively improves the interpolation by adaptively sampling the function-to-be-approximated, $f(x)$, in regions where the interpolation error exceeds the desired threshold. All function evaluations contribute directly to the final approximation, ensuring efficiency. While each resampling step involves recomputing the interpolation table, this process is highly optimized and usually computationally negligible compared to the cost of evaluating $f(x)$. We show the algorithm's efficacy through a series of precision tests on different functions. However, the study underscores the necessity for caution when dealing with certain function types, notably those featuring plateaus. To address this challenge, a heuristic enhancement is incorporated, improving accuracy in flat regions. This algorithm has been extensively used and tested over the years. NumCosmo includes a comprehensive set of unit tests that rigorously evaluate the algorithm both directly and indirectly, underscoring its robustness and reliability. As a practical application, we compute the surface mass density $\Sigma(R)$ and the average surface mass density $\overline{\Sigma}(<R)$ for Navarro-Frenk-White and Hernquist halo density profiles, which provide analytical benchmarks.

          Ubiquitous Small-scale EUV Upflow-Like Events above Network Regions Observed by the Solar Orbiter/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager

 - **Abstract**
 Universal small-scale solar activity in quiet region are suggested to be a potential source of solar wind and the upper solar atmosphere. Here, with the high-resoltion 174 Å~imaging observations from the Solar Orbiter/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI), we investigate 59 EUV upflow-like events observed in the quiet Sun. Their average apparent (plane-of-sky) velocity, lifetime, and propagation distance are measured as 62 $\speed$, 68.6 s and 3.94 Mm, respectively. These upflow-like events exhibit dynamic characteristics but lack base brightening, featuring a hot front and subsequent cold plasma ejection. 39\% of the EUV upflow-like events exhibit recurrent characteristics. Unprecedented high-resolution 174 Å~observations reveal that some EUV upflow-like events exhibit blob-like fine structures and multi-strand evolutionary features, and some upflow-like events can cause localized haze-like plasma heating ahead of their spire region during the ejection process. A subset of the EUV upflow-like events covered by the Solar Dynamics Observatory reveals that they appear at the chromospheric networks. Through emission measure analysis, we found that these upflow-like events eject hot plasma of transient region or coronal temperature (an average of $\sim$10$^{5.5}$K). We suggest that EUV upflow-like events may be EUV counterparts of chromospheric spicules and/or transition region network jets, and play a role in heating localized corona above the network regions.

          Streaming Torque with Turbulent Diffusion

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/

 - **Abstract**
 Fast type-I migration of (proto)planets poses a challenging problem for the core accretion formation scenario. We found that the dust-induced ``Streaming Torque (ST)'' may slow down or even reverse the planet migration in \cite{Hou2024}. But in realistic protoplanetary disks, dust diffusion induced by gas turbulence may have important influences on ST. We perform linear analysis to investigate the effects of dust diffusion on ST. The dependence of ST on the dust diffusion may provide better constraints on the turbulence strength and the stopping time $\tau$. We derive the dispersion relation for all the wave modes in the two-fluid system. The dust diffusion will smooth the short-wavelength structure of the the quasi-drift mode and split it into two predominant D-drift modes with opposite directions. The outgoing D-drift mode will contribute to a negative torque on planets, particularly when $\tau \sim 0.1$, which slightly shifts the zero-torque turning point. We explore how ST depends on the regimes of aerodynamic drag, dust mass fraction and disk scale height. We compare the radial wavenumbers of D-drift modes under different formulations of dust diffusion and find qualitative agreement. In all cases, $\tau$ at the zero-torque turning point, which determines the direction of planetary migration, consistently remains on the order of $\sim 0.1$, corresponding to large pebble-sized dust grains. This suggests that rapid dust coagulation can inhibit the inward migration of planets, implying that weak gas turbulence may enhance the survival of protoplanets.

 The increasing population of objects in geostationary orbit has raised concerns about the potential risks posed by debris clouds resulting from fragmentation. The short-term evolution and associated hazards of debris generated by collisions in the geostationary region is investigated in this study. The initial distribution of two debris clouds is modeled using a single probability density this http URL combined distribution of the evolved clouds is determined by solving boundary value this http URL risks associated with these debris clouds are evaluated by calculating the instantaneous impact rate and cumulative collision this http URL probability of collisions with millimeter-sized fragments may increase to 1% within 36 hours, while the probability of collisions with fragments 5 cm or larger is approximately $10^{-5}$.These findings underscore the vulnerability of the geostationary region to space traffic accidents.

 - **Abstract**
 Many recent studies have pointed out significant discrepancies between observations and models of stellar populations in the near-infrared (NIR). With current and future observing facilities being focused in this wavelength range, properly assessing and solving these issues is of utmost importance. Here, we present the first application of the extragalactic globular cluster (GC) near-infrared spectroscopy survey, and present evidence that these GCs reveal an age zero-point problem of stellar population synthesis (SPS) models. This problem has already been identified in the optical range for the GCs of the Milky Way. Such an issue arises when derived GC spectroscopic ages appear older than the Universe itself. We extend this discussion for the first time to the NIR, specifically using the Pa$_{\rm\beta}$ line at 1.28~microns. We focus on the GCs of the nearby Centaurus~A galaxy using their NIR spectra. This work broadens our understanding of the age zero-point problem and emphasises the necessity to revisit and refine SPS models, especially in the NIR domain.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the existence and properties of open superclusters within 500 pc of the Sun, with a particular focus on a newly identified OSC, designated HC8. Utilizing Gaia-derived advanced astrometric data and star cluster catalogs, we identify and analyze the member stars of various open clusters (OCs), deriving key parameters such as ages, distances, extinctions, and kinematic properties. Our findings reveal that HC8, a previously unrecognized OSC, encompasses several young clusters, including the newly discovered OC Duvia 1. We provide a detailed examination of HC8's star formation history and its spatial and kinematic characteristics. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the existence of primordial groups and enhances our understanding of the formation and evolution of star clusters in the Galaxy.

          The Mira discovery problem - Observations by David Fabricius in 1596 and 1609 (and by others before?): Positional accuracy, brightness, color index, and period

 - **Abstract**
 The pulsating variable star Mira (omikron Ceti) was observed by David Fabricius (Frisia) in 1596 and 1609. We review suggested previous detections (e.g. China, Hipparchos). We analyze all Mira records from Fabricius in their historical context. Fabricius measured the separation of Mira to other stars to \pm 1.6-1.7'. From his texts, we derive a brightness (slightly brighter than Hamal) of ca. 1.9 \pm 0.1 mag and a color index B-V \simeq 1.3-1.4 mag (`like Mars') for 1596 Aug 3 (jul.). Mira started to fainten 19 days later and was observed until mid/late Oct. We show why such a red star cannot be followed by the naked eye until ca. 6 mag: For Mira's color at disappearance and altitude from Frisia, the limit is reduced by ca. 1.0 mag. Since Fabricius connected the Mira brightening with the close-by prograde Jupiter, he re-detected it only 12 years later, probably shortly before a relatively bright maximum - discoveries are strongly affected by biases. A Mira period of 330.2 days is consistent with both the oldest data (from Fabricius 1596 to Hevelius 1660) and the most current data (VSX 2004-2023), so that we see no evidence for secular period or phase shifts. (We also present Fabricius' observations of P Cygni in 1602.)

          An improved method to search for flares from point sources of ultra-high-energy photons

 - **Abstract**
 Flares produced by certain classes of astrophysical objects may be sources of some ultra-high-energy particles, which, if they are photons, would group into clusters of events correlated in space and time. Identification of such clustering in cosmic-ray data would provide important evidence for possible existence of ultra-high-energy (UHE) photons and could potentially help identify their sources. We present an analysis method to search for space-time clustering of ultra-high-energy extensive air showers, namely the stacking method, which combines a time-clustering algorithm with an unbinned likelihood study. In addition, to enhance the capability to discriminate between signal (photon-initiated events) and background (hadron-initiated) events, we apply a photon tag. This involves using relevant probability distribution functions to classify each event as more likely to be either a photon or a hadron. We demonstrate that the stacking method can effectively distinguish between events initiated by photons and those initiated by hadrons (background). The number of photon events in a data sample, as well as the flare(s) duration can also be retrieved correctly. The stacking method with a photon tag requires only a few events to identify a photon flare. This method can be used to search for the cosmic ray sources and/or improve limits on the fluxes of UHE photons.

 "PeVatrons" refer to astrophysical sources capable of accelerating particles to energies $\sim$PeV and higher, potentially contributing to the cosmic ray spectrum in the knee region. Recently, HAWC and LHAASO have discovered a new type PeVatrons -- X-ray binaries, allowing us to investigate in greater depth of the contributions of these sources to cosmic rays around the knee region. There are hundreds of X-ray binaries in our galaxy observed, which are potential PeVatrons. In this work, we derive the radial distribution of X-ray binaries in the Galaxy. Then we use the DRAGON package to simulate this distribution, and calculate energy spectrum, anisotropy of cosmic rays as well as the resulting diffuse gamma ray emissions, after considering them as factories of cosmic rays in the knee energy bands. our findings show that the contribution from the X-ray binaries, especially microquarsars, may be dominant. More microquasar PeVatrons can be observed by LHAASO and HAWC in the future, and will confirm the contribution of microquasars to high energy cosmic rays.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) provide precise measurements of the cosmic expansion history through the comoving acoustic scale. The CMB angular scale measurement $\theta_*$ is particularly robust, constraining the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance to last scattering independently of the late-time cosmological model. For models with standard early-universe physics, this measurement strongly constrains possible deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at late times. We show that the null energy condition imposes strict inequalities on the BAO observables $D_H(z)$, $D_M(z)$, $D_V(z)$ and $F_{\rm AP}(z)$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM predictions. These inequalities demonstrate that certain deviations from $\Lambda$CDM are impossible for any physical dark energy model that respects the null energy condition. We also identify the regions of parameter space in the CPL parameterization $w(a) = w_0 + w_a(1-a)$ that can give predictions consistent with both the null energy condition and the observed CMB scale. While current DESI DR1 BAO measurements exhibit slight joint-constraint parameter tensions with $\Lambda$CDM, this tension only arises in directions that are inconsistent with the null-energy condition, so $\Lambda$CDM is favoured by acoustic scale measurements unless the null-energy condition is violated.

 - **Abstract**
 Different types of hot subdwarfs may have different origins, which will cause them to present different radial velocity (RV) variability properties. Only 6$\pm$4% of our single-lined He-rich hot subdwarfs that only show spectroscopic features of hot subdwarfs are found to be RV variable, which is lower than the fraction of single-lined He-poor sdB stars (31$\pm$3%). Single-lined sdB stars with effective temperatures ($T_{\rm eff}$) $\sim$ 25,000 $-$ 33,000 K show an RV-variability fraction of 34$\pm$5%, while lower RV-variability fractions are observed for single-lined sdB stars cooler than about 25,000 K (11$\pm$4%), single-lined sdB/OB stars with $T_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 33,000 $-$ 40,000 K and surface gravities about 5.7 $-$ 6.0 (13$\pm$3%), as well as single-lined sdO/B stars with $T_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 45,000 $-$ 70,000 K (10$\pm$7%). Single-lined hot subdwarfs with $T_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 35,000 $-$ 45,000 K located above the extreme horizontal branch (EHB) show a similar RV-variability fraction of 34$\pm$9% as single-lined sdB stars at about 25,000 $-$ 33,000 K. The largest RV-variability fraction of 51$\pm$8% is found in single-lined hot subdwarfs below the canonical EHB. The detected RV-variability fraction of our composite hot subdwarfs with an infrared excess in their spectral energy distributions is 9$\pm$3%, which is lower than that fraction of single-lined hot subdwarfs. Since the average RV uncertainty we measured in the LAMOST spectra is about 7.0 km/s, the lower detected RV-variability fraction for composite hot subdwarfs is expected because the RV amplitudes associated with long-period systems are lower.

 - **Abstract**
 The propagation of disturbances in the solar atmosphere is inherently three dimensional (3D), yet comprehensive studies on the spatial structure and dynamics of 3D wavefronts are scarce. Here we conduct high resolution 3D numerical simulations to investigate filament eruptions, focusing particularly on the 3D structure and genesis of EUV waves. Our results demonstrate that the EUV wavefront forms a dome like configuration subdivided into three distinct zones. The foremost zone, preceding the flux rope, consists of fast-mode shock waves that heat the adjacent plasma. Adjacent to either side of the flux rope, the second zone contains expansion waves that cool the nearby plasma. The third zone, at the juncture of the first two, exhibits minimal disturbances. This anisotropic structure of the wavefront stems from the configuration and dynamics of the flux rope, which acts as a 3D piston during eruptions :compressing the plasma ahead to generate fast mode shocks and evacuating the plasma behind to induce expansion waves. This dynamic results in the observed anisotropic this http URL, with synthetic EUV images from simulation data, the EUV waves are observable in Atmospheric Imaging Assembly 193 and 211 angstrom, which are identified as the fast mode shocks. The detection of EUV waves varies with the observational perspective: the face on view reveals EUV waves from the lower to the higher corona, whereas an edge on view uncovers these waves only in the higher corona.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by observed discrepancies between ACT DR4 and Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy power spectra, particularly in the cross-correlation of temperature and E-mode polarization, we investigate challenges that may be encountered in the comparison of satellite and ground-based CMB data. In particular, we focus on the effects of Fourier-space filtering and masking involving bright point sources. We show that the filtering operation generates bright cross-shaped artifacts in the map, which stretch far outside typical point-source masks. If not corrected, these artifacts can add bias or additional variance to cross-spectra, skewing results. However we find that the effect of this systematic is not large enough to explain the ACT-Planck differences presented with ACT DR4.

 - **Abstract**
 High-precision astrometry offers a promising approach to detect low-frequency gravitational waves, complementing pulsar timing array (PTA) observations. We explore the response of astrometric measurements to a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in synergy with PTA data. Analytical, covariant expressions for this response are derived, accounting for the presence of a possible dipolar anisotropy in the SGWB. We identify the optimal estimator for extracting SGWB information from astrometric observations and examine how sensitivity to SGWB properties varies with the sky positions of stars and pulsars. Using representative examples of current PTA capabilities and near-future astrometric sensitivity, we demonstrate that cross-correlating astrometric and PTA data can improve constraints on SGWB properties, compared to PTA data alone. The improvement is quantified through Fisher forecasts for the SGWB amplitude, spectral tilt, and dipolar anisotropy amplitude. In the future, such joint constraints could play a crucial role in identifying the origin of SGWB signals detected by PTAs.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how the multiplicity of binary, triple and quadruple star systems changes as the systems evolve from the zero-age main-sequence to the Hubble time. We find the change in multiplicity fractions over time for each data set, identify the number of changes to the orbital configuration and the dominant underlying physical mechanism responsible for each configuration change. Finally, we identify key properties of the binaries which survive the evolution. We use the stellar evolution population synthesis code Multiple Stellar Evolution (MSE) to follow the evolution of $3 \times 10^4$ of each 1+1 binaries, 2+1 triples, 3+1 quadruples and 2+2 quadruples. The coupled stellar and orbital evolution are computed each iteration. The systems are assumed to be isolated and to have formed in situ. We generate data sets for two different black hole natal kick mean velocity distributions (sigma = 10 km/s and sigma = 50 km/s and with and without the inclusion of stellar fly-bys. Our fiducial model has a mean black hole natal kick velocity if sigma = 10 km/s and includes stellar fly-bys. Each system has at least one star with an initial mass larger than 10 solar masses. All data will be publicly available. We find that at the end of the evolution the large majority of systems are single stars in every data set (> 85%). As the number of objects in the initial system increases, so too does the final non-single system fraction. The single fractions of final systems in our fiducial model are 87.8 +- 0.2 % for the 2 + 2s, 88.8 +- 0.3 % for the 3 + 1s, 92.3 +- 0.2 % for the 2 + 1s and 98.9 +- 0.3 % for the 1 + 1s.

 - **Abstract**
 Due to the large dynamic ranges involved with separating the cosmological 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn from galactic foregrounds, a well-calibrated instrument is essential to avoid biases from instrumental systematics. In this paper we present three methods for calibrating a global 21-cm cosmology experiment using the noise wave parameter formalisation to characterise a low noise amplifier including a careful consideration of how calibrator temperature noise and singularities will bias the result. The first method presented in this paper builds upon the existing conjugate priors method by weighting the calibrators by a physically motivated factor, thereby avoiding singularities and normalising the noise. The second method fits polynomials to the noise wave parameters by marginalising over the polynomial coefficients and sampling the polynomial orders as parameters. The third method introduces a physically motivated noise model to the marginalised polynomial method. Running these methods on a suite of simulated datasets based on the REACH receiver design and a lab dataset, we found that our methods produced a calibration solution which is equally as or more accurate than the existing conjugate priors method when compared with an analytic estimate of the calibrator's noise. We find in the case of the measured lab dataset the conjugate priors method is biased heavily by the large noise on the shorted load calibrator, resulting in incorrect noise wave parameter fits. This is mitigated by the methods introduced in this paper which calibrate the validation source spectra to within 5% of the noise floor.

          Experimental heating of complex organic matter at Titan's interior conditions supports contributions to atmospheric N2 and CH4

 - **Abstract**
 Titan's abundant atmospheric N2 and CH4 gases are notable characteristics of the moon that may help constrain its origins and evolution. Previous work suggests that atmospheric CH4 is lost on geologically short timescales and may be replenished from an interior source. Isotopic and noble gas constraints indicate that N2 may derive from a mixture of NH3 ice and heating of organic matter. Here, we report experimental results from hydrothermal alteration of insoluble organic matter from the Murchison meteorite and analog insoluble organic matter at temperatures and pressures that are relevant to Titan's interior. Our results indicate both CH4 and CO2 are formed, with the ratio between the two depending on a multitude of factors, particularly temperature and, to a lesser degree, the dielectric constant of water and carbonyl abundance in the starting material. Sufficient CH4 is produced to source Titan's atmospheric reservoir if temperatures are greater than 250°C. Nitrogen is volatilized, primarily in the form of NH3, in sufficient abundances to source at least 50% of Titan's atmospheric N2. The isotopic characteristics of volatilized material relative to the starting organics are consistent with current constraints for the nature of the accreted complex organics and Titan's evolved atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the generation of primordial black holes (PBHs) within the framework of single-field inflationary models and their compatibility with the cosmological history of the Universe. Our results suggest that, depending on the masses of the formed PBHs, single-field inflation models require more than fine-tuning a potential to induce ultra-slow roll; it necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the post-inflationary cosmological evolution. As an explicative example, we introduce a new model, based on a double inflection point and consistent with Cosmic Microwave Background observations, capable of generating sub-solar PBHs, whose merger could be potentially detectable by the LVK experiment.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the non-Gaussian tail of the curvature fluctuation, $\zeta$, in an inflationary scenario with a transient ultra slow-roll phase that generates a localized large enhancement of the spectrum of $\zeta$. To do so, we implement a numerical procedure that provides the probability distribution of $\zeta$ order by order in perturbation theory. The non-Gaussianities of $\zeta$ can be shown to arise from its non-linear relation to the inflaton fluctuations and from the intrinsic non-Gaussianities of the latter, which stem from its self interactions. We find that intrinsic non-Gaussianities, which have often been ignored to estimate the abundance of primordial black holes in this kind of scenario, are important. The relevance of the intrinsic contribution depends on the rapidity with which the transient ultra slow-roll phase occurs, as well as on its duration. Our method cannot be used accurately when the perturbative in-in formalism fails to apply, highlighting the relevance of developing fully non-perturbative approaches to the problem.

 There is increasing evidence that single-star evolutionary models are inadequate to reproduce all observational properties of massive stars. Binary interaction has emerged as a key factor in the evolution of a significant fraction of massive stars. In this study, we investigate the helium ($Y_{\mathrm He}$) and nitrogen ($\epsilon_{\mathrm N}$) surface abundances in a comprehensive sample of 180 Galactic O-type stars with projected rotational velocities $v\sin(i)\leq150{\mathrm km}\cdot{\mathrm s}^{-1}$. We found a subsample ($\sim20\%$ of the total, and $\sim80\%$ of the stars with $Y_{\mathrm He}\geq0.12$) with a $Y_{\mathrm He}$ and $\epsilon_{\mathrm N}$ combined pattern unexplainable by single-star evolution. We argue that the stars with anomalous surface abundance patterns are binary interaction products.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a cosmological model inspired by hybrid inflation, where two scalar fields representing dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) interact through a coupling that is proportional to the DE scalar field $1/\phi$. The strength of the coupling is governed solely by the initial condition of the scalar field, $\phi_i$, which parametrises deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In this model, the scalar field tracks the behaviour of DM during matter-domination until it transitions to DE while the DM component decays quicker than standard CDM during matter-domination, and is therefore different from some interacting DM-DE models which behaves like phantom dark energy. Using \textit{Planck} 2018 CMB data, DESI BAO measurements and Pantheon+ supernova observations, we find that the model allows for an increase in $H_0$ that can help reduce the Hubble tension. In addition, we find that higher values of the coupling parameter are correlated with lower values of $\omega_m$, and a mild decrease of the weak-lensing parameter $S_8$, potentially relevant to address the $S_8$ tension. Bayesian model comparison, however, reveals inconclusive results for most datasets, unless S$H_0$ES data are included, in which case a moderate evidence in favour of the hybrid model is found.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of strongly gravitationally lensed gravitational wave (GW) sources provide a unique opportunity for constraining their transverse motion, which otherwise is exceedingly hard for GW mergers in general. Strong lensing makes this possible when two or more images of the lensed GW source are observed, as each image essentially allows the observer to see the GW source from different directional lines-of-sight. If the GW source is moving relative to the lens and observer, the observed GW signal from one image will therefore generally appear blue- or redshifted compared to GW signal from the other image. This velocity induced differential Doppler shift gives rise to an observable GW phase shift between the GW signals from the different images, which provides a rare glimpse into the relative motion of GW sources and their host environment across redshift. We illustrate that detecting such GW phase shifts is within reach of next-generation ground-based detectors such as Einstein Telescope, that is expected to detect $\sim$hundreds of lensed GW mergers per year. This opens up completely new ways of inferring the environment of GW sources, as well as studying cosmological velocity flows across redshift.
