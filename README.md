#### Title:
          On Direct Estimation of Density Parameters and Hubble Constant for $\Lambda$CDM Universe using Hubble Measurements

 - **Abstract**
 The set of cosmological density parameters ($\Omega_{0m}h_{0}^{2}$, $\Omega_{0k}h_{0}^{2}$, $\Omega_{0\Lambda}h_{0}^{2}$) and Hubble constant ($\hat{h}_{0}$) are useful for fundamental understanding of the universe from many perspectives. In this article, we propose a new procedure to estimate these parameters for $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) universe in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) background. We generalize the two-point statistics first proposed by Sahni et al. (2008) to the three point case and estimate the parameters using currently available Hubble parameter ($H(z)$) values in the redshift range $0.07 \leq z \leq 2.36$ measured by differential age (DA) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) techniques. All the parameters are estimated assuming the general case of non-flat universe. Using both DA and BAO data we obtain $\Omega_{0m}h_{0}^{2}=0.1485 \pm 0.0065$, $\Omega_{0k}h_{0}^{2}=-0.0137 \pm 0.017$, $\Omega_{0\Lambda}h_{0}^{2}=0.3126 \pm 0.0145$ and $\hat{h}_{0}=0.6689 \pm 0.0021$. These results are in satisfactory agreement with the Planck results. An important advantage of our method is that to estimate the value of any one of the independent cosmological parameters one does not need to use the values for the rest of them. Each parameter is obtained solely from the measured values of Hubble parameters at different redshifts without any need to use values of other parameters. Such a method is expected to be less susceptible to the undesired effects of degeneracy issues between cosmological parameters during their estimations. Moreover, there is no requirement of assuming spatial flatness in our method.
#### Title:
          Properties of self-excited pulsations in 3D simulations of AGB stars and red supergiants

 - **Abstract**
 The characteristic variability of cool giants and supergiants is attributed to a combination of stellar pulsation and large-scale convective flows. Full 3D radiation-hydrodynamical modelling is an essential tool for understanding the nature of these dynamical processes. The parameter space in our 3D model grid of red giants has expanded in recent years. These models can provide many insights on the nature and properties of the pulsations, including the interplay between convection and pulsations. We treat 3D dynamical models of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and red supergiants similar to observational data. We aim to explore the relation between stellar parameters and the properties of the self-excited pulsations. Output from global 'star-in-a-box' models computed with the CO5BOLD radiation-hydrodynamics code were analysed, particularly in regards to the pulsation properties, to find possible correlations with input and emergent stellar parameters. The fast Fourier transform was applied to spherically averaged mass flows to identify possible radial pulsation periods beneath the photosphere of the modelled stars. Stellar parameters were investigated for correlations with the extracted pulsation periods. We find that the pulsation periods varied with the stellar parameters in good agreement with the current expectations. The pulsation periods follow Ritter's period-mean density relation well and our AGB models agree with period-luminosity relations derived from observations. A mass estimate formula was derived from the 3D models, relating the stellar mass to the fundamental mode pulsation period and the stellar radius. While the non-linearity of the interplay between the self-excited pulsations and the self-consistent convection complicates analyses, the resulting correlations are in good agreement with respect to current theoretical and observational understandings.
#### Title:
          Investigating the amplitude and rotation of the phase spiral in the Milky Way outer disc

 - **Abstract**
 Context: With the data releases from the astrometric space mission Gaia, the exploration of the structure of the Milky Way has developed in unprecedented detail and unveiled many previously unknown structures in the Galactic disc and halo. One such feature is the phase spiral where the stars in the Galactic disc form a spiral density pattern in the $Z-V_Z$ plane. Aims: We aim to characterize the shape, rotation, amplitude, and metallicity of the phase spiral in the outer disc of the Milky Way. This will allow us to better understand which physical processes caused the phase spiral and can give further clues to the Milky Way's past and the events that contributed to its current state. Methods: We use Gaia data release 3 (DR3) to get full position and velocity data on approximately 31.5 million stars, and metallicity for a subset of them. We then compute the angular momenta of the stars and develop a model to characterise the phase spiral in terms of amplitude and rotation at different locations in the disc. Results: We find that the rotation angle of the phase spiral changes with Galactic azimuth and Galactocentric radius, making the phase spiral appear to rotate about $3^\circ$ per degree in Galactic azimuth. Furthermore, we find that the phase spiral in the $2200 - 2400$ kpc km s$^{-1}$ range of angular momentum is particularly strong compared to the phase spiral that can be observed in the solar neighbourhood. The metallicity of the phase spiral appears to match that of the Milky Way disc field stars. Conclusions: We created a new model capable of fitting several key parameters of the phase spiral. We have been able to determine the rotation rate of the phase spiral and found a peak in the phase spiral amplitude which manifests as a very clear phase spiral when using only stars with similar angular momentum.
