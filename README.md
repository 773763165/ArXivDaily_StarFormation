 - **Abstract**
 The main challenge of 21 cm cosmology experiments is astrophysical foregrounds which are difficult to separate from the signal due to telescope systematics. An earlier study has shown that foreground residuals induced by antenna gain errors can be estimated and subtracted using the hybrid foreground residual subtraction (HyFoReS) technique which relies on cross-correlating linearly filtered data. In this paper, we apply a similar technique to the CHIME stacking analysis to subtract beam-induced foreground contamination. Using a linear high-pass delay filter for foreground suppression, the CHIME collaboration reported a $11.1\sigma$ detection in the 21 cm signal stacked on eBOSS quasar locations, despite foreground residual contamination mostly due to the instrument chromatic transfer function. We cross-correlate the foreground-dominated data at low delay with the contaminated signal at high delay to estimate residual foregrounds and subtract them from the signal. We find foreground residual subtraction can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the stacked 21 cm signal by $ 10 - 20\%$ after the delay foreground filter, although some of the improvement can also be achieved with an alternative flagging technique. We have shown that it is possible to use HyFoReS to reduce beam-induced foreground contamination, benefiting the analysis of the HI auto power spectrum with CHIME and enabling the recovery of large scale modes.

 - **Abstract**
 The interplay between cosmology and strongly coupled dynamics can yield transient spectral features that vanish at late times, but which may leave behind phenomenological signatures in the spectrum of primordial fluctuations. Of particular interest are strongly coupled extensions of the standard model featuring approximate conformal invariance. In flat space, the spectral density for a scalar operator in a conformal field theory is characterized by a continuum with scaling law governed by the dimension of the operator, and is otherwise featureless. AdS/CFT arguments suggest that for large $N$, in an inflationary background with Hubble rate $H$, this continuum is gapped. We demonstrate that there can be additional peak structures that become sharp and particle-like at phenomenologically interesting regions in parameter space, and we estimate their contribution to cosmological observables. We find phenomena that are potentially observable in future experiments that are unique to these models, including displaced oscillatory features in the squeezed limit of the bi-spectrum. These particles can be either fundamental, and localized to a UV brane, or composite at the Hubble scale, $H$, and bound to a horizon in the bulk of the 5D geometry. We comment on how stabilization of conformal symmetry breaking vacua can be correlated with these spectral features and their phenomenology.

 - **Abstract**
 Water must condense into ice clouds in the coldest brown dwarfs and exoplanets. When they form, these icy clouds change the emergent spectra, temperature structure, and albedo of the substellar atmosphere. The properties of clouds are governed by complex microphysics but these complexities are often not captured by the simpler parameterized cloud models used in climate models or retrieval models. Here, we combine microphysical cloud modeling and 1D climate modeling to incorporate insights from microphysical models into a self-consistent, parameterized cloud model. Using the 1D Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA), we generate microphysical water clouds and compare their properties with those from the widely-used EddySed cloud model (Ackerman & Marley 2001) for a grid of Y dwarfs. We find that the mass of water condensate in our CARMA water clouds is significantly limited by available condensation nuclei; in models without additional seed particles for clouds added, the atmosphere becomes supersaturated. We incorporate water latent heat release in the convective and radiative parts of the atmosphere and find no significant impact on water-ice cloud formation for typical gas giant compositions. Our analysis reveals the CARMA cloud profiles have a gradual decrease in opacity of approximately 4% per bar below the cloud base. Incorporating this gradual cloud base falloff and a variable $f_{sed}$ parameter allows spectra generated from the parameterized Eddysed model to better match those of the microphysical CARMA model. This work provides recommendations for efficiently generating microphysically-informed water clouds for future models of cold substellar objects with H/He atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 This work aims to analyze some of the polluters proposed in the self-enrichment scenarios put forward to explain the multiple populations in globular clusters (GCs), extending previous studies. Three scenarios with different polluter stars were tested: asymptotic giant branch stars, high-mass interacting binaries, and fast rotating massive stars. With abundance data available from the APOGEE survey and $\Delta Y$ estimates from precise HST photometry, twenty-six clusters were studied. We also included the study of the abundances of N, C, Mg and Al, extending previous studies that focused mainly on the abundances of He, O and Na. In addition, we constructed an empirical model to test whether one could explain the chemical signatures of the 'enriched' population of GC stars with a fixed source and dilution process based on empirical data. In agreement with work by other authors, we found that the proposed polluters can generally predict the qualitative abundance patterns in GC stars and in some cases quantitatively predict some elements, but in most cases when we compare the model yields with the observations, we find that they can not explain the entire set of observed abundance patterns. The empirical model succeeds in reproducing the abundances of Al for a given $\Delta Y$ (and vice versa), showing that there is a direct relationship between Al and He, with one increasing proportionally to the other. However, the empirical model fails to reproduce the observed abundances of Na and N, in agreement with the results of previous works. The observed decoupling between the maximum abundances of CNO-cycle elements like N and Na with those of Al and He provides new information and constraints for future models and could take us a step closer to understanding the origin of the peculiar abundance variations of globular cluster stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Observational evidence strongly supports the existence of a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH) at the Galactic center, surrounded by dense stellar clusters. Modeling galactic centers with intricate structures like shells and rings pose challenges, prompting the use of simplified models such as a spherical monopole potential with a multipolar halo mass distribution. This approach, employing a multipolar expansion model, provides versatility for numerical analyses, revealing the complex dynamics of stars in this region. Pseudo-Potentials like Paczynsky-Wiita and Artemova-Bjornsson-Novikov are utilized to simulate the impacts of strong gravity from non-rotating and rotating compact objects respectively, elucidating their influence on stellar dynamics. Chaos naturally arises due to non-central forces, visualized using the Poincaré section technique. Of particular importance is the utilization of the Smaller Alignment Index (SALI), a powerful nonlinear dynamical tool, which categorizes particle orbits as escaping, regular, sticky, or chaotic. We exhaustively examine all combinations of multipolar moments up to the octupolar term along with spin using this tool, which had not been studied earlier. SALI provides a straightforward yet efficient method for assessing the interplay between the system's different multipolar moments, their combinations, and spin. Thus, our findings offer insights into the dynamics of compact objects enshrouded in a halo mass distribution and lay the groundwork for understanding complex astrophysical systems in galactic centers.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a population model to analyze the mixing between hypothesised power-law and $\sim 35 M_\odot$ Gaussian bump black hole populations in the latest gravitational wave catalog, GWTC-3, estimating their co-location and separation. We find a relatively low level of mixing, $3.1^{+5.0}_{-3.1}\%$, between the power-law and Gaussian populations, compared to the percentage of mergers containing two Gaussian bump black holes, $5.0^{+3.2}_{-1.7}\%$. Our analysis indicates that black holes within the Gaussian bump are generally separate from the power-law population, with only a minor fraction engaging in mixing and contributing to the $\mathcal{M} \sim 14 M_\odot$ peak in the chirp mass. This leads us to identify a distinct population of Binary Gaussian Black Holes (BGBHs) that arise from mergers within the Gaussian bump. We suggest that current theories for the formation of the massive $35 M_\odot$ Gaussian bump population may need to reevaluate the underlying mechanisms that drive the preference for BGBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Subaru/SCExAO + CHARIS broadband (JHK) integral field spectroscopy of HD 34700 A in polarized light. CHARIS has the unique ability to obtain polarized integral field images at 22 wavelength channels in broadband, as the incoming light is first split into different polarization states before passing though the lenslet array. We recover the transition disk around HD 34700 A in multiband polarized light in our data. We combine our polarized intensity data with previous total intensity data to examine the scattering profiles, scattering phase functions and polarized fraction of the disk at multiple wavelengths. We also carry out 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations of the disk using MCFOST, and make qualitative comparisons between our models and data to constrain dust grain properties. We find that in addition to micron-sized dust grains, a population of sub-micron grains is needed to match the surface brightness in polarized light and polarized fraction. This could indicate the existence of a population of small grains in the disk, or it could be caused by Mie theory simulations using additional small grains to compensate for sub-micron structures of real dust aggregates. We find models that match the polarized fraction of the data but the models do not apply strong constraints on the dust grain type or compositions. We find no models that can match all observed properties of the disk. More detailed modeling using realistic dust aggregates with irregular surfaces and complex structures is required to further constrain the dust properties.

          A Buddy for Betelgeuse: Binarity as the Origin of the Long Secondary Period in $\alpha$ Orionis

 - **Abstract**
 We predict the existence of $\alpha$ Ori B, a low-mass companion orbiting Betelgeuse. This is motivated by the presence of a 2170-day Long Secondary Period (LSP) in Betelgeuse's lightcurve, a periodicity $\approx5$ times longer than the star's 416 day fundamental radial pulsation mode. While binarity is currently the leading hypothesis for LSPs in general, the LSP and the radial velocity variation observed in Betelgeuse, taken together, necessitate a revision of the prevailing physical picture. The lightcurve-RV phase difference requires a companion to be behind Betelgeuse at the LSP luminosity minimum, 180 degrees out of phase with the system orientation associated with occultation. We demonstrate the consistency of this model with available observational constraints and identify tensions in all other proposed LSP hypotheses. Within this framework, we calculate a mass for $\alpha$ Ori B of $1.17\pm0.7\,M_\odot$ and an orbital separation of $1850\pm70\,R_\odot$, or $2.43^{+0.21}_{-0.32}$ times the radius of Betelgeuse. We then describe the features of the companion as constrained by the fundamental parameters of Betelgeuse and its orbital system, and discuss what would be required to confirm the companion's existence observationally.

          Pursuing Truth: Improving Retrievals on Mid-Infrared Exo-Earth Spectra with Physically Motivated Water Abundance Profiles and Cloud Models

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric retrievals are widely used to constrain exoplanet properties from observed spectra. We investigate how the common nonphysical retrieval assumptions of vertically constant molecule abundances and cloud-free atmospheres affect our characterization of an exo-Earth (an Earth-twin orbiting a Sun-like star). Specifically, we use a state-of-the-art retrieval framework to explore how assumptions for the $\mathrm{H_2O}$ profile and clouds affect retrievals. In a first step, we validate different retrieval models on a low-noise simulated 1D mid-infrared (MIR) spectrum of Earth. Thereafter, we study how these assumptions affect the characterization of Earth with the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). We run retrievals on LIFE mock observations based on real disk-integrated MIR Earth spectra. The performance of different retrieval models is benchmarked against ground truths derived from remote sensing data. We show that assumptions for the $\mathrm{H_2O}$ abundance and clouds directly affect our characterization. Overall, retrievals that use physically motivated models for the $\mathrm{H_2O}$ profile and clouds perform better on the empirical Earth data. For observations of Earth with LIFE, they yield accurate estimates for the radius, pressure-temperature structure, and the abundances of $\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\mathrm{H_2O}$, and $\mathrm{O_3}$. Further, at $R=100$, a reliable and bias-free detection of the biosignature $\mathrm{CH_4}$ becomes feasible. We conclude that the community must use a diverse range of models for temperate exoplanet atmospheres to build an understanding of how different retrieval assumptions can affect the interpretation of exoplanet spectra. This will enable the characterization of distant habitable worlds and the search for life with future space-based instruments.

          Evidence for hybrid gamma-ray emission from the supernova remnant G150.3+4.5

 - **Abstract**
 The supernova remnant (SNR) G150.3+4.5 was first identified in radio, exhibiting a hard GeV spectrum and a $\sim 1.5^\circ$ radius. Radio observations revealed a bright arc with an index of $\sim -0.40$, which stands in contrast to the index of $\sim -0.69$ for the rest. This arc is coincident with the point-like \emph{Fermi} source 4FGL J0426.5+5434 and KM2A source 1LHAASO J0428+5531. The rest of the SNR has a hard GeV spectrum and a soft TeV spectrum, implying a spectral cut-off or break near 1 TeV. Since there is no X-ray counterpart and no pulse signal detected, the gamma-ray $(\gamma$-ray) emission mechanism from the SNR and the point-like source appear puzzling. In this work, we reanalyse the $\gamma$-ray emission using 14 yr data recorded by \emph{Fermi} Large Area Telescope and find that the spectrum of the northern half-sphere is compatible with a broken power law with a break at 146 $\pm$ 11 GeV and photon indices of $\Gamma_{\rm{Northlobe}}$ =$1.54\pm0.04_{\rm{stat}}\pm0.07_{\rm{syst}}$ ($2.28\pm0.08_{\rm{stat}}\pm0.12_{\rm{syst}}$) below (above) the break. In addition, the southern half-sphere can be described well with a single power law with $\Gamma_{\rm{Southlobe}}$ =$1.95\pm0.07_{\rm{stat}}\pm0.09_{\rm{syst}}$. Since the southern half-sphere is well correlated with CO emission, we propose that the $\gamma$-ray emission of the northern half-sphere could be dominated by relativistic electrons via inverse-Compton processes, while the southern half-sphere is dominated by cosmic rays via hadronic processes. 4FGL J0426.5+5434 may result from the illumination of a cloud by escaping cosmic rays or recent shock-cloud interaction. Observations from LHAASO-KM2A thus favour the possibility of a cosmic-ray PeVatron candidate, however, leptonic scenarios cannot be ruled out. Further multi-wavelength observations are warranted to confirm the hadronic nature of 1LHAASO J4028+5531.

 - **Abstract**
 The PDS 70 system, hosting two planets within its disk, is an ideal target for examining the effect of planets on dust accumulation, growth, and ongoing planet formation. Here, we present high-resolution ($0.''07 = 8 \ \mathrm{au}$) dust continuum observations of the PDS 70 disk in ALMA Band 3 (3.0 mm). While previous Band 7 observations showed a dust ring with slight asymmetry, our Band 3 observations reveal a more prominent asymmetric peak in the northwest direction, where the intensity is 2.5 times higher than in other directions and the spectral index is at the local minimum with $\alpha_{\mathrm{SED}} \sim 2.2$. This indicates that a substantial amount of dust is accumulated both radially and azimuthally in the peak. We also detect point-source emission around the stellar position in the Band 3 image, which is likely to be free-free emission. We constrain the eccentricity of the outer ring to be $e<0.04$ from the position of the central star and the outer ring. From the comparison with numerical simulations, we constrain the mass of PDS 70c to be less than 4.9 Jupiter masses if the gas turbulence strength $\alpha_{\mathrm{turb}} = 10^{-3}$. Then, we discuss the formation mechanism of the disk structures and further planet formation scenarios in the disk.

          Parabolic-like Trend in SiO Ratios throughout the Central Molecular Zone: Possible Signature of a Past Nuclear Activity in the Galactic Center

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a characteristic trend in the intensity ratios of SiO emissions across the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy. Using the Nobeyama Radio Observatory 45-m telescope, we conducted large-scale, high-sensitivity imaging observations in molecular lines including SiO $J$=2$-$1 and CS $J$=2$-$1. By identifying SiO-emitting clouds and examining their intensity ratios relative to the other molecular lines, we unveiled a parabolic-like trend showing lower ratios near the Galactic nucleus, Sgr A$^*$, with gradual increases toward the edges of the CMZ. This pattern suggests a possible outburst of the nucleus within the last $\sim 10^5$ yr, which may have propagated through the entire CMZ with strong shocks. Alternatively, the observed trend may also be attributed to the destruction of small dust grains by high-energy photons. Our results can potentially lead to a new perspective on the history of nuclear activity and its impact on the surrounding molecular environment.

          Analysis of the Effect of Tilted Corner Cube Reflector Arrays on Lunar Laser Ranging

 - **Abstract**
 This paper primarily investigates the effect of the tilt of corner cube reflector (CCR) arrays on lunar laser ranging (LLR). A mathematical model was established to study the random errors caused by the tilt of the CCR arrays. The study found that, ideally, when the laser ranging pulse width is 10 picoseconds or less, it is possible to distinguish from which specific corner cubes within the CCR array each peak in the echo signal originates. Consequently, partial data from the echo can be extracted for signal processing, significantly reducing random errors and improving the single-shot precision of LLR. The distance obtained by extracting part of the echo can be reduced to the center position of the array, thereby providing multiple higher-precision ranging results from each measurement. This not only improves the precision of LLR but also increases the data volume. A simulation experiment based on the 1.2 m laser ranging system at Yunnan Observatories was conducted. By extracting one peak for signal processing, the single-shot precision improved from 32.24 mm to 2.52 mm, validating the theoretical analysis results. Finally, an experimental laser ranging system based on a 53 cm binocular telescope system was established for ground experiments. The experimental results indicated that the echo signal could identify the tilt state of the CCR array. By extracting the peak returned by the central CCR for signal processing, the ranging precision was greatly improved. Through theoretical analyses, simulation experiments, and ground experiments, a solution to reduce the random errors caused by the tilt of the CCR array was provided. This offers an approach to enhance the single-shot precision of future LLR and provides a reference for upgrading ground-based equipment at future laser ranging stations.

          On the Age and Metallicity of Planet-hosting Triple Star Systems

 - **Abstract**
 We present a statistical analysis of the ages and metallicities of triple stellar systems that are known to host exoplanets. With controversial cases disregarded, so far 27 of those systems have been identified. Our analysis, based on an exploratory approach, shows that those systems are on average notably younger than stars situated in the solar neighborhood. Though the statistical significance of this result is not fully established, the most plausible explanation is a possible double selection effect due to the relatively high mass of planet-hosting stars of those systems (which spend less time on the main-sequence than low-mass stars) and that planets in triple stellar systems may be long-term orbitally unstable. The stellar metallicities are on average solar-like; however, owing to the limited number of data, this result is not inconsistent with the previous finding that stars with planets tend to be metal-rich as the deduced metallicity distribution is relatively broad.

          A choked jet in SN 2023ixf?

 - **Abstract**
 It has been proposed that core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) can take place along with the generation of a jet that fails to emerge from the stellar envelope of the progenitor star, i.e., a choked jet. Although the fraction of CCSNe that harbour such jets is unknown, it remains as an interesting possibility that can give rise to the production of high-energy neutrinos. In this work, we focus on the particular case of the recent type II supernova, SN 2023ixf, the closest of its class in the last decade. We describe the particle distributions of protons, pions, and muons in a putative jet applying a simple model to account for the relevant interactions, which are synchrotron cooling and interactions with the soft photon field in the ambient. After evaluating the produced fluence for different values of the viewing angle $i_{\rm j}$ with respect to the jet axis, and comparing with the upper bound by IceCube, we conclude that the generation of a choked jet in SN 2023ixf can not be ruled out. Specifically, for typical jet Lorentz factors of the jet $\Gamma=100$, the jet could have been produced with an half-opening angle $\theta_{\rm op}=0.2\,{\rm rad}$ but for a viewing angle $i_{\rm j}\gtrsim \theta_{\rm op}$, no significant Doppler boosting would take place along this direction. Therefore, the choked jet scenario in SN 2023ixf still remains compatible with observations provided our line of sight corresponds to an off-axis view of the jet.

 - **Abstract**
 The investigation of exoplanetary habitability is integral to advancing our knowledge of extraterrestrial life potential and detailing the environmental conditions of distant worlds. In this analysis, we explore the properties of exoplanets situated with respect to circumstellar habitable zones by implementing a sophisticated filtering methodology on data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. This research encompasses a thorough examination of 5,595 confirmed exoplanets listed in the Archive as of March 10th, 2024, systematically evaluated according to their calculated surface temperatures and stellar classifications of their host stars, taking into account the biases implicit in the methodologies used for their discovery. Our findings elucidate distinctive patterns in exoplanetary attributes, which are significantly shaped by the spectral classifications and mass of the host stars. The insights garnered from our study not only enhance the existing models for managing burgeoning exoplanetary datasets, but also lay foundational groundwork for future explorations into the dynamic relationships between exoplanets and their stellar environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the energy distribution of the fast radio burst (FRB) population using a well-defined sample of 63 FRBs from the ASKAP radio telescope, 28 of which are localised to a host galaxy. We apply the luminosity-volume ($V/V_{\mathrm{max}}$) test to examine the distribution of these transient sources, accounting for cosmological and instrumental effects, and determine the energy distribution for the sampled population over the redshift range $0.01 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.02$. We find the distribution between $10^{23}$ and $10^{26}$J Hz$^{-1}$ to be consistent with both a pure power-law with differential slope $\gamma=-1.96 \pm 0.15$, and a Schechter function with $\gamma = -1.82 \pm 0.12$ and downturn energy $E_{\rm max} \sim 6.3 \cdot 10^{25}$J Hz$^{-1}$. We identify systematic effects which currently limit our ability to probe the luminosity function outside this range and give a prescription for their treatment. Finally, we find that with the current dataset, we are unable to distinguish between the evolutionary and spectral models considered in this work.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting primordial fluctuations from the cosmic dark ages requires extremely large low-frequency radio telescope arrays deployed on the far side of the Moon. The antenna of such an array must be lightweight, easily storable and transportable, deployable on a large scale, durable, and capable of good electrical performance. A membrane antenna is an excellent candidate to meet these criteria. We study the design of a low-frequency membrane antenna for a lunar-based low-frequency (<30 MHz) radio telescope constructed from polyimide film widely used in aerospace applications, owing to its excellent dielectric properties and high stability as a substrate material. We first design and optimize an antenna in free space through dipole deformation and coupling principles, then simulate an antenna on the lunar surface with a simple lunar soil model, yielding an efficiency greater than 90% in the range of 12-19 MHz and greater than 10% in the range of 5-35 MHz. The antenna inherits the omni-directional radiation pattern of a simple dipole antenna in the 5-30 MHz frequency band, giving a large field of view and allowing detection of the 21 cm global signal when used alone. A demonstration prototype is constructed, and its measured electrical property is found to be consistent with simulated results using |S11| measurements. This membrane antenna can potentially fulfill the requirements of a lunar low-frequency array, establishing a solid technical foundation for future large-scale arrays for exploring the cosmic dark ages.

 - **Abstract**
 We test the $n$=3 Ultralight Axion-like model of Early Dark Energy (EDE) with the observations of the $EB$ mode of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and local expansion rate measurements. We find that the shape of the CMB $EB$ angular power spectrum is sensitive to the background cosmological parameters. Unlike previous articles which fix the background cosmology and fit % \lu{with fitting} the coupling constant and rotation angles, we run Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations to fit the $\Lambda$CDM + EDE parameters simultaneously. We find that the EDE model with $n$=3 can provide a good fit to the observed CMB $EB$ spectra, consistent with a Hubble constant value that is in good agreement with the locally measured value. Our result is the first to show that axion-like EDE can provide a unified explanation for the observed cosmic birefringence and the Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs and planetary-mass companions display rotationally modulated photometric variability, especially those near the L/T transition. This variability is commonly attributed to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) inhomogeneities, with proposed models including patchy thick and thin clouds, planetary-scale jets, or chemical disequilibrium. Surface mapping techniques are powerful tools to probe their atmospheric structures and distinguish between models. One of the most successful methods for stellar surface mapping is Doppler imaging, where the existence of TOA inhomogeneities can be inferred from their varying Doppler shifts across the face of a rotating star. We applied Doppler imaging to the nearest brown dwarf binary WISE 1049AB (aka Luhman 16AB) using time-resolved, high-resolution spectroscopic observations from Gemini IGRINS, and obtained for the first time H and K band simultaneous global weather map for brown dwarfs. Compared to the only previous Doppler map for a brown dwarf in 2014 featuring a predominant mid-latitude cold spot on WISE 1049B and no feature on WISE 1049A, our observations detected persistent spot-like structures on WISE 1049B in the equatorial to mid-latitude regions on two nights, and revealed new polar spots on WISE 1049A. Our results suggest stability of atmospheric features over timescale of days and possible long-term stable or recurring structures. H and K band maps displayed similar structures in and out of CO bands, indicating the cold spots not solely due to chemical hotspots but must involve clouds. Upcoming 30-m extremely large telescopes (ELTs) will enable more sensitive Doppler imaging of dozens of brown dwarfs and even a small number of directly-imaged exoplanets.

          Behavior of the Position and Ellipticity Angles at Polarization Mode Transitions in Pulsar Radio Emission

 - **Abstract**
 Polarization observations of radio pulsars show that abrupt transitions in the polarization vector's position angle can be accompanied by large excursions in the vector's ellipticity angle, suggesting the vector passes near the right or left circular pole of the Poincaré sphere. The behavior of the angles can be explained by a transition in dominance of the orthogonal polarization modes or a vector rotation caused by a change in the phase difference between the modes. Four polarization models are examined to quantify and understand the behavior of the angles at a mode transition: coherent polarization modes, partially coherent modes, incoherent modes with nonorthogonal polarization vectors, and incoherent orthogonal modes with an elliptically polarized emission component. In all four models, the trajectory of the mode transition on the Poincaré sphere follows the geodesic that connects the orientations of the mode polarization vectors. The results from the models can be similar, indicating that the interpretation of an observed transition within the context of a particular model is not necessarily unique. The polarization fraction of the emission and the average ellipticity angle depend upon the statistical character of the mode intensity fluctuations. The polarization fraction increases as the fluctuations increase. The excursion in ellipticity angle can be large when the mode intensities are quasi-stable and is suppressed when the intensity fluctuations are large.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of a Jupiter-like planet, HD 73344 d ($m_{d}=2.55^{+0.56}_{-0.46}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$, $a_{d}=6.70^{+0.25}_{-0.26}$ AU, $e_{d}=0.18^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$) based on 27-year radial velocity observations. HD 73344 also hosts a compact inner planetary system, including a transiting sub-Neptune HD 73344 b ($P_{b}=15.61\ \mathrm{days}$, $r_{b}=2.88^{+0.08}_{-0.07}\ \mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$) and a non-transiting Saturn-mass planet ($P_{c}=65.936\ \mathrm{days}$, $m_{c}\sin{i_c}=0.36^{+0.02}_{-0.02}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$). By analyzing TESS light curves, we identified a stellar rotation period of $9.03\pm{1.3}$ days. Combining this with $v\sin{i_*}$ measurements from stellar spectra, we derived a stellar inclination of $63.6^{+17.4}_{-16.5}\ \rm{deg} $. Furthermore, by combining radial velocities and Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric acceleration, we characterized the three-dimensional orbit of the outer giant planet and constrained its mutual inclination relative to the innermost transiting planet to be $46 <\Delta I_{bd}< 134\ \rm{deg}\ (1\sigma)$ and $20 <\Delta I_{bd}< 160\ \rm{deg}\ (2\sigma)$, strongly disfavoring coplanar architectures. Our analytical calculations and N-body simulation reveal that the two inner planets are strongly coupled with each other and undergo nodal precession together around the orbital axis of the giant planet. During nodal precession, the orbital inclination of inner planets oscillate with time and therefore become misaligned relative to the stellar spin axis. The formation of such systems suggests a history of planet-planet scattering or misalignment between the inner and outer components of protoplanetary disks. The upcoming release of Gaia DR4 will uncover more systems similar to HD 73344 and enable the study of the flatness of exoplanet systems with a mixture of inner and outer planetary systems on a statistical level.

          Modelling Hydrogen-deficient Carbon stars in MESA -- The effects of total mass and mass ratio

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrogen-deficient Carbon (HdC) stars are rare, low-mass, chemically peculiar, supergiant variables believed to be formed by a double white dwarf (DWD) merger, specifically of a Carbon/Oxygen- (CO-) and a Helium-white dwarf (He-WD). They consist of two subclasses -- the dust-producing R Coronae Borealis (RCB) variables and their dustless counterparts the dustless HdCs (dLHdCs). Additionally, there is another, slightly cooler set of potentially related carbon stars, the DY Persei type variables which have some, but not conclusive, evidence of Hydrogen-deficiency. Recent works have begun to explore the relationship between these three classes of stars, theorizing that they share an evolutionary pathway (a DWD merger) but come from different binary populations, specifically different total masses (M$_{\rm tot}$) and mass ratios ($q$). In this work, we use the MESA modelling framework that has previously been used to model RCB stars and vary the merger parameters, M$_{\rm tot}$ and $q$, to explore how those parameters affect the abundances, temperatures, and luminosities of the resultant post-merger stars. We find that lower M$_{\rm tot}$ and larger $q$'s both decrease the luminosity and temperatures of post-merger models to the region of the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram populated by the dLHdCs. These lower M$_{\rm tot}$ and larger $q$ models also have smaller oxygen isotopic ratios ($^{16}$O/$^{18}$O) which is consistent with recent observations of dLHdCs compared to RCBs. None of the models generated in this work can explain the existence of the DY Persei type variables, however this may arise from the assumed metallicity of the models.

          A Spatial Uniformity Check of Gaia DR3 Photometry and BP/RP Spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia DR3 photometry and BP/RP spectra have been widely used as reference in photometric calibrations. In this work, we check the spatial uniformity of Gaia DR3 photometry and BP/RP spectra by comparing the BP, RP and G bands photometry with the synthetic ones from the BP/RP spectra. The discrepancies have a small dispersion of 1.07, 0.55 and 1.02 mmag for the BP, RP, and G bands, respectively. However, the discrepancies exhibit obvious spatial patterns, which are clearly associated with the Gaia's scanning law. The patterns observed in the BP and G bands are similar, with discrepancies between photometry and spectra being more pronounced in these bands compared to the RP band. A further independent test with the Dark Energy Survey DR2 photometry reveals that the spatial patterns are more likely attributed to the Gaia DR3 BP/RP spectra, particularly in the BP band. On one hand, our results confirm the high spatial uniformity of Gaia data at the mmag level. On the other hand, our results suggest that the spatial uniformity of Gaia DR3 BP/RP spectra is not as good as that of Gaia DR3 photometry, and could be further improved in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Measurements of the obliquities in exoplanet systems have revealed some remarkable architectures, some of which are very different from the Solar System. Nearly 200 obliquity measurements have been obtained through observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect. Here we report on observations of 19 planetary systems that led to 17 clear detections of the RM effect and 2 less secure detections. After adding the new measurements to the tally, we use the entire collection of RM measurements to investigate four issues that have arisen in the literature. i) Does the obliquity distribution show a peak at approximately 90$^\circ$? We find tentative evidence that such a peak does exist when restricting attention to the sample of sub-Saturn planets and hot Jupiters orbiting F stars. ii) Are high obliquities associated with high eccentricities? We find the association to be weaker than previously reported, and that a stronger association exists between obliquity and orbital separation, possibly due to tidal obliquity damping at small separations. iii) How low are the lowest known obliquities? Among hot Jupiters around cool stars, we find the dispersion to be $1.4\pm0.7^\circ$, smaller than the 6$^\circ$ obliquity of the Sun, which serves as additional evidence for tidal damping. iv) What are the obliquities of stars with compact and flat systems of multiple planets? We find that they generally have obliquities lower than $10^\circ$, with several remarkable exceptions possibly caused by wide-orbiting stellar or planetary companions.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigated the presence of strictly periodic, as well as quasi-periodic signals, in the timing of the 25 millisecond pulsars from the EPTA DR2 dataset. This is especially interesting in the context of the recent hints of a gravitational wave background in these data, and the necessary further study of red-noise timing processes, which are known to behave quasi-periodically in some normal pulsars. We used Bayesian timing models developed through the run_enterprise pipeline: a strict periodicity was modelled as the influence of a planetary companion on the pulsar, while a quasi-periodicity was represented as a Fourier-domain Gaussian process. We found that neither model would clearly improve the timing models of the 25 millisecond pulsars in this dataset. This implies that noise and parameter estimates are unlikely to be biased by the presence of a (quasi-)periodicity in the timing data. Nevertheless, the results for PSRs J1744--1134 and J1012+5307 suggest that the standard noise models for these pulsars may not be sufficient. We also measure upper limits for the projected masses of planetary companions around each of the 25 pulsars. The data of PSR J1909--3744 yielded the best mass limits, such that we constrained the 95-percentile to 2*10^{-4} Earth-masses (roughly the mass of the dwarf planet Ceres) for orbital periods between 5 d--17 yr. These are the best pulsar planet mass limits to date.

          Long-term optical spectroscopy of B[e] star CI Cam in a quiet state

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution optical spectra of the B[e] star CI Cam were obtained on arbitrary dates 2002-2023 using the echelle spectrograph NES of the 6-m BTA telescope. The temporal variability of the powerful emissions of H$\alpha$ and HeI profiles is found. For two-peaked emissions with ``rectangular'' profiles, the intensity ratio of blue-shifted and red-shifted peaks is $V/R \ge 1$, except one date. A decrease in the intensity of all double-peaked emissions, Vr(emis-d), with ``rectangular'' profiles was revealed as they moved away in time from the 1998 outburst. The average velocity Vr(emis-d) for all observational dates varies in the range $(-50.8 ÷-55.7)\pm 0.2$ km/s. The half-amplitude of the change (standard deviation) is equal to $\Delta$Vr=2.5 km/s. The velocity for single-peaked ion emissions (SiIII, AlIII, FeIII) differs little from the values of Vr(emis-d), but the measurement accuracy for these emissions is worse: the average error for different dates ranges from 0.4 to 1.3 km/s. The systemic velocity is assumed to be Vsys=$-55.4\pm 0.6$ km/s according to the stable position of the forbidden emission [NII] 5754 A. The position of single-peaked emissions [OIII] 4959 and 5007 A is also stable: Vr[OIII]=$-54.2\pm 0.4$ km/s. Forbidden emissions [OI] 5577, 6300, 6363, [CaII] 7291 and 7324 A are absent from the spectra. Appearence of the emission near 4686 A is an infrequent event, its intensity rarely exceeds the noise level. Only a wide asymmetric emission with an intensity of about 16% above the local continuum was registered in the spectrum for March 9, 2015. Questions arise about the use of this emission to estimate the orbital period of the star and about localization of this feature in the CI Cam system. The photospheric absorptions of NII, SII, and FeIII with a variable position are identified.

 - **Abstract**
 COSINE-100 aims to conclusively test the claimed dark matter annual modulation signal detected by DAMA/LIBRA collaboration. DAMA/LIBRA has released updated analysis results by lowering the energy threshold to 0.75 keV through various upgrades. They have consistently claimed to have observed the annual modulation. In COSINE-100, it is crucial to lower the energy threshold for a direct comparison with DAMA/LIBRA, which also enhances the sensitivity of the search for low-mass dark matter, enabling COSINE-100 to explore this area. Therefore, it is essential to have a precise and quantitative understanding of the background spectrum across all energy ranges. This study expands the background modeling from 0.7 to 4000 keV using 2.82 years of COSINE-100 data. The modeling has been improved to describe the background spectrum across all energy ranges accurately. Assessments of the background spectrum are presented, considering the nonproportionality of NaI(Tl) crystals at both low and high energies and the characteristic X-rays produced by the interaction of external backgrounds with materials such as copper. Additionally, constraints on the fit parameters obtained from the alpha spectrum modeling fit are integrated into this model. These improvements are detailed in the paper.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the optimal sampling model, we synthesized the embedded clusters of ATLASGAL clumps with HII regions (HII-clumps). The 0.1 Myr isochrone was used to estimate the bolometric luminosity of each star in an embedded cluster, we also added the accretion luminosity of each star in the embeded cluster. The total bolometric luminosity of synthetic embedded clusters can well fit the observed bolometric luminosity of HII-clumps. More realistically, we considered the age spread in the young star and protostar populations in embedded clusters of HII-clumps by modeling both constant and time-varying star formation histories (SFHs). According to the age distribution of the stellar population, we distributed the appropriate isochrones to each star, and sorted out the fraction of stellar objects that are still protostars (Class 0 and Class I phases) to properly add their accretion luminosities. Compared to a constant SFH, burst-like and time-dependent SFHs can better fit the observational data. We found that as long as 20\% of the stars within the embedded cluster are still accreting, the contribution of accretion luminosity will be significant to the total bolometric luminosity of low-mass HII-clumps with mass log$_{10}$(M$_{\rm cl}$/M$_{\odot}$) $<$ 2.8. Variations in the accretion rate, the SFE and the initial mass function (IMF) and more physical processes like the external heating from HII regions and the flaring from pre-main sequence (PMS) stars and protostars need to be investigated to further explain the excess luminosity of low-mass HII-clumps.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a UV, optical and near-infrared (near-IR) study of the star-forming complexes in the nearby peculiar galaxy NGC 3718, using UVIT, GALEX, Spitzer and DECaLS imaging data. The galaxy has a disturbed optical morphology due to the multiple tidal arms, the warped disk and the prominent curved dust lanes, but in the near-IR, it appears to be a bulge-dominated galaxy. Its disturbed morphology makes it an excellent case to study star formation in a tidally disturbed galaxy that may have undergone a recent minor merger. To study the distribution and properties of the star-forming clumps (SFCs), we divided the galaxy within the R$_{25}$ (B band) radius into three parts --the upper, central and lower regions. Using the UV band images, we investigated the warped star-forming disk, the extended tidal arms, and the distribution and sizes of the 182 SFCs. Their distribution is 49, 60 and 73 in the galaxy's upper, central and lower regions, respectively. We determined the UV color, star-formation rates (SFRs), star-formation density ($\Sigma_{SFR}$) and ages of the SFCs.The central disk of the galaxy has a larger mean $\Sigma_{SFR}$ which is $\sim$3.3 and $\sim$1.6 times higher than the upper and lower regions, respectively. We also find that the SFCs in the central disk are older than those in the tidal arms. Our study thus shows that minor mergers can trigger the inside-out growth of galaxy disks, where the younger SFCs are in outer tidal arms and not in the inner disk.

 In this paper, we report the detection of the very-high-energy (VHE, $ 100{\rm\ GeV} < E < 100{\rm\ TeV} $) and ultra-high-energy (UHE, $E > 100\rm\ TeV$) $\gamma$-ray emissions from the direction of the young star-forming region W43, observed by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observation (LHAASO). The extended $\gamma$-ray source was detected with a significance of ${\sim}16\,\sigma$ by KM2A and ${\sim}17\,\sigma$ by WCDA, respectively. The angular extension of this $\gamma$-ray source is about 0.5 degrees, corresponding to a physical size of about 50 pc. We discuss the origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission and possible cosmic ray acceleration in the W43 region using multi-wavelength data. Our findings suggest that W43 is likely another young star cluster capable of accelerating cosmic rays (CRs) to at least several hundred TeV.

 - **Abstract**
 The $\delta N$ formalism is a powerful approach to compute non-linearly the large-scale evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation $\zeta$. It assumes a set of FLRW patches that evolve independently, but in doing so, all the gradient terms are discarded, which are not negligibly small in models beyond slow-roll. In this paper, we extend the formalism to capture these gradient corrections by encoding them in a homogeneous-spatial-curvature contribution assigned to each FLRW patch. For a concrete example, we apply this formalism to the ultra-slow-roll inflation, and find that it can correctly describe the large-scale evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation from the horizon exit. We also briefly discuss non-Gaussianities in this context.

 - **Abstract**
 On tidally locked lava planets, magma ocean can form on the permanent dayside. The circulation of the magma ocean can be driven by stellar radiation and atmospheric winds. The strength of ocean circulation and the depth of the magma ocean depend on external forcings and the dominant balance of the momentum equation. In this study, we develop scaling laws for the magma ocean depth, oceanic current speed, and ocean heat transport convergence driven by stellar and wind forcings in three different dynamic regimes: non-rotating viscosity-dominant Regime I, non-rotating inviscid limit Regime II, and rotation-dominant Regime III. Scaling laws suggest that magma ocean depth, current speed, and ocean heat transport convergence are controlled by various parameters, including vertical diffusivity/viscosity, substellar temperature, planetary rotation rate, and wind stress. In general, scaling laws predict that magma ocean depth ranges from a few meters to a few hundred meters. For Regime I, results from scaling laws are further confirmed by numerical simulations. Considering the parameters of a typical lava super-Earth, we found that the magma ocean is most likely in the rotation-dominant Regime III.

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar obliquity distribution of warm-Jupiter systems is crucial for constraining the dynamical history of Jovian exoplanets, as the warm Jupiters' tidal detachment likely preserves their primordial obliquity. However, the sample size of warm-Jupiter systems with measured stellar obliquities has historically been limited compared to that of hot Jupiters, particularly in hot-star systems. In this work, we present newly obtained sky-projected stellar obliquity measurements for warm-Jupiter systems, TOI-559, TOI-2025, TOI-2031, TOI-2485, TOI-2524, and TOI-3972, derived from the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, and show that all six systems display alignment with a median measurement uncertainty of 13 degrees. Combining these new measurements with the set of previously reported stellar obliquity measurements, our analysis reveals that single-star warm-Jupiter systems tend to be aligned, even around hot stellar hosts. This alignment exhibits a 3.4-$\sigma$ deviation from the $T_{\rm eff}-\lambda$ dependency observed in hot-Jupiter systems, where planets around cool stars tend to be aligned, while those orbiting hot stars show considerable misalignment. The current distribution of spin-orbit measurements for Jovian exoplanets indicates that misalignments are neither universal nor primordial phenomena affecting all types of planets. The absence of misalignments in single-star warm-Jupiter systems further implies that many hot Jupiters, by contrast, have experienced a dynamically violent history.

 - **Abstract**
 The use of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for foregrounds mitigation in data collected by the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) to measure the high-redshift 21-cm signal power spectrum has been shown to have issues of signal loss when the 21-cm signal covariance is misestimated. To address this problem, we have recently introduced covariance kernels obtained by using a Machine Learning based Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) algorithm in combination with simulations of the 21-cm signal. In this work, we apply this framework to 141 hours ($\approx 10$ nights) of LOFAR data at $z \approx 9.1$, and report revised upper limits of the 21-cm signal power spectrum. Overall, we agree with past results reporting a 2-$\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta^2_{21} < (80)^2~\rm mK^2$ at $k = 0.075~h~\rm Mpc^{-1}$. Further, the VAE-based kernel has a smaller correlation with the systematic excess noise, and the overall GPR-based approach is shown to be a good model for the data. Assuming an accurate bias correction for the excess noise, we report a 2-$\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta^2_{21} < (25)^2~\rm mK^2$ at $k = 0.075~h~\rm Mpc^{-1}$. However, we still caution to take the more conservative approach to jointly report the upper limits of the excess noise and the 21-cm signal components.

 We have used the UKIRT Hemisphere Survey (UHS) combined with the UKIDSS Galactic Cluster Survey (GCS), the UKIDSS Galactic Plane Survey (GPS), and the CatWISE2020 catalog to search for new substellar members of the nearest open cluster to the Sun, the Hyades. Eight new substellar Hyades candidate members were identified and observed with the Gemini/GNIRS near-infrared spectrograph. All eight objects are confirmed as brown dwarfs with spectral types ranging from L6 to T5, with two objects showing signs of spectral binarity and/or variability. A kinematic analysis demonstrates that all eight new discoveries likely belong to the Hyades cluster, with future radial velocity and parallax measurements needed to confirm their membership. CWISE J042356.23$+$130414.3, with a spectral type of T5, would be the coldest ($T_{\rm eff}$$\approx$1100 K) and lowest-mass ($M$$\approx$30 $M_{\rm Jup}$) free-floating member of the Hyades yet discovered. We further find that high-probability substellar Hyades members from this work and previous studies have redder near-infrared colors than field-age brown dwarfs, potentially due to lower surface gravities and super-solar metallicities.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), which induce correlated changes in millisecond pulsars' timing residuals. PTA collaborations around the world have recently announced evidence of a nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB), which may be produced by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The GWB is often modeled as following a power-law power spectral density (PSD); however, a GWB produced by a cosmological population of SMBHBs is expected to have a more complex power spectrum due to the discrete nature of the sources. In this paper, we investigate using a $t$-process PSD to model the GWB, which allows us to fit for both the underlying power-law amplitude and spectral index as well as deviations from that power law, which may be produced by individual nearby binaries. We create simulated data sets based on the properties of the NANOGrav 15-year data set, and we demonstrate that the $t$-process PSD can accurately recover the PSD when deviations from a power-law are present. With longer timed datasets and more pulsars, we expect the sensitivity of our PTAs to improve, which will allow us to precisely measure the PSD of the GWB and study the sources producing it.

 - **Abstract**
 The NANOGrav 15-year data provides compelling evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background at nanohertz frequencies. The simplest model-independent approach to characterizing the frequency spectrum of this signal consists in a simple power-law fit involving two parameters: an amplitude A and a spectral index \gamma. In this paper, we consider the next logical step beyond this minimal spectral model, allowing for a running (i.e., logarithmic frequency dependence) of the spectral index, \gamma_run(f) = \gamma + \beta \ln(f/f_ref). We fit this running-power-law (RPL) model to the NANOGrav 15-year data and perform a Bayesian model comparison with the minimal constant-power-law (CPL) model, which results in a 95% credible interval for the parameter \beta consistent with no running, \beta \in [-0.80,2.96], and an inconclusive Bayes factor, B(RPL vs. CPL) = 0.69 +- 0.01. We thus conclude that, at present, the minimal CPL model still suffices to adequately describe the NANOGrav signal; however, future data sets may well lead to a measurement of nonzero \beta. Finally, we interpret the RPL model as a description of primordial GWs generated during cosmic inflation, which allows us to combine our results with upper limits from big-bang nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, and LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA.

 - **Abstract**
 The Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) combines high contrast imaging with high resolution spectroscopy (R$\sim$35,000 in K band) to study directly imaged exoplanets and brown dwarfs in unprecedented detail. KPIC aims to spectrally characterize substellar companions through measurements of planetary radial velocities, spins, and atmospheric composition. Currently, the dominant source of systematic noise for KPIC is fringing, or oscillations in the spectrum as a function of wavelength. The fringing signal can dominate residuals by up to 10% of the continuum for high S/N exposures, preventing accurate wavelength calibration, retrieval of atmospheric parameters, and detection of planets with flux ratios less than 1% of the host star. To combat contamination from fringing, we first identify its three unique sources and adopt a physically informed model of Fabry-Pérot cavities to apply to post-processed data. We find this strategy can effectively model the fringing in observations of A0V/F0V stars, reducing the residual systematics caused by fringing by a factor of 2. Next, we wedge two of the transmissive optics internal to KPIC to eliminate two sources of fringing and confirm the third source as the entrance window to the spectrograph. Finally, we apply our previous model of the Fabry-Pérot cavity to new data taken with the wedged optics to reduce the amplitude of the residuals by a factor of 10.

          Three-stage Formation of Cap Carbonates after Marinoan Snowball Glaciation Consistent with Depositional Timescales and Geochemistry

 - **Abstract**
 At least two global "Snowball Earth" glaciations occurred during the Neoproterozoic Era (1000-538.8 million years ago). Post-glacial surface environments during this time are recorded in cap carbonates: layers of limestone or dolostone that directly overlie glacial deposits. Postulated environmental conditions that created the cap carbonates lack consensus largely because single hypotheses fail to explain the cap carbonates' global mass, depositional timescales, and geochemistry of parent waters. Here, we present a global geologic carbon cycle model before, during, and after the second glaciation (i.e. the Marinoan) that explains cap carbonate characteristics. We find a three-stage process for cap carbonate formation: (1) low-temperature seafloor weathering during glaciation generates deep-sea alkalinity; (2) vigorous post-glacial continental weathering supplies alkalinity to a carbonate-saturated freshwater layer, rapidly precipitating cap carbonates; (3) mixing of post-glacial meltwater with deep-sea alkalinity prolongs cap carbonate deposition. We suggest how future geochemical data and modeling refinements could further assess our hypothesis.

          The Resonant Remains of Broken Chains from Major and Minor Mergers

 - **Abstract**
 Observations with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and Kepler have revealed that practically all close-in sub-Neptunes form in mean-motion resonant chains, most of which unravel on timescales of 100 Myr. Using a series of N-body integrations, we study how planetary collisions resulting from the destabilization of resonant chains produce the distribution of orbital periods observed among mature systems, focusing on the resonant fine structures that remain post-instability. In their natal chains, planets near first-order resonances have period ratios just wide of perfect commensurability, driven there by disk migration and eccentricity damping. Sufficiently large resonant libration amplitudes (of unknown origin) are needed to trigger instability. Ensuing collisions between planets ("major mergers") erode but do not completely eliminate resonant pairs; survivors which avoid mergers show up as narrow "peaks" just wide of commensurability in the histogram of neighboring-planet period ratios. Merger products exhibit a broad range of period ratios, with each resonant peak in the histogram spawning a continuum of ratios wide of the given resonance. These continua may fill in period ratios between relatively closely separated resonances such as the 5:4, 4:3, and 3:2, but may fail to bridge the relatively wide gap between the 3:2 and the 2:1. Thus a "trough" manifests just short of the 2:1 resonance (and only the 2:1 resonance), as observed. Major mergers are not perfect, and generate collisional debris which undergoes "minor mergers" with planets, in many cases further widening resonant pairs. With all this dynamical activity, free eccentricities of resonant pairs, and by extension the phases of their transit timing variations (TTVs), are readily excited. Because non-resonant planets are merger products, they are predicted to have higher masses than resonant planets.
