#### On the initial spin period distribution of neutron star

 - **Abstract**
 We derive the initial spin period distribution of neutron stars by studying the population of young pulsars associated with supernova remnants. Our hierarchical Bayesian approach accounts for the measurement uncertainties of individual observations and selection effects. Without correcting for selection effects, as done in previous studies, we find that pulsar initial spin periods follow a Weibull distribution, peaking at 40~ms, which is favoured against the lognormal distribution with a Bayes factor of 200. The known selection effects in radio pulsar surveys, including pulse broadening and a period-dependent beaming fraction, have been quantitatively investigated. We show that, based on measurements of pulsar luminosity and spin period from the ATNF Pulsar Catalogue, the impact of pulse broadening on the inference of pulsar initial period distribution is likely to be insignificant. Correcting for the beaming selection effect, a Weibull distribution remains to be the preferred model, while its peak slightly shifts to longer periods at 50~ms. Our method will prove useful in constraining the birth properties of neutron stars in the Square Kilometre Array era.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first Chandra X-ray observations of H72.97-69.39, a highly-embedded, potential super-star cluster (SSC) in its infancy located in the star-forming complex N79 of the Large Magellanic Cloud. We detect particularly hard, diffuse X-ray emission that is coincident with the young stellar object (YSO) clusters identified with JWST, and the hot gas fills cavities in the dense gas mapped by ALMA. The X-ray spectra are best fit with either a thermal plasma or power-law model, and assuming the former, we show that the X-ray luminosity of L_X = (1.5 +- 0.3)e34 erg/s is a factor of ~20 below the expectation for a fully-confined wind bubble. Our results suggest that stellar wind feedback produces diffuse hot gas in the earliest stages of massive star cluster formation and that wind energy can be lost quickly via either turbulent mixing followed by radiative cooling or by physical leakage.

 - **Abstract**
 The classical nova CP Puppis has been observed to have particularly puzzling and peculiar properties. In particular, this classical nova displays occasional bursts in its long-term ASAS-SN light curve. Here we report on 5 sectors of TESS data displaying 2 of these rapid bursts, lasting ~1 day. Based on the estimated lower energy limits of the bursts we discuss whether the bursts may be examples of micronovae resulting from localised thermonuclear explosion. Furthermore, its orbital period remains uncertain, with several inconsistent periodic signals appearing in spectroscopic and photometric observations at various wavelengths. Although we cannot unambiguously unravel the physical origin of the signals, the previously suggested nature of CP Puppis as a long orbital period system may be a viable explanation. The recurrence time of the bursts in CP Puppis, together with the unexplained variable modulations make it a prime candidate for intense monitoring.
#### Fleeting but not Forgotten: the Imprint of Escaping Hydrogen Atmospheres  on Super-Earth Interiors

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14072
 - **Abstract**
 Small, close-in exoplanets are divided into two sub-populations: super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. Most super-Earths are thought to have lost their primordially accreted hydrogen-dominated atmospheres via thermally driven winds. We consider the global chemical equilibrium of super-Earths and the lasting impacts of their fleeting hydrogen atmospheres. We find that hydrogen is efficiently sequestered into the interior, oxidising iron and endogenously producing $\sim0.5-1.0\%$ water by mass. As the atmospheres of super-Earths are continuously sculpted by mass loss and chemical equilibration, they remain hydrogen-dominated by mole (number) fraction but become steam-dominated by mass, which may be observable with \textit{JWST} for planets transitioning across the radius valley. One of the main effects of efficient sequestration of hydrogen into the interior is to produce an under-dense bulk interior compared to that of Earth. We predict bulk densities of super-Earths to be $\sim 5.0 \text{ g cm}^{-3}$ for a $1M_\oplus$ planet, which is consistent with high-precision mass measurements and also population-level inference analyses from atmospheric escape models.
#### ESA Science Programme Missions: Contributions and Exploitation --  XMM-Newton Observing Time Proposals

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14075
 - **Abstract**
 We examine the outcomes of the regular announcements of observing opportunities for ESA's X-ray observatory XMM-Newton issued between 2001 and 2021. We investigate how success rates vary with the lead proposer's gender, academic age and the country where the proposer's institute is located. The large number of proposals (10,579) and more than 20 years operational lifetime enable the evolution of community proposing for XMM-Newton to be probed. We determine proposal success rates for high-priority and all proposals using both the numbers of accepted proposals and the amounts of awarded observing time. We find that male lead proposers are between 5--15\% more successful than their female counterparts in obtaining XMM-Newton observations. The gender balance and the percentage of successful young proposers are comparable to those of HST after the introduction of dual-anonymous reviewing of HST proposals. We investigate potential correlations between the female-led proposal success rates and the amount of female participation in the Time Allocation Committee. We propose additional investigations to better understand the outcomes presented here.
#### The Solar Neighborhood LI: A Variability Survey of Nearby M Dwarfs with  Planets from Months to Decades with TESS and the CTIO/SMARTS 0.9 m

 - **Abstract**
 We present the optical photometric variability of 32 planet-hosting M dwarfs within 25 parsecs over timescales of months to decades. The primary goal of this project, ATLAS -- A Trail to Life Around Stars, is to follow the trail to life by revealing nearby M dwarfs with planets that are also "quiet", which may make them more amiable to habitability. There are 69 reported exoplanets orbiting the 32 stars discussed here, providing a rich sample of worlds for which environmental evaluations are needed. We examine the optical flux environments of these planets over month-long timescales for 23 stars observed by TESS, and find that 17 vary by less than 1% ($\sim$11 mmag). All 32 stars are being observed at the CTIO/SMARTS 0.9 m, with a median duration of 19.1 years of optical photometric data in the $VRI$ bands. We find over these extended timescales that six stars show optical flux variations less than 2%, 25 vary from 2--6% ($\sim$22-67 mmag), and only one, Proxima Centauri, varies by more than 6%. Overall, LHS 1678 exhibits the lowest optical variability levels measured over all timescales examined, thereby providing one of the most stable photometric environments among planets reported around M dwarfs within 25 parsecs. More than 600 of the nearest M dwarfs are being observed at the 0.9 m in the RECONS program that began in 1999, and many more planet hosts will undoubtedly be revealed, providing more destinations to be added to the ATLAS sample in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Studies on the dynamics of solar filaments have significant implications for understanding their formation, evolution, and eruption, which are of great importance for space weather warning and forecasting. The H$\alpha$ Imaging Spectrograph (HIS) onboard the recently launched Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE) can provide full-disk solar H$\alpha$ spectroscopic observations, which bring us an opportunity to systematically explore and analyze the plasma dynamics of filaments. The dramatically increased observation data require automate processing and analysis which are impossible if dealt with manually. In this paper, we utilize the U-Net model to identify filaments and implement the Channel and Spatial Reliability Tracking (CSRT) algorithm for automated filament tracking. In addition, we use the cloud model to invert the line-of-sight velocity of filaments and employ the graph theory algorithm to extract the filament spine, which can advance our understanding of the dynamics of filaments. The favorable test performance confirms the validity of our method, which will be implemented in the following statistical analyses of filament features and dynamics of CHASE/HIS observations.
#### Color-flavor locked strange stars with a mirror-dark-matter core and the  observations of compact stars

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the structure and the tidal deformability of the color-flavor locked strange stars with a mirror-dark-matter core. Assuming the stars in the GW170817 event have a mirror-dark-matter core, the observations of the central compact object within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347 and the compact objects in the GW190814 and GW170817 events could be explained simultaneously with a pairing gap much smaller than 200 MeV, while a pairing gap larger than about 200 MeV must be employed without the consideration of a mirror-dark-matter core. More importantly, we find that for the case of the quartic coefficient $a_{4}< 0.589$, if the mirror-dark-matter core in the compact stars of GW170817 is large enough (e.g., the mass fraction of the mirror-dark-matter core is larger than 22.8% for $a_{4}= 0.55$), the minimum allowed value of the pairing gap could be less than 46.5 MeV (i.e., one half of the value of the strange quark mass which is taken as 93 MeV in this paper), which leads to the result that all astrophysical observations mentioned above could be satisfied without violating the conformal bound or the recently proposed positive trace anomally bound.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae can be a copious source of sterile neutrinos, hypothetical particles that mix with active neutrinos. We develop two-dimensional stellar core-collapse models that incorporate the mixing between tau neutrinos and heavy sterile neutrinos -- those with the mass of 150--200 MeV -- to investigate signatures of sterile neutrinos in supernova observables. We find that the decay channel of a sterile neutrino into a pion and a tau neutrino can enhance the explosion energy and the synthesized nickel mass. Although the inclusion of sterile neutrinos considered in this study slightly reduce the neutrino and gravitational-wave signals, we find that they are still detectable for a Galactic event. Furthermore, we point out that if sterile neutrinos are as massive as ~200 MeV, they produce high-energy tau antineutrinos with energies of ~80 MeV, the detection of which can be a smoking signature of the sterile neutrinos and where Hyper-Kamiokande should play a pivotal role.

 - **Abstract**
 Transport-induced quenching in hot Jupiter atmospheres is a process that determines the boundary between the part of the atmosphere at chemical equilibrium and the part of the atmosphere at thermochemical (but not photothermochemical) disequilibrium. The location of this boundary, the quench level, depends on the interplay between the dynamical and chemical timescales in the atmosphere, with quenching occurring when these timescales are equal. We explore the sensitivity of the quench level position to an increase in the planet's atmospheric metallicity using aerosol-free 3D GCM simulations of a hot Jupiter WASP-96b. We find that the temperature increase at pressures of $\sim$$10^{4}-10^{7}$ Pa that occurs when metallicity is increased could shift the position of the quench level to pressures dominated by the jet, and cause an equatorial depletion of $CH_4$, $NH_3$ and $HCN$. We discuss how such a depletion affects the planet's transmission spectrum, and how the analysis of the evening-morning limb asymmetries, especially within $\sim3-5 {\mu}m$, could help distinguish atmospheres of different metallicities that are at chemical equilibrium from those with the upper layers at thermochemical disequilibrium.
#### Upper Limits of $^{44}$Ti Decay Emission in Four Nearby Thermonuclear  Supernova Remnants

 - **Abstract**
 To identify progenitors and investigate evidence of He burning, we searched for decay radiation of freshly synthesized $^{44}$Ti in four young nearby thermonuclear supernova remnants: Kepler, SN 1885, G1.9+0.3 and SN 1006, by analysing the up-to-date NuSTAR archival data. No apparent flux excess from the 68 and 78 keV line emissions accompanying decay was detected above the power law continuum applied for the remnants and the absorbed stray light. By comparing the inferred upper limits of the line flux and the initial $^{44}$Ti masses with a wide variety of supernova nucleosynthesis models, we placed constraints on the supernova progenitors. We derived the first NuSTAR line flux upper limit for Kepler and ruled out most of the double-detonation scenarios with a thick He layer under low density. We estimated, for the first time, the upper limit for SN 1885, which is high because of the large distance yet still remains consistent with the He shell detonation. The new flux and mass limit of G1.9+0.3 derived from a longer total exposure is lower than the results from previous studies and evidently excludes explosive burning of He-rich matter. The relatively advanced age and the large spatial extent of SN 1006 have prevented meaningful constraints.
#### Cool and Data-Driven: An Exploration of Optical Cool Dwarf Chemistry  with Both Data-Driven and Physical Models

 - **Abstract**
 Detailed chemical studies of F/G/K -- or Solar-type -- stars have long been routine in stellar astrophysics, enabling studies in both Galactic chemodynamics, and exoplanet demographics. However, similar understanding of the chemistry of M and late-K dwarfs -- the most common stars in the Galaxy -- has been greatly hampered both observationally and theoretically by the complex molecular chemistry of their atmospheres. Here we present a new implementation of the data-driven \textit{Cannon} model, modelling $T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], and [Ti/Fe] trained on low-medium resolution optical spectra ($4\,000-7\,000\,$\SI{}{\angstrom}) from 103 cool dwarf benchmarks. Alongside this, we also investigate the sensitivity of optical wavelengths to various atomic and molecular species using both data-driven and theoretical means via a custom grid of MARCS synthetic spectra, and make recommendations for where MARCS struggles to reproduce cool dwarf fluxes. Under leave-one-out cross-validation, our \textit{Cannon} model is capable of recovering $T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], and [Ti/Fe] with precisions of 1.4\%, $\pm0.04\,$dex, $\pm0.10\,$dex, and $\pm0.06\,$dex respectively, with the recovery of [Ti/Fe] pointing to the as-yet mostly untapped potential of exploiting the abundant -- but complex -- chemical information within optical spectra of cool stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We are performing a line survey of 8 planet-forming Class II disks in Taurus with the IRAM NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA), as a part of the MPG-IRAM Observatory Program PRODIGE (PROtostars and DIsks: Global Evolution; PIs: P. Caselli and Th. Henning). Compact and extended disks around T Tauri stars CI, CY, DG, DL, DM, DN, IQ Tau, and UZ Tau E are observed in ~80 lines from >20 C-, O,- N-, and S-bearing species. The observations in four spectral settings at 210-280 GHz with $1\sigma$ rms sensitivity of ~8-12 mJy/beam at 0.9" and 0.3 km/s resolution will be completed in 2024. The uv-visibilities are fitted with the DiskFit model to obtain key stellar and disk properties. In this paper, the combined $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O $J = 2-1$ data are presented. We find that the CO fluxes and disk masses inferred from dust continuum tentatively correlate with the CO emission sizes. We constrain dynamical stellar masses, geometries, temperatures, the CO column densities and gas masses for each disk. The best-fit temperatures at 100 au are ~17-37 K, and decrease radially with the power-law exponent q ~ 0.05-0.76. The inferred CO column densities decrease radially with the power-law exponent p ~ 0.2-3.1. The gas masses estimated from $^{13}$CO (2-1) are ~ $0.001-0.2 M_\textrm{Sun}$. The best-fit CO column densities point to severe CO freeze-out in the disks. The DL Tau disk is an outlier, and has either stronger CO depletion or lower gas mass than the rest of the sample. The CO isotopologue ratios are roughly consistent with the observed values in disks and the low-mass star-forming regions.
#### High-resolution spectroscopic analysis of four unevolved barium stars

 - **Abstract**
 A classical Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium analysis, based on high-resolution spectroscopic data, is performed for a sample of three potential barium dwarf candidates and one star already recognized as such. We derived their atmospheric parameters, estimated their masses and luminosities, and determined chemical abundances for a set of 21 elements, including CNO. Some elemental abundances are derived for the first time in HD~15096, HD~37792, and HD~141804. The program stars are dwarfs/subgiants with metallicities typical of disc stars, exhibiting moderate carbon enhancements, with $\rm{[C/Fe]}$ ratios ranging from $+0.29$ to $+0.66$ dex, and high levels of \textit{slow} neutron-capture ($s$-process) elements, with $\rm{[\textit{s}/Fe]}\gtrsim +1.0$~dex. As spectroscopic binaries, their peculiarities are attributable to mass transfer events. The observed neutron-capture patterns of were individually compared with two sets of $s$-process nucleosynthesis models (Monash and {\sc fruity}), yielding dilution factors and masses estimates for the former polluting Asymptotic Giant Branch stars. Low-mass ($\lesssim 3.0~\rm{M}_{\odot}$) models successfully reproduce the observations. In addition, we estimated mean neutron exposures of the order of 0.6 -- 0.7 mb$^{-1}$ for the $s$-processed material observed in their envelopes. Applying an empirical initial-final mass relation, we constraint in $\sim 0.7\,\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ the mass of their dim white-dwarf companions. Moreover, our kinematic study revealed that the program stars are members of the thin disk, with probabilities greater than 70\%. Hence, we identified HD~15096 and HD~37792 as new barium dwarfs and confirmed that HD~141804 is a barium dwarf. Thus, the number of barium dwarfs identified in the literature from high-resolution spectroscopy increases to 71 objects.

 - **Abstract**
 With the advent of JWST and spectroscopic characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with unprecedented detail, there is a demand for a more complete picture of chemical and photochemical reactions and their impact on atmospheric composition. Traditionally, building reaction networks for (exo)planetary atmospheres involves manually tracking relevant species and reactions, a time-consuming and error-prone process. This approach's applicability is also often limited to specific conditions, making it less versatile for different planetary types. (i.e., photochemical networks for Jupiters may not be directly applicable to water-rich exoplanets). We introduce an automated approach using a computer-aided chemical reaction network generator, combined with a one-dimensional photochemical kinetic-transport model, offering significant advantages. This approach automatically selects reaction rates through a rate-based iterative algorithm and refinement steps, enhancing model reliability. Also, this approach allows for the efficient simulation of diverse chemical environments, from hydrogen to water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen-dominated atmospheres. Using WASP-39b and WASP-80b as examples, we demonstrate our approach's effectiveness. Our WASP-39b model aligns with prior studies and JWST observations, capturing photochemically produced sulfur dioxide. The WASP-80b model reveals an atmosphere influenced by deep interior thermochemistry and vertical mixing, consistent with JWST NIRCam observations. Furthermore, our model identifies a novel initial step for the N2-NH3-HCN pathway that enhances the conversion efficiency in high-temperature/pressure environments. This automated chemical network generation offers a novel, efficient, and precise framework for studying exoplanetary atmospheres, marking a significant advancement over traditional modeling techniques.
