#### Hunting for Hydrated Minerals on Trans-Neptunian Objects

 - **Abstract**
 We present new optical reflectance spectra of three potentially silicate-rich Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs). These spectra were obtained with the aim of confirming past hints and detections of 0.7 micron absorption features associated with the presence of iron-bearing phyllosilicates. Our new spectrum of 120216 (2004 EW95) presents clearly detected absorption features that are similar in shape to hydrated mineral absorption bands present in the spectra of aqueously altered outer-main belt asteroids. Four new reflectance spectra of 208996 (2003 AZ84) obtained at separate epochs all appear featureless, but vary significantly in spectral gradient (between approximately 3.5 %/0.1 micron and 8.5 %/0.1 micron) on a timescale consistent with this object's nominal rotational period. We report the first four optical reflectance spectra of 90568 (2004 GV9), finding them all to be featureless but consistent with colors previously reported for this object. We speculate that impacts are the only mechanism capable of delivering, excavating, or forming hydrated minerals at the surfaces of TNOs in detectable concentrations; as a result, any deposits of hydrated minerals on TNOs are predicted to be localized and associated with impact sites. Globally altered TNOs (as observationally suggested for 2004 EW95) plausibly formed more easily at smaller heliocentric distances (< 15 au) before being transplanted into the current Trans-Neptunian population.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first X-ray polarimetric study of the dipping accreting neutron star 4U~1624$-$49 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). We report a detection of polarization in the non-dip time intervals with a confidence level of 99.99\%. We find an average polarization degree (PD) of $3.1\%\pm0.7\%$ and a polarization angle of $81\pm6$ degrees (east of north) in the 2--8 keV band. We report an upper limit on the PD of 22\% during the X-ray dips with 95\% confidence. There is marginal (95.3\% confidence) evidence for an increase of PD with energy. We fit the spectra with the absorbed sum of a black body plus a cutoff power-law component and separately with the absorbed sum of a multitemperature blackbody accretion disk and thermal Comptonization component. The polarization is predominantly derived from the Comptonization component in the second model, while the origin of the polarization cannot be distinguished in the first model. The relatively large PD of the source (up to $6\%\pm2\%$ in the 6--8 keV band) is unlikely to be produced by Comptonization in the boundary layer or spreading layer alone. It can be produced by the addition of an extended geometrically thin slab corona covering part of the accretion disk, as assumed in previous models of dippers, and/or a reflection component from the accretion disk.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze 1602 microlensing events found in the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) near-infrared (NIR) survey data. We obtain spatially-resolved, efficiency-corrected timescale distributions across the Galactic bulge ($|\ell|<10^\circ,$ $|b|<5^\circ$), using a Bayesian hierarchical model. Spatially-resolved peaks and means of the timescale distributions, along with their marginal distributions in strips of longitude and latitude, are in agreement at a 1$\sigma$ level with predictions based on the Besan\c{c}on model of the Galaxy. We find that the event timescales in the central bulge fields ($|\ell| < 5^\circ$) are on average shorter than the non-central ($|\ell| > 5^\circ$) fields, with the average peak of the lognormal timescale distribution at 23.6 $\pm$ 1.9 days for the central fields and 29.0 $\pm$ 3.0 days for the non-central fields. Our ability to probe the structure of the Bulge with this sample of NIR microlensing events is limited by the VVV survey's sparse cadence and relatively small number of detected microlensing events compared to dedicated optical surveys. Looking forward to future surveys, we investigate the capability of the Roman telescope to detect spatially-resolved asymmetries in the timescale distributions. We propose two pairs of Roman fields, centred on ($\ell = \pm 9,5^\circ$, $b=-0.125^\circ$) and ($\ell = -5^\circ$, $b=\pm 1.375^\circ$) as good targets to measure the asymmetry in longitude and latitude, respectively.
#### The Near-Infrared Extinction Law at High and Low Galactic Latitudes

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way extinction curve in the near-infrared (NIR) follows a power law form, but the value of the slope, $\beta_\text{NIR}$, is debated. Systematic variations in the slope of the Milky Way UV extinction curve are known to be correlated with variations in the optical slope (through $R_V$), but whether such a dependence extends to the NIR is unclear. Finally, because of low dust column densities, the NIR extinction law is essentially unconstrained at high Galactic latitudes where most extragalactic work takes place. In this paper, we construct extinction curves from 56,649 stars with SDSS and 2MASS photometry, based on stellar parameters from SDSS spectra. We use dust maps to identify dust-free stars, from which we calibrate the relation between stellar parameters and intrinsic colors. Furthermore, to probe the low-dust regime at high latitudes, we use aggregate curves based on many stars. We find no significant variation of $\beta_\text{NIR}$ across low-to-moderate dust columns ($0.02<E(B-V)\lesssim 1$), and report average $\beta_\text{NIR}=1.85\pm0.01$, in agreement with Fitzpatrick et al. (2019), but steeper than Cardelli et al. (1989) and Fitzpatrick (1999). We also find no intrinsic correlation between $\beta_\text{NIR}$ and $R_V$ (there is an apparent correlation which is the result of the correlated uncertainties in the two values). These results hold for typical sightlines; we do not probe very dusty regions near the Galactic Center, nor rare sightlines with $R_V>4$. Finally, we find $R_H=0.345\pm0.007$ and comment on its bearing on Cepheid calibrations and the determination of $H_0$.

 - **Abstract**
 A point-spread function describes the optics of an imaging system and can be used to correct collected images for instrumental effects. The state of the art for deconvolving images with the point-spread function is the Richardson-Lucy algorithm; however, despite its high fidelity, it is slow and cannot account for light scattered out of the field of view of the detector. We reinstate the Basic Iterative Deconvolution (BID) algorithm, a deconvolution algorithm that considers photons scattered out of the field of view of the detector, and extend it for image subregion deconvolutions. Its runtime is 1.8 to 7.1 faster than the Richardson-Lucy algorithm for 4096 x 4096 pixels images and up to an additional factor of 150 for subregions of 250 x 250 pixels. We test the extended BID algorithm for solar images taken by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), and find that the deviations between the reconstructed intensities of BID and the Richardson-Lucy algorithm are smaller than 1% + 0.1 DN.

 - **Abstract**
 Dozens of planets are now discovered with large orbital obliquity, and have become the proof for the dynamical evolution of planetary orbits. In the current samples, there is an apparent clustering of planets around $90^\circ$, and also an absence of planets around $180^\circ$ although the latter is expected by some theories. Statistical extrapolation using Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis have recently refuted the significant clustering around $90^\circ$ and suggested that the distribution may actually be broader. In this work, the symmetric TESS transit light curve of KELT-19Ab is analyzed using gravity darkening to measure its true obliquity. Its large sky projected obliquity $\lambda = -179.7^{\circ+3.7^\circ}_{\,\,-3.8^\circ}$ makes KELT-19Ab the only currently known planet with obliquity potentially close to $180^\circ$. We apply spectroscopic constraints on $v\mathrm{sin}i$ and $\lambda$ as well as theoretical constraints on the limb-darkening coefficients to find that the KELT-19Ab's obliquity is $\psi = 155^{\circ+17^\circ}_{\,\,-21^\circ}$, in favor of a flipped orbit. The result is consistent with the statistically inferred uniformity of obliquity distribution, and also highlights the applicability of the gravity darkening technique to symmetric light curves.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a future mission concept, the MeV Astrophysical Spectroscopic Surveyor (MASS), which is a large area Compton telescope using 3D position sensitive cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) detectors optimized for emission line detection. The payload consists of two layers of CZT detectors in a misaligned chessboard layout, with a total geometric area of 4096 cm$^2$ for on-axis observations. The detectors can be operated at room-temperature with an energy resolution of 0.6\% at 0.662 MeV. The in-orbit background is estimated with a mass model. At energies around 1 MeV, a line sensitivity of about $10^{-5}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ can be obtained with a 1 Ms observation. The main science objectives of MASS include nucleosynthesis in astrophysics and high energy astrophysics related to compact objects and transient sources. The payload CZT detectors weigh roughly 40 kg, suggesting that it can be integrated into a micro- or mini-satellite. We have constructed a pathfinder, named as MASS-Cube, to have a direct test of the technique with 4 detector units in space in the near future.
#### Anti-reflection coating with mullite and Duroid for large-diameter  cryogenic sapphire and alumina optics

 - **Abstract**
 We developed a broadband two-layer anti-reflection (AR) coating for use on a sapphire half-wave plate (HWP) and an alumina infrared (IR) filter for the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarimetry. Measuring the faint CMB B-mode signals requires maximizing the number of photons reaching the detectors and minimizing spurious polarization due to reflection with an off-axis incident angle. Sapphire and alumina have high refractive indices of 3.1 and are highly reflective without an AR coating. This paper presents the design, fabrication, quality control, and measured performance of an AR coating using thermally-sprayed mullite and Duroid 5880LZ. This technology enables large optical elements with diameters of 600 mm. We also present a newly developed thermography-based nondestructive quality control technique, which is key to assuring good adhesion and preventing delamination when thermal cycling. We demonstrate the average reflectance of about 2.6% (0.9%) for two observing bands centered at 90/150 (220/280) GHz. At room temperature, the average transmittance of a 105 mm square test sample at 220/280 GHz is 83%, and it will increase to 90% at 100 K, attributed to reduced absorption losses. Therefore, our developed layering technique has proved effective for 220/280 GHz applications, particularly in addressing dielectric loss concerns. This AR coating technology has been deployed in the cryogenic HWP and IR filters of the Simons Array and the Simons observatory experiments and applies to future experiments such as CMB-S4.

 - **Abstract**
 Transition disks have large central cavities that have been spatially resolved during recent years. Cavities and other substructures in circumstellar disks are often interpreted as signposts to massive companions. We aim to search for stellar and substellar companions in the central regions of transition disks. We want to determine if these disks might be circumbinary in their nature, similar to the HD 142527 system. We observed four systems, HD 100453, HD 100546, HD 135344 B, and PDS 70, with the sparse aperture masking mode of VLT/SPHERE. We extracted the complex visibilities and bispectra from the H2 and H3 imaging data. A binary model was fit to the closure phases to search for companions and estimate detection limits. For validation, we also analyzed four archival datasets of HD 142527 and inferred the orbital elements and atmospheric parameters of its low-mass stellar companion. We have not detected any significant point sources in the four observed systems. With a contrast sensitivity of $\approx$0.004, we can rule out stellar companions down to $\approx$2 au and partially explore the substellar regime at separations $\gtrsim$3-5 au. The analysis of HD 142527 B revealed that its projected orbit is aligned with dust features in the extended inner disk and that the orbit could be close to coplanar with the outer disk. Atmospheric modeling confirms the low-gravity and slightly reddened spectral appearance. The bulk parameters are in agreement with dynamical constraints and evolutionary tracks. In contrast to HD 142527, we find no evidence that a close-in stellar companion is responsible for the resolved disk features of HD 100453, HD 100546, HD 135344 B, and PDS 70. Instead, the formation of giant planets or even low-mass brown dwarfs could be shaping the innermost environment ($\lesssim$20 au) of these circumstellar disks, as is the case with the planetary system of PDS 70.
#### Pulsation modelling of the Cepheid Y Ophiuchi with RSP/MESA. Impact of  the circumstellar envelope and a high projection factor on Baade-Wesselink  method

 - **Abstract**
 Y~Ophiuchi (Y~Oph) is a classical Cepheid reported to be as dim as a Cepheid of about half its pulsation period, and exhibits a low radial velocity and light-curves amplitude. Our objective is to conduct hydrodynamical pulsation modeling of Y~Oph to derive its distance and provide physical insight to its low amplitude and luminosity, constrained by an extensive set of observations. We first perform a linear analysis on a grid of models using hydrodynamical pulsation code \texttt{MESA-RSP} in order to find the combinations of mass, metallicity, effective temperature and luminosity resulting in linear excitation of pulsations with period of about 17$\,$days. Then, for the best combinations of stellar parameters, we perform non-linear computations to obtain the full-amplitude pulsations of these models. Last, we compare the results to a complete set of observations along the pulsation cycle. We adjust simultaneously the distance, the color excess and circumstellar envelope (CSE) model to fit the light curves and the angular diameter. We find that all pulsation models at high effective temperature are in remarkable agreement with the observations along the pulsation cycle. This result suggests that the low amplitude of Y~Oph can be explained by its location close to the blue edge of the instability strip. We also find that a pulsational mass of about 7-8$\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ is consistent with a non-canonical evolutionary model with moderate overshooting, PL relation and \textit{Gaia} parallax. However, a much lower mass below 5$\,$M$_\odot$ is required to match Baade-Wesselink (BW) distance measurements from the literature. We show that the combination of the impact of the CSE on the photometry together with a projection factor of about 1.5 explains the discrepant distance and luminosity values obtained from BW methods.
#### The distribution of impactor core material during large impacts on  Earth-like planets

 - **Abstract**
 Large impacts onto young rocky planets may transform their compositions, creating highly reducing conditions at their surfaces and reintroducing highly siderophile metals to their mantles. Key to these processes is the availability of an impactor's chemically reduced core material (metallic iron). It is, therefore, important to constrain how much of an impactor's core remains accessible to a planet's mantle/surface, how much is sequestered to its core, and how much escapes. Here, we present 3D simulations of such impact scenarios using the shock physics code iSALE to determine the fate of impactor iron. iSALE's inclusion of material strength is vital in capturing the behavior of both solid and fluid components of the planet and thus characterizing iron sequestration to the core. We find that the mass fractions of impactor core material that accretes to the planet core ($f_{core}$) or escapes ($f_{esc}$) can be readily parameterized as a function of a modified specific impact energy, with $f_{core} > f_{esc}$ for a wide set of impacts. These results differ from previous works that do not incorporate material strength. Our work shows that large impacts can place substantial reducing impactor core material in the mantles of young rocky planets. Impact-generated reducing atmospheres may thus be common for such worlds. However, through escape and sequestration to a planet's core, large fractions of an impactor's core can be geochemically hidden from a planet's mantle. Consequently, geochemical estimates of late bombardments of planets based on mantle siderophile element abundances may be underestimates.

 - **Abstract**
 With the enhancement of sensitivity of Gravitational Wave (GW) detectors and capabilities of large survey facilities, such as Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and 2.5-m Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST), we now have the potential to detect an increasing number of distant kilonova (KN). However, distinguishing KN from the plethora of detected transients in ongoing and future follow-up surveys presents a significant challenge. In this study, our objective is to establish an efficient classification mechanism tailored for the follow-up survey conducted by WFST, with a specific focus on identifying KN associated with GW. We employ a novel temporal convolutional neural network architecture, trained using simulated multi-band photometry lasting for 3 days by WFST, accompanied by contextual information, i.e. luminosity distance information by GW. By comparison of the choices of contextual information, we can reach 95\% precision, and 94\% recall for our best model. It also performs good validation on photometry data on AT2017gfo and AT2019npv. Furthermore, we investigate the ability of the model to distinguish KN in a GW follow-up survey. We conclude that there is over 80\% probability that we can capture true KN in selected 20 candidates among $\sim 250$ detected astrophysical transients that have passed real-bogus filter and cross-matching.

 The Large Latin American Millimeter Array (LLAMA for short) is a joint scientific and technological undertaking of Argentina and Brazil whose goal is to install and to operate an observing facility capable of performing observations of the Universe at millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths. It will consist of a 12m ALMA-like antenna with the addition of two Nasmyth cabins. LLAMA is located at 4850m above sea level in the Puna Saltenia, in the northwest region of Argentina. When completed, LLAMA will be equipped with six ALMA receivers covering Bands 1, 2+3, 5, 6, 7, and 9, which will populate the two Nasmyth cabins. We summarize here the main ideas related with the Science that LLAMA could accomplish on different astronomical topics, gathered from the experience of a group of international experts on each field.

 - **Abstract**
 Deuterated molecules are valuable probes for investigating the evolution and the kinematics in the earliest stages of star formation. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive investigation by performing a single point survey of 101 starless clump candidates, and carrying out on-the-fly (OTF) observations of 11 selected sources, focusing on deuterated molecular lines using the IRAM 30-m telescope. In the single-point observation, we make 46 detections for DCO$^{+}$ J=1$-$0, 12 for DCN J=1$-$0, 51 for DNC J=1$-$0, 7 for N$_{2}$D$^{+}$ J=1$-$0, 20 for DCO$^{+}$ J=2$-$1, and 10 for DCN J=2$-$1. The starless clump candidates (SCCs) with deuterated molecule detections exhibit lower median kinetic temperatures and narrower H$_{2}$CO (1$_{(0,1)}$$-$0$_{(0,0)}$) median full width at half maximum (FWHM) compared to those without such detections, while simultaneously displaying similar median values of 1.1mm intensity, mass, and distance. Furthermore, our OTF observations reveal that deuterated molecules predominantly have peaks near the 1.1mm continuum peaks, with the DCO$^{+}$ J=1$-$0 emission demonstrating higher intensity in the deuterated peak region compared to the DCN and DNC J=1$-$0 emissions. Additionally, the majority of emissions from deuterated molecules and $^{13}$C$-$isotopologues exhibit peak positions close to those of the 1.1mm continuum peaks. By analyzing the 20"$\times$20" regions with strongest deuterated emissions in the OTF observations, we estimated deuterated abundances of 0.004$-$0.045, 0.011$-$0.040, and 0.004$-$0.038 for D$_{\rm frac}$(HCN), D$_{\rm frac}$(HCO$^{+}$), and D$_{\rm frac}$(HNC), respectively. The differential detection of deuterated molecular lines in our OTF observations could be attributed to variations in critical densities and formation pathways.

 - **Abstract**
 The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) started observing the extremely powerful long-duration gamma-ray burst, GRB 221009A, after 53 hours of the triggering event. The H.E.S.S. collaboration carried out observations on the 11, 12, and 17, of October 2022 under poor atmospheric conditions, without detecting significant very high-energy photons from the source and computed the upper limits of the fluxes for the different nights. We study these flux upper limits by using the photohadronic model and show that the interaction of high-energy protons with the synchrotron seed photons in the forward shock region of the GRB jet exhibits behavior compatible with the upper limits computed by the H.E.S.S. collaboration.

 - **Abstract**
 Natural inflation is a well-motivated model for the early universe in which an inflaton potential of the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone form, $V(\phi) = \Lambda^4[1 + \cos{(\phi/f)}]$, can naturally drive a cosmic accelerated epoch. This paper investigates the observational viability of the minimally and non-minimally coupled natural inflation scenarios in light of current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. We find that a small and negative coupling of the field with gravity can alleviate the well-known observational discrepancies of the minimally coupled model. We perform a Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis of the Planck 2018 CMB and BICEP/Keck Array B-mode polarization data to estimate how strong the coupling $\xi$ should be to achieve concordance with data. We also briefly discuss the impact of these results on the physical interpretation of the natural inflation scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the nature of dark matter is among the top priorities of modern physics. However, due to its inertness, it is very difficult to detect and study it directly in terrestrial experiments. Numerical N-body simulations are currently the best approach to study the particle properties and phase space distribution, by assuming the collisionless nature of dark matter particles. These simulations also compensate for the fact that we do not have a satisfactory theory for predicting the universal properties of dark matter halos, such as the density profile and velocity distribution. In this work, we propose a new analytical model of dark matter phase space distribution that could provide a NFW-like density profile and velocity distribution, as well as velocity component distributions, which agree very well with the simulation data. Our model is relevant both for theoretical modelling of dark matter distributions, as well as for underground detector experiments, which need the dark matter velocity distribution for the experimental analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 The elemental abundances between strontium and silver ($Z = 38-47$) observed in the atmospheres of very metal-poor stars (VMP) in the Galaxy may contain the fingerprint of the weak $r$-process and $\nu p$-process occurring in early core-collapse supernovae explosions. In this work, we combine various astrophysical conditions based on a steady-state model to cover the richness of the supernova ejecta in terms of entropy, expansion timescale, and electron fraction. The calculated abundances based on different combinations of conditions are compared with stellar observations with the aim of constraining supernova ejecta conditions. We find that some conditions of the neutrino-driven outflows consistently reproduce the observed abundances of our sample. In addition, from the successful combinations, the neutron-rich trajectories better reproduce the observed abundances of Sr-Zr ($Z= 38-40$), while the proton-rich ones, Mo-Pd ($Z= 42-47$).

 - **Abstract**
 Can a machine or algorithm discover or learn the elliptical orbit of Mars from astronomical sightings alone? Johannes Kepler required two paradigm shifts to discover his First Law regarding the elliptical orbit of Mars. Firstly, a shift from the geocentric to the heliocentric frame of reference. Secondly, the reduction of the orbit of Mars from a three- to a two-dimensional space. We extend AI Feynman, a physics-inspired tool for symbolic regression, to discover the heliocentricity and planarity of Mars' orbit and emulate his discovery of Kepler's first law.

 We present the result of a sample of B-stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud young double stellar cluster NGC 1850 A and NGC 1850 B, observed with the integral-field spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope, the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer. We compare the observed equivalent widths (EWs) of four He lines (4922 $\mathring{\mathrm A}$, 5015 $\mathring{\mathrm A}$, 6678 $\mathring{\mathrm A}$, and 7065 $\mathring{\mathrm A}$) with the ones determined from synthetic spectra computed with different He mass fraction (Y=0.25, 0.27, 0.30 and 0.35) with the code SYNSPEC, that takes into account the non-LTE effect. From this comparison, we determined the He mass fraction of the B stars, finding a not homogeneous distribution. The stars can be divided in three groups, He-weak (Y $\lt$ 0.24) and the He-normal (0.24 $\leqslant$ Y $\leqslant$ 0.26) belonging to the MS of NGC 1850 A, and the He-rich stars (0.33 $\leqslant$ Y $\leqslant$ 0.38) situated in the MS associated to NGC 1850 B. We have analyzed the stellar rotation as possible responsible of the anomalous features of the He lines in the He-rich stars. We provide a simple analysis of the differences between the observed EWs and the ones obtained from the theoretical models with different rotation velocity (V$\sin{i}$ = 0 and 250 Km/s). The resolution of the MUSE spectra do not allow to get a conclusive result, however our analysis support the He-enhanced hypothesis.

 - **Abstract**
 The statistical characteristic of stellar flares at optical bands has received an extensive study, but it remains to be studied at soft X-ray bands, in particular for solar-type stars. Here, we present a statistical study of soft X-ray flares on solar-type stars, which can help understand multi-wavelength behaviors of stellar flares. We mainly use Chandra Source Catalog Release 2.0, which includes a number of flaring stars with denoted variability, and Gaia Data Release 3, which includes necessary information for classifying stars. We also develop a set of methods for identifying and classifying stellar soft X-ray flares and estimating their properties. A detailed statistical investigation for 129 flare samples on 103 nearby solar-type stars as selected yields the following main results. (1) The flare energy emitted at the soft X-ray band in our sample ranges from $\sim 10^{33}$ to $\sim 10^{37} \ \mathrm{erg}$, and the majority of them are superflares with the most energetic one having energy of $6.0_{-4.7}^{+3.2} \times 10^{37} \ \mathrm{erg}$. (2) The flare duration is related to its energy as formulated by $T_\mathrm{duration,SXR} \propto E_\mathrm{flare,SXR}^{\ 0.201 \pm 0.024}$, which is different from those derived at optical and NIR bands, indicating distinct radiation mechanisms at different bands. (3) The frequency distribution of stellar flares as a function of energy is formulated as $\mathrm{d} N_\mathrm{flare} / \mathrm{d} E_\mathrm{flare,SXR} \propto E_\mathrm{flare,SXR}^{\ -1.77}$, which is similar to the results found at other bands and on other types of stars, indicating that the energy emitted at the soft X-ray band could be a constant fraction of the full-band bolometric energy.
#### The Hubble tension as a window on the gravitation of the dark matter  sector: exploration of a family of models

 - **Abstract**
 A family of simple and minimal extensions of the standard cosmological $\Lambda$CDM model in which dark matter experiences an additional long-range scalar interaction is demonstrated to alleviate the long lasting Hubble-tension while letting primordial nucleosynthesis predictions unaffected and passing by construction all current local tests of general relativity. This article describes their theoretical formulation and their implications for dark matter. Then, it investigates their cosmological signatures, both at the background and perturbation levels. A detailed comparison to astrophysical data is performed to discuss their ability to fit existing data. A thorough discussion of the complementarity of the low- and high-redshift data and on their constraining power highlights how these models improve the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model whatever the combination of datasets used and why they can potentially resolve the Hubble tension. Being fully predictive in any environment, they pave the way to a better understanding of gravity in the dark matter sector.

 - **Abstract**
 In inflationary models that produce a spike of power on short scales, back-reaction of small-scale substructure onto large-scale modes is enhanced. We argue that the separate universe framework provides a highly convenient tool to compute loop corrections that quantify this back-reaction. Each loop of interest is characterized by large hierarchies in wavenumber and horizon exit time. The separate universe framework highlights important factorizations involving these hierarchies. We interpret each loop correction in terms of a simple, classical, back-reaction model, and clarify the meaning of the different volume scalings that have been reported in the literature. We argue that significant back-reaction requires both short-scale nonlinearities and long-short couplings that modulate the short-scale power spectrum. In the absence of long-short couplings, only incoherent shot noise-like effects are present, which are volume-suppressed. Dropping the shot noise, back-reaction from a particular scale is controlled by a product of $f_{NL}$-like parameters: an equilateral configuration measuring the nonlinearity of the short-scale modes, and a squeezed configuration measuring the long-short coupling. These may carry important scale dependence controlling the behaviour of the loop in the decoupling limit where the hierarchy of scales becomes large. In single-field models the long-short coupling may be suppressed by this hierarchy, in which case the net back-reaction would be safely suppressed. We illustrate our framework using explicit computations in a 3-phase ultra-slow-roll scenario. Finally, we discuss different choices for the smoothing scale used in the separate universe framework and argue the effect can be absorbed into a renormalization of local operators.
