 - **Abstract**
 The Observatorio Astrofísico de Javalambre (OAJ) is a Spanish astronomical ICTS (Unique Scientific and Technical Infrastructures) located in the Sierra de Javalambre in Teruel (Spain). It has been particularly conceived for carrying out large-sky multi-filter surveys. As an ICTS, the OAJ offers Open Time to the astronomical community, offering more than 25% through Legacy Surveys, Regular Programs (RP) and Director discretionary time (DDT). Regarding the RP, a new call for proposals is made public each semester accepting only proposals under the modality of Target of Opportunity (ToO). This contribution summarizes how ToOs are managed at OAJ presenting the different applications designed and implemented at the observatory to deal with them: the Proposal Preparation portal (to request observing time), the Phase2 Observing tool and the submitphase2 web service (to trigger the ToOs), the TAC Tracking portal (for telescope operators to support the observations) and the TACData portal (to publish and offer the images and their data products).

          The bright, dusty aftermath of giant eruptions & H-rich supernovae. Late interaction of supernova shocks & dusty circumstellar shells

 - **Abstract**
 The late-stage evolution of massive stars is marked by intense instability as they approach core-collapse. During these phases, giant stellar eruptions lead to exceptionally high mass-loss rates, forming significant amounts of dust. However, the survival of these dust grains is challenged by the powerful shock waves generated when the progenitor explodes as a supernova (SN). We explore the impact of hydrogen-rich SN explosions from 45, 50, and 60 M$_\odot$ progenitors on dust formed after these eruptions, focusing on interactions with circumstellar shells occurring from a few years to centuries after the event. Using 3D hydrodynamical simulations, we track the evolution of dust particles in a scenario that includes the progenitor's stellar wind, a giant eruption, and the subsequent SN explosion, following the mass budgets predicted by stellar evolution models. For a standard SN ejecta mass of 10 M$_\odot$ and kinetic energy of $10^{51}$ erg, only 25% of the dust mass survives 250 years post-explosion in a spherical circumstellar medium (CSM), while merely 2% remains a century after the explosion in a bipolar CSM. If the SN follows the eruption within a dozen years, 75% of the dust survives for a standard explosion, dropping to 20% for more massive ejecta (15-20 M$_\odot$) with kinetic energy of $5 \times 10^{51}$ erg. The geometry of the CSM and the early transition of the SN remnant into a radiative phase significantly influence dust survival. As the shock wave weakens and efficiently converts kinetic energy into thermal radiation (up to half of the injected kinetic energy) the likelihood of dust survival increases, affecting not only pre-existing dust in the CSM but also SN-condensed dust and ambient interstellar dust. Contrary to expectations, a larger fraction of the dust mass can survive if the SN occurs only a few years after the eruption.

          Habitable Zone and Atmosphere Retention Distance (HaZARD) Stellar-evolution-dependent loss models of secondary atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 A major open question in exoplanet research is whether secondary atmospheres are rare around Earth-sized rocky exoplanets. In this work we determine the distance at which an Earth-sized planet orbiting a variety of stellar hosts could retain a CO2- or N2-dominated atmosphere and compare this atmospheric retention distance (ARD) with that of the liquid-water HZ. We combined planetary atmosphere models with stellar evolution models. The atmospheric models produced by the thermochemical Kompot code allowed us to calculate the Jeans escape rates for different stellar masses, rotation rates, and ages. These loss rates allowed us to determine the closest distance a planet is likely to retain a CO2- or N2-dominated atmosphere. Using stellar rotation evolution models, we modelled how these retention distances evolve as the X-ray and ultraviolet activity of the star evolves. We find that the overlap of the HZ and the ARD occurs earlier around slowly rotating stars. Additionally, we find that HZ planets orbiting stars with masses under 0.4 M_\odot are unlikely to retain any atmosphere, due to the lower spin-down rate of these fully convective stars. We also show that the initial rotation rate of the star can impact the likelihood of a planet retaining an atmosphere, as an initially fast-rotating star maintains high levels of short-wavelength irradiance for much longer. The orbits of all Earth-like rocky exoplanets observed by JWST in cycles 1 and 2, including HZ planets, fall outside the ARD. Our results will have implications for future target selections of small exoplanet observing programmes with JWST or future instruments such as the Ariel space mission.

 - **Abstract**
 We assess the impact of CaII 3934,3969 and NaI 5891,5897 absorption arising in the interstellar medium (ISM) on the SDSS-IV MaNGA Stellar Library (MaStar) and produce corrected spectroscopy for 80% of the 24,162-star catalog. We model the absorption strength of these transitions as a function of stellar distance, Galactic latitude, and dust reddening based upon high-spectral resolution studies. With this model, we identify 6342 MaStar stars that have negligible ISM absorption ($W^\mathrm{ISM}$(CaII K) $<0.07$ Ang and $W^\mathrm{ISM}$(NaI 5891) $<0.05$ Ang). For 12,110 of the remaining stars, we replace their NaI D profile (and their CaII profile for effective temperatures $T_{\rm eff}>9000$ K) with a coadded spectrum of low-ISM stars with similar $T_{\rm eff}$, surface gravity, and metallicity. For 738 additional stars with $T_{\rm eff}>9000$ K, we replace these spectral regions with a matching ATLAS9-based BOSZ model. This results in a mean reduction in $W$(CaII K) ($W$(NaI D)) of $0.4-0.7$ Ang ($0.6-1.1$ Ang) for hot stars ($T_{\rm eff}>7610$ K), and a mean reduction in $W$(NaI D) of $0.1-0.2$ Ang for cooler stars. We show that interstellar absorption in simple stellar population (SSP) model spectra constructed from the original library artificially enhances $W$(CaII K) by $\gtrsim20\%$ at young ages ($<400$ Myr); dramatically enhances the strength of stellar NaI D in starbursting systems (by ${\gtrsim}50\%$); and enhances stellar NaI D in older stellar populations (${\gtrsim}10$ Gyr) by ${\gtrsim}10\%$. We provide SSP spectra constructed from the cleaned library, and discuss the implications of these effects for stellar population synthesis analyses constraining stellar age, [Na/Fe] abundance, and the initial mass function.

          Cosmological information content of Betti curves and $k$-nearest neighbor distributions

 - **Abstract**
 We compare the cosmological constraints that can be obtained from halo clustering on non-linear scales ($2 h^{-1}$ Mpc < $r$ < $50 h^{-1}$ Mpc) using Betti curves, a topological summary statistic, and $k$-th nearest neighbor ($k$NN) distributions. We quantify the information content of each summary statistic through Fisher matrices computed from the Quijote simulations. Due to the use of simulation-based Fisher forecasts, we pay careful attention to the convergence of the Fisher matrices by looking at their eigendecompositions. We find that, in general, only two directions in the parameter space have constraints that are well converged given the number of Quijote simulations available. We then compare the information content of each summary statistic in the reduced parameter space $\{\Omega_m, \sigma_8\}$. We find that almost all of the information present in the Betti curves comes from the first two, $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, which track the number of connected components and one-dimensional loops respectively, and almost no constraining power comes from $\beta_2$ which tracks the number of topological voids. In comparison, we find that the $k$NNs provide very competitive constraints along with several potential advantages in regards to real data. Finally, we find that while the $k$NNs and Betti curves provide some complementary constraints, they are not fully independent, potentially indicating a connection between the two statistics.

          The Pristine survey: XXVIII. The extremely metal-poor stream C-19 stretches over more than 100 degrees

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of the most metal-poor stream, C-19, provides us with a fossil record of a stellar structure born very soon after the Big Bang. In this work, we search for new C-19 members over the whole sky by combining two complementary stream-searching algorithms, STREAMFINDER and StarGO,, and utilizing low-metallicity star samples from the Pristine survey as well as Gaia BP/RP spectro-photometric catalogues. We confirm twelve new members, spread over more than 100$^\circ$, using velocity and metallicity information from a set of spectroscopic follow-up programs that targeted a quasi-complete sample of our bright candidates ($G \lesssim 16.0$). From the updated set of stream members, we confirm that the stream is wide, with a stream width of $\sim200$ pc, and dynamically hot, with a derived velocity dispersion of $11.1^{+1.9}_{-1.6}$ km/s. The tension remains between these quantities and a purely baryonic scenario in which the relatively low-mass stream (even updated to a few $10^4M_{\odot}$) stems from a globular cluster progenitor, as suggested by its chemical abundances. Some heating mechanism, such as preheating of the cluster in its own dark matter halo or through interactions with halo sub-structures appears necessary to explain the tension. The impact of binaries on the measured dispersion also remains unknown. Detailed elemental abundances of more stream members as well as multi-epoch radial velocities from spectroscopic observations are therefore crucial to fully understand the nature and past history of the most metal-poor stream of the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroid 2024 XA$_1$ was discovered on 3 December 2024 at 05:54 UTC by the Bok telescope in Kitt Peak, Arizona, and impacted Earth about 10 hours later over a remote area of the Sakha Republic (Russia). The estimated size of the object was about one meter, and the atmospheric entry produced a bright fireball that was captured by a webcam and several eyewitnesses. The first impact alert was issued at 07:50 UTC by the Meerkat Asteroid Guard of the European Space Agency, which triggered subsequent follow-up observations that confirmed both the object to be real and the occurrence of the impact with Earth. Here we present the operations and results from the NEO Coordination Centre (NEOCC) upon the impact event. Because the entry likely dropped meteorites on the ground, we also estimate the possible strewn fields for future meteorite search campaigns.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are a key probe in modern cosmology, as they can be used to measure luminosity distances at gigaparsec scales. Models of their light-curves are used to project heterogeneous observed data onto a common basis for analysis. The SALT model currently used for SN Ia cosmology describes SNe as having two sources of variability, accounted for by a color parameter c, and a "stretch parameter" x1. We extend the model to include an additional parameter we label x2, to investigate the cosmological impact of currently unaddressed light-curve variability. We construct a new SALT model, which we dub "SALT3+". This model was trained by an improved version of the SALTshaker code, using training data combining a selection of the second data release of cosmological SNe Ia from the Zwicky Transient Facility and the existing SALT3 training compilation. We find additional, coherent variability in supernova light-curves beyond SALT3. Most of this variation can be described as phase-dependent variation in g-r and r-i color curves, correlated with a boost in the height of the secondary maximum in i-band. These behaviors correlate with spectral differences, particularly in line velocity. We find that fits with the existing SALT3 model tend to address this excess variation with the color parameter, leading to less informative measurements of supernova color. We find that neglecting the new parameter in light-curve fits leads to a trend in Hubble residuals with x2 of 0.039 +/- 0.005 mag, representing a potential systematic uncertainty. However, we find no evidence of a bias in current cosmological measurements. We conclude that extended SN Ia light-curve models promise mild improvement in the accuracy of color measurements, and corresponding cosmological precision. However, models with more parameters are unlikely to substantially affect current cosmological results.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pandora SmallSat is a NASA flight project aimed at studying the atmospheres of exoplanets -- planets orbiting stars outside our Solar System. Pandora will provide the first dataset of simultaneous, multiband (visible and NIR), long-baseline observations of exoplanets and their host stars. Pandora is an ambitious project that will fly a 0.44 m telescope in a small form factor. To achieve the scientific goals, the mission requires a departure from the traditional cost-schedule paradigm of half-meter-class observatories. Pandora achieves this by leveraging existing capabilities that necessitate minimal engineering development, disruptive and agile management, trusted partnerships with vendors, and strong support from the lead institutions. The Pandora team has developed a suite of high-fidelity parameterized simulation and modeling tools to estimate the performance of both imaging channels. This has enabled a unique bottom-up approach to deriving trades and system requirements. Pandora is a partnership between NASA and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The project completed its Critical Design Review in October 2023 and is slated for launch into Sun-synchronous, low-Earth orbit in Fall 2025.

          Gravitational Effects of a Small Primordial Black Hole Passing Through the Human Body

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational effects of a primordial black hole (PBH) passing through the human body are examined, with the goal of determining the minimum mass necessary to produce significant injury or death. Two effects are examined: the damage caused by a shock wave propagating outward from the black hole trajectory, and the dissociation of brain cells from tidal forces produced by the black hole on its passage through the human body. It is found that the former is the dominant effect, with a cutoff mass for serious injury or death of approximately $M_{PBH} > 1.4 \times 10^{17} {\rm g}$. The number density of primordial black holes with a mass above this cutoff is far too small to produce any observable effects on the human population.

          Long-rising Type II supernovae resembling supernova 1987A - II. A new analytical model to describe these events

 - **Abstract**
 With the aim of improving our knowledge on supernova (SN) 1987A-like objects and, more in general, on H-rich SNe, we have developed a new analytic model to describe their post-explosive evolution. The distinctive features of this model are the possibility to evaluate the emitted luminosity and the SN expansion velocity, taking into account the recombination of the ejected material, the heating effects due to the \chem{56}{Ni} decay in the computation of the recombination front position, and the presence of an outer thin shell not-homologously expanding. In this paper, we present the model and a comparison with observations of SN 1987A, showing that its bolometric light curve and expansion velocity are accurately reproduced by the model. We also investigate the modeling degeneration problem in H-rich SNe and the possibility to ``standardize'' the subgroup of SN 1987A-like objects. Moreover we present new Ni-dependent relationships, based on our model, which link some features of the bolometric light curve of 1987A-like SNe (namely, the peak luminosity and its width) with the main physical properties of their progenitor at the explosion (i.e.~the ejected mass, the explosion energy, the progenitor radius at the explosion, and the amount of \chem{56}{Ni} present in the ejecta), showing that such relations are in excellent agreement with observations of real SNe. From our model, we also deduce new scaling relations which may be used for estimating the main SN progenitor's physical properties at the explosion, once only the photometric behaviour of the SN 1987A-like object is known.

          Swift-XRT and NuSTAR Monitoring of Obscuration Variability in Mrk 477

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of 15 X-ray observations of Mrk 477, a nearby Seyfert 2 active galactic nucleus, with the objective to monitor its obscuring column density variability. The full dataset consists of five archival observations, split into two XMM-Newton, two NuSTAR and one Chandra observation, plus two dedicated monitoring campaigns. The monitoring campaigns were performed with Swift-XRT and NuSTAR, containing five observations each. We performed a simultaneous analysis using self-consistent torus models, deriving geometric properties of the torus as well as the obscuration along the line of sight. Mrk 477 is best modeled with a torus with large covering factor yet low column density (on average). Its line of sight column density oscillates between $1.5-7\times10^{23}$~cm$^{-2}$. Mrk~477 presents frequent obscuring column density variability, on timescales as short as $\sim2$~weeks. The probability of drawing a pair of obscuration-variable observations for Mrk~477 when having 2, 3, and 4 observations is 40\%, 78\% and 95\%, respectively. Adding the results of this work to those of another 26 sources, we find a trend of increasing obscuration variability with time (from $\sim20$\% at $\Delta t<10$~days, to $\sim60-70$\% at timescales larger than 5 years). We discuss whether this is compatible with the majority of obscuration variability coming from broad line region clouds.

          $Λ$CDM and early dark energy in latent space: a data-driven parametrization of the CMB temperature power spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 Finding the best parametrization for cosmological models in the absence of first-principle theories is an open question. We propose a data-driven parametrization of cosmological models given by the disentangled 'latent' representation of a variational autoencoder (VAE) trained to compress cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature power spectra. We consider a broad range of $\Lambda$CDM and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cosmologies with an additional early dark energy (EDE) component. We show that these spectra can be compressed into 5 ($\Lambda$CDM) or 8 (EDE) independent latent parameters, as expected when using temperature power spectra alone, and which reconstruct spectra at an accuracy well within the Planck errors. These latent parameters have a physical interpretation in terms of well-known features of the CMB temperature spectrum: these include the position, height and even-odd modulation of the acoustic peaks, as well as the gravitational lensing effect. The VAE also discovers one latent parameter which entirely isolates the EDE effects from those related to $\Lambda$CDM parameters, thus revealing a previously unknown degree of freedom in the CMB temperature power spectrum. We further showcase how to place constraints on the latent parameters using Planck data as typically done for cosmological parameters, obtaining latent values consistent with previous $\Lambda$CDM and EDE cosmological constraints. Our work demonstrates the potential of a data-driven reformulation of current beyond-$\Lambda$CDM phenomenological models into the independent degrees of freedom to which the data observables are sensitive.

          Structure of gaps induced by retrograde satellites embedded in accretion discs

 - **Abstract**
 Using 2D simulations, we investigate how a non-accreting satellite on a fixed retrograde circular orbit affects the structure of the accretion disc in which it is embedded. We vary the satellite-to-primary mass ratio $q$, the disc viscosity $\nu$, and the inner boundary conditions. A viscous criterion for gap opening is derived, which is broadly consistent with the simulations. We find a scaling relation of the gap depth with $q$ and $\nu$. Unlike the prograde case, the satellite is located at the gap's inner edge, resulting in a surface density at the satellite's orbital radius up to $20$ times higher than at the gap's minimum. As the viscosity decreases, the gap depth increases, while the radial shift of the gap and the satellite's orbital radius decreases. Gap-opening satellites may drive radial motions in the disc, producing eccentric gaps. Positioned at the gap edge, satellites experience a rapidly fluctuating environment. Migrating satellites can develop orbital eccentricities comparable to the disc's aspect ratio. In a 3D simulation with $q=0.01$, the flow velocity exhibits a notorious vertical component in the gap's inner edge. A comparison between 2D and 3D simulations reveals a slight radial offset in gap position, resulting in a lower surface density at the perturber's orbital radius in the 3D simulation.

 Context. (3200) Phaethon is a ~5-km-diameter near-Earth asteroid with a small perihelion distance of 0.14 au and is the parent body of the Geminids. JAXA's DESTINY+ mission will fly by Phaethon in the near future. Aims. We aim to support the pre-flight planning for the DESTINY+ mission by performing a geophysical analysis on Phaethon's surface and near-surface environment utilizing the latest shape model from numerous observations. Methods. We employed the soft-sphere discrete element method code PKDGRAV to construct a "mascon" model of Phaethon and determine its gravity. We then computed the geopotential on Phaethon and derived various physical quantities related to its surface and near-surface dynamics. Results. We calculated geophysical quantities for the surface, including surface acceleration and slope. To assess whether surface objects could be launched off the surface, we computed the escape speed, return speed, Jacobi speed, and the location and stability of equilibrium points around Phaethon, and conducted a simple dynamical simulation of launched particles. Conclusions. Our results suggest that a large depression feature in the northern hemisphere could harbor exposed subsurface material and the freshest material on Phaethon. We propose that this depression be considered a key area for observation by the DESTINY+ mission

 - **Abstract**
 Simulated images are essential in algorithm development and instrument testing for optical telescopes. During real observations, images obtained by optical telescopes are affected by spatially variable point spread functions (PSFs), a crucial effect requiring accurate simulation. Traditional methods segment images into patches, convolve patches with individual PSFs, and reassemble them as a whole image. Although widely used, these approaches suffer from slow convolution processes and reduced image fidelity due to abrupt PSF transitions between different patches. This paper introduces a novel method for generating simulated images with spatial continuously varying PSFs. Our approach firstly decomposes original images into PSF bases derived with the principal component analysis method. The entire image is then convolved with these PSF bases to create image bases. Finally, we multiply the coefficients of image bases with these image bases for each pixels and add the multiplication results along each pixel to obtain the final simulated image. Our method could generate high-fidelity simulated images with spatially variable PSFs without boundary artifacts. The method proposed in this paper significantly improves the speed of astronomical image simulation, potentially advancing observational astronomy and instrumental development.

          Probing solar modulation of AMS-02 time-dependent D, $^3$He and $^4$He fluxes with modified force field approximation

 - **Abstract**
 The AMS-02 experiment recently published time-dependent fluxes of deuterons (D) from May 2011 to April 2021, divided into 33 periods of four Bartels rotations each. These temporal structures are associated with solar modulation. In this study, three modified force-field approximation are employed to examine the long-term behavior of cosmic-ray (CR) isotopes such as deuteron, $^3$He, and $^4$He, as well as the ratios D/$^3$He and $^3$He/$^4$He. The solar modulation potential is rigidity-dependent for these modified force-field approximation. Due to the unknown local interstellar spectrum (LIS) for these isotopes, we utilize the Non-LIS method for solar modulation. By fitting to the AMS-02 time-dependent fluxes, we derive the solar modulation parameters. Our findings indicate that all isotopes can be fitted using the same parameters. Thus, the time-independent behavior of the flux ratio at low energy primarily arises from differences in the LIS and the conversion between kinetic energy and rigidity for cosmic rays with varying Z/A ratios. Based on these, we forecast the daily fluxes of D, $^3$He and $^4$He.

 - **Abstract**
 In binary neutron star mergers, lanthanide-rich dynamical ejecta and lanthanide-poor post-merger ejecta have been often linked to the red and blue kilonova emission, respectively. However, analytic light curve modeling of kilonova often results in the ejecta parameters that are at odds with such expectations. To investigate the physical meaning of the derived parameters, we perform analytic modeling of the kilonova light curves calculated with realistic multi-dimensional radiative transfer based on the numerical relativity simulations. Our fiducial simulations adopt a faster-moving, less massive dynamical ejecta and slower-moving, more massive post-merger ejecta. The results of analytic modeling, however, show that the inferred ''red'' component is more massive and slower, while the ''blue'' component is less massive and faster, as also inferred for GW170817/AT2017gfo. This suggests that the parameters derived from light curve modeling with an analytic model do not represent the true configuration of the kilonova ejecta. We demonstrate that the post-merger ejecta contributes to both blue and red emissions: the emission from the post-merger ejecta is absorbed and reprocessed to red emission by the dynamical ejecta with a higher lanthanide fraction. Our results caution against separately discussing the origins of red and blue components derived from the analytic models. Despite of the challenges in the parameter estimation, we show that the estimate of the total ejecta mass is rather robust within a factor of a few, reflecting the total luminosity output. To derive the reliable total ejecta mass, multi-epoch observations in near-infrared wavelengths near their light curve peaks are important.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrochemical models of interstellar clouds, the sites of stars, and planet formation require information about spin-state chemistry to allow quantitative comparison with spectroscopic observations. In particular, it is important to know if full scrambling or H abstraction (also known as proton hopping) takes place in ion-neutral reactions. The reaction of Cl+ and HCl+ with H2 and isotopologues has been studied at cryogenic temperatures between 20 and 180 K using a 22 pole radio frequency ion trap. Isotopic exchange processes are used to probe the reaction mechanism of the HCl+ + H2 reaction. The results are compared with previous measurements and theoretical predictions. The rate coefficients for the Cl+ + H2 and HCl+ + H2 reactions are found to be constant in the range of temperatures studied, except for the DCl+ + D2 reaction, where a weak negative temperature dependence is observed, and reactions with D2 are found to be significantly slower than the Langevin rate. No isotopic exchange reactions are observed to occur for the H2Cl+ ion. The analysis of the products of the HCl+ + H2 isotopic system clearly indicates that the reaction proceeds via simple hydrogen atom abstraction.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we calibrate the luminosity relation of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) framework for reconstructing the Hubble parameter \unboldmath{$H(z)$} from the latest observational Hubble data (OHD) obtained with the cosmic chronometers method in a cosmology-independent way. We consider the physical relationships between the data to introduce the covariance matrix and KL divergence of the data to construct the loss function and calibrate the Amati relation ($E_{\rm p}$--$E_{\rm iso}$) by selecting the optimal ANN model with the A219 sample and the J220 sample at low redshift. Combining the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) with GRBs at high redshift in the Hubble diagram with Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical method, we find that the $\Lambda$CDM model is preferred over the $w$CDM and CPL models with the joint constraints by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) JWST observations have measured the ice composition toward two highly-extinguished field stars in the Chamaeleon I cloud. The observed extinction excess on the long-wavelength side of the H2O ice band at 3 micron has been attributed to a mixture of CH3OH with ammonia hydrates, which suggests that CH3OH ice could have formed in a water-rich environment with little CO depletion. Laboratory experiments and quantum chemical calculations suggest that CH3OH could form via the grain surface reactions CH3+OH and/or C+H2O in water-rich ices. However, no dedicated chemical modelling has been carried out thus far to test their efficiency and dependence on the astrochemical code employed. We model the ice chemistry in the Chamaeleon I cloud using a set of astrochemical codes (MAGICKAL, MONACO, Nautilus, UCLCHEM, and KMC simulations) to test the effects of the different code architectures and of the assumed ice chemistry. Our models show that the JWST ice observations are better reproduced for gas densities >1e5 cm-3 and collapse times >1e5 yr. CH3OH ice forms predominantly (>99%) via CO hydrogenation. The contribution of reactions CH3+OH and C+H2O, is negligible. The CO2 ice may form either via CO+OH or CO+O depending on the code. However, KMC simulations reveal that both mechanisms are efficient despite the low rate constant of the CO+O surface reaction. CH4 is largely underproduced for all codes except for UCLCHEM, for which a higher amount of atomic C is available during the initial translucent cloud phase. Large differences in the ice abundances are found at Tdust<12 K between diffusive and non-diffusive chemistry codes. This is due to the fact that non-diffusive chemistry takes over diffusive chemistry at such low Tdust. This could explain the rather constant ice chemical composition found in Chamaeleon I and other dense cores despite the different visual extinctions probed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the MeerKAT discovery and MeerLICHT contemporaneous optical observations of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) 20230808F, which was found to have a dispersion measure of $\mathrm{DM}=653.2\pm0.4\mathrm{\,pc\,cm^{-3}}$. FRB 20230808F has a scattering timescale $\tau_{s}=3.1\pm0.1\,\mathrm{ms}$ at $1563.6$ MHz, a rotation measure $\mathrm{RM}=169.4\pm0.2\,\mathrm{rad\,m^{-2}}$, and a radio fluence $F_{\mathrm{radio}}=1.72\pm0.01\,\mathrm{Jy\,ms}$. We find no optical counterpart in the time immediately after the FRB, nor in the three months after the FRB during which we continued to monitor the field of the FRB. We set an optical upper flux limit in MeerLICHT's $q$-band of $11.7\,\mathrm{\mu Jy}$ for a 60 s exposure which started $\sim3.4$ s after the burst, which corresponds to an optical fluence, $F_{\mathrm{opt}}$, of $0.039\,\mathrm{Jy\,ms}$ on a timescale of $\sim3.4$ s. We obtain an estimate for the $q-$band luminosity limit of $vL_{v}\sim 1.3\times10^{43}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$. We localise the burst to a close galaxy pair at a redshift of $z_{\mathrm{spec}}=0.3472\pm0.0002$. Our time delay of $\sim3.4$ s between the FRB arrival time and the start of our optical exposure is the shortest ever for an as yet non-repeating FRB, and hence the closest to simultaneous optical follow-up that exists for such an FRB.

          A primordial radius valley as a consequence of planet formation

 - **Abstract**
 The radius distribution of close-in planets has been observed to have a bimodal distribution with a dearth of planets around ~1.5-2.0 $R_\oplus$ commonly referred to as the ''radius valley''. The origin of the valley is normally attributed to mass-loss process such as photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss. Recent work, however, has suggested that the radius valley may instead arise as a consequence of gas accretion by low-mass planets. In this work we therefore aim to investigate the formation of a primordial radius valley from the formation of planet cores through pebble accretion up until the dissipation of the protoplanetary disc and subsequent contraction of accreted atmospheres. The goal of this work is to explore the conditions for forming a primordial radius valley from first principles of planet formation theory, rather than attempting to explain the detailed structure of the observed valley. We use an analytical model with minimal assumptions to estimate the contraction rate of atmospheres and, indeed, find the formation of a primordial radius valley. The planets smaller than the valley did not reach the pebble isolation mass, which is required for the planets to cool down sufficiently to be able to accrete a significant amount of gas. We also estimate the slopes of the radius gap as a function of orbital period for the intrinsic population as well as for planets with orbital periods <100 days. For the intrinsic population, the radius gap follows the pebble isolation mass and increases with increasing orbital period, while for close-in planets the direction of the slope reverses and decreases with increasing orbital period. We find that planets smaller than the radius valley are predominantly rocky while the population of planets larger than the valley consists of a mixture of rocky and water-rich planets.

 - **Abstract**
 The ultraviolet/optical telescope (UVOT) onboard the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory is capable of imaging with 7 lenticular filters and of taking slitless spectra with 2 grisms. Both image and grism data have been widely used to study gamma-ray bursts, supernovae and other ultraviolet/optical transients, and proved UVOT is a powerful instrument in time-domain astronomy. However, the second order contamination, for blue sources, strongly limits the red end of ultraviolet (UV) grism spectra. This, in turn, reduces the valid wavelength range to only about 33% of the total. However, to explore the broadband spectral energy distribution of GRBs at the early stage, a larger valid wavelength range is required. Hence based on the uvotpy package, we propose a method to remove the second order contamination from UV grism spectra (nominal mode) up to about 4000Å, i.e., about 70% of the full wavelength range. The 1-sigma systematic uncertainty of this method is about 11.2%. In addition, if a source is red enough, the red end of the valid range could reach about 5000Å. The source code is available on GitHub.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULX) are extragalactic objects with X-ray luminosities above the Eddington limit for a 10 Msun black hole (BH). ULXs may host super-Eddington accreting neutron stars or stellar mass BH, although the exact proportion of the two populations is not yet known. We investigate the properties of the ULX NGC 4559 X7, which shows flux variability up to a factor of 5 on months-to-years and hours-to-days timescales. A flaring activity was also observed during the source highest flux epochs. Flares are unpredictable, with different durations and all flat-topped in flux. The latter suggests that, at the flare peaks, there is likely a common switch-off mechanism for the accretion onto the compact object. We analysed all the available XMM-Newton and Swift/XRT observations to investigate the spectral and temporal evolution of X7, looking for short and long-term variability. We look for long-term periodicities and for coherent signals through accelerated searches that included orbital corrections. We described the X7 spectra with two thermal components plus a cut-off powerlaw model. We found three well defined spectral states, where the spectral variability is mainly driven by the two harder components. In addition, a pulsed signal at 2.6-2.7s was detected in two XMM-Newton observations. The significance of these coherent signals is relatively weak but they are found in two different observations with the same parameter space for the orbital properties. If confirmed, it would imply a high spin-down of 1e-9 s/s, which could be extreme amongst the known pulsating ULXs. X7 would become a new extragalactic ULX pulsar. We discuss the spectral and temporal results of X7 in the context of super-Eddington accretion onto a stellar-mass compact object, in particular suggesting that the source might likely host a neutron star.

 - **Abstract**
 We calculate the action and the interaction Hamiltonians to all orders in perturbation theory in the model of single field inflation with a transient ultra slow-roll phase. Employing the formalism of EFT of inflation, we obtain a compact non-perturbative expression for the interaction Hamiltonian in terms of the Goldstone field $\pi$ in the decoupling limit. In addition, we also present a non-linear relation between $\pi$ and the curvature perturbations to all orders in perturbation theory. These are powerful results which enable us to calculate the cosmological correlators and loop corrections to any order in perturbation theory. As a non-trivial example, we calculate the $L$-loop corrections on long CMB scale perturbations in the USR models which are used for PBHs formation. We show that the loop corrections scale like $(\Delta N {\cal P}_e L) ^L$ in which ${\cal P}_e$ is the peak of the power spectrum and $\Delta N$ is the duration of the USR phase. This indicates that the loop corrections grow quickly out of perturbative control for large values of $L$. In the conventional USR setup for PBHs formation with $\Delta N \simeq 2.5$, this happens at $L=4$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the detection of a peculiar high-frequency noise component in the 20 second cadence SAP (Simple Aperture Photometry) light curve of TESS (Transiting Exoplanets Survey Satellite). This effect (labeled as blue noise) may be attributed to the pointing instability (also known as satellite jiiter) of the satellite. We present a common technique used in the mitigation of the jitter, by decorrelating against the subpixel position of the photo-center of the point spread function of the star. We also show that a simple linear or polynomial technique may not yield satisfactory corrections, as the behavior or attitude of the noise properties may change considerably throughout the light curve.
