 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries of apparent large-scale features in the structure of the universe, extending over many hundreds of megaparsecs, have been claimed to contradict the large-scale isotropy and homogeneity foundational to the standard ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model. We explicitly test and refute this conjecture using FLAMINGO-10K, a new and very large cosmological simulation of the growth of structure in a $\Lambda$CDM context. Applying the same methods used in the observations, we show that patterns like the "Giant Arc", supposedly in tension with the standard model, are, in fact, common and expected in a $\Lambda$CDM universe. We also show that their reported significant overdensities are an algorithmic artefact and unlikely to reflect any underlying structure.

 - **Abstract**
 The absence of direct high redshift observations poses a significant challenge in understanding the properties of first stars. Nonetheless, the cumulative effect of entire stellar populations can be studied with current data. In this work we use a combination of high redshift observables in order to infer the formation and emission properties of the first stellar populations: high redshift UVLFs, the optical depth of CMB photons to reionization, hydrogen absorption lines in quasar spectra, and measurements of the soft cosmic X-ray background. We study two minimal models of stellar population: i) a single, Pop-II, stellar population which dominates throughout Cosmic Dawn, ii) two distinct stellar populations, Pop-II and Pop-III, dominating at different times with the transition between them taken as a free parameter. We set strong constraints on the properties of Pop-II stars, and upper limits on the formation and multi-wavelength emission of Pop-III stars. After applying the constraints above, we present the viable envelopes of the 21-cm global signal with and without Pop-III stars. We identify a region in the parameter space of the two population model which predicts a global 21-cm signal distinctive from that of the single population one. A measurement of such a signal would be a strong indication for the presence of Pop-III stars at early times.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrometry from Gaia has enabled discovery of three dormant black holes (BHs) in au-scale binaries. Numerous models have been proposed to explain their formation, including several that have forecasted Gaia detections. However, previous works have used simplified detectability metrics that do not capture key elements of the Gaia astrometric orbit selection function. We apply a realistic forward-model of Gaia astrometric orbit catalogs to BH binary populations generated through (a) isolated binary evolution (IBE) and (b) dynamical formation in star clusters. For both formation channels, we analyze binary populations in a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy with a realistic metallicity-dependent star formation history and 3D dust map. We generate epoch astrometry for each binary from the Gaia scanning law and fit it with the cascade of astrometric models used in Gaia DR3. The IBE model of Chawla et al. (2022) predicts that no BH binaries should have been detected in DR3 and thus significantly underpredicts the formation rate of Gaia BHs. In contrast, the dynamical model of Di Carlo et al. (2024) overpredicts the number of BHs receiving DR3 orbital solutions by a factor of $\sim$8. The two models predict very different orbital period distributions, with the IBE model predicting only binaries that avoided common envelope evolution and have $P_{\text{orb}} \gtrsim 2,000$ d to be detectable, and the dynamical formation model predicting a period distribution that is roughly log-uniform. Adopting the dynamical channel as a fiducial model and rescaling by a factor of 1/8 to match DR3, we predict that $\sim$30 BH binaries will be detected in Gaia DR4, representing $\sim0.1\%$ of Milky Way BHs with luminous companions in au-scale orbits.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar parameters for large samples of stars play a crucial role in constraining the nature of stars and stellar populations in the Galaxy. An increasing number of medium-band photometric surveys are presently used in estimating stellar parameters. In this study, we present a machine-learning approach to derive estimates of stellar parameters, including [Fe/H], logg, and Teff, based on a combination of medium-band and broad-band photometric observations. Our analysis employs data primarily sourced from the SAGE Survey , which aims to observe much of the Northern Hemisphere. We combine the $uv$-band data from SAGES DR1 with photometric and astrometric data from Gaia EDR3, and apply the random forest method to estimate stellar parameters for approximately 21 million stars. We are able to obtain precisions of 0.09 dex for [Fe/H], 0.12 dex for logg, and 70 K for Teff. Furthermore, by incorporating 2MASS and WISE infrared photometric and GALEX ultraviolet data, we are able to achieve even higher precision estimates for over 2.2 million stars. These results are applicable to both giant and dwarf stars. Building upon this mapping, we construct a foundational dataset for research on metal-poor stars, the structure of the Milky Way, and beyond. With the forthcoming release of additional bands from SAGE Survey such DDO51 and H-alpha, this versatile machine learning approach is poised to play an important role in upcoming surveys featuring expanded filter sets

 - **Abstract**
 When cosmic strings are formed during inflation, they regrow to reach a scaling regime, leaving distinct imprints on the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Such signatures, associated with specific primordial features, can be detected by upcoming gravitational wave observatories, such as the LISA and Einstein Telescope (ET). Our analysis explores scenarios in which cosmic strings form either before or during inflation. We examine how the number of e-folds experienced by cosmic strings during inflation correlates with the predictions of inflationary models observable in cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements. This correlation provides a testable link between inflationary physics and the associated gravitational wave signals in a complementary manner. Focusing on $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation, with the Polynomial $\alpha$-attractor serving as an illustrative example, we find constraints, for instance, on the spectral index $n_s$ to $0.962 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.972$ for polynomial exponent $n=1$, $0.956 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.968$ for $n=2$, $0.954 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.965$ for $n=3$, and $0.963 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.964$ for $n=4$, which along with the GW signals from LISA, are capable of detecting local cosmic strings that have experienced $\sim 34 - 47$ e-folds of inflation consistent with current Planck data and are also testable in upcoming CMB experiments such as LiteBIRD and CMB-S4.

          Scaling relations and tidal disruption in spin $s$ ultralight dark matter models

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the impact of spin 0, spin 1 and spin 2 Ultra-Light Dark Matter (ULDM) on small scales by numerically solving the Schrödinger-Poisson system using the time-split method. We perform simulations of ULDM for each spin, starting with different numbers of identical initial solitons and analyse the properties of the resulting halos after they merge and relax in a steady-state. Our findings reveal that higher spin values lead to broader, less dense final halo with more prominent Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) tails, a characteristic that persists regardless of the number of initial solitons involved. We identify scaling relations that describe the density profile, core and NFW tail of spin $s$ ULDM halos as a function of the number of initial solitons $N_{sol}$. These relations allow us to construct equivalent halos based on average density or total mass, for arbitrarily large $N_{sol}$, without having to simulate those systems. We simulate the orbit of a ULDM satellite in a constructed halo treated as an external potential, and find that for host halos having the same average density, the orbital decay time of the satellite is as predicted for uniform sphere host halo regardless of the spin. However, satellites orbiting haloes having the same mass for each spin, result in faster disruption in the case of spin 0, while satellites orbiting haloes having the same core size result in faster disruption in the case of spin 2.

          Observable Primordial Gravitational Waves from Non-minimally Coupled $R^2$ Palatini Modified Gravity

 - **Abstract**
 We probe the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves (GWs) produced during the eras of hyperkination, kination, and reheating in a non-minimally coupled, $\mathcal{L} \propto (1+ \xi \chi /M_{\text{Pl}})^t (R+\alpha R^2)$, modified gravity using the Palatini formulation. We consider a runaway potential, which gives an era of kinetic domination after the end of inflation. The coupling order $t$ is varied to examine a large class of theories up to $\chi^2 R^2$. For models with $t>0$, reheating is not achieved naturally; hence, we supplement such theories with a reheating mechanism based on the interaction of inflaton and radiation produced at the end of inflation due to cosmological expansion. We demonstrate that the energy density of the GWs is enhanced as a function of the coupling during kination for all considered theories, and a short-lived phase of hyperkination truncates the boost and avoids the over-production of GWs. Hyperkination, and thus the $R^2$ term, should be deemed necessary in all theories with a runaway potential as it prevents the GW enhancement during kination from destabilizing the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The spectrum remains flat for the period of hyperkination and reheating. We examine the available parameter space for which the theories remain valid and place bounds on the Hubble parameter ($H$) and radiation energy density ($\Omega_r^{\text{end}}$) at the end of inflation. We find that as we decrease the order of the coupling, the spectra shift towards a more observable regime of future GW experiments. The observation of the plateau during reheating will constrain the $H$ and $\Omega_r^{\text{end}}$ values, while the spectral shape of the boost obtained during kination will confirm the nature of the theory. The bounds from hyperkination lie in the kHz-GHz frequency range whose detection can be positively anticipated via resonant cavities.

 - **Abstract**
 Meridian circles played a fundamental role in astronomy since their invention in 1704. Then, at the end of the XX century, this function had been taken over by space astrometry, when the Hipparcos mission demonstrated the advantages of space astrometry by achieving the milliarcsecond level of accuracy. This historical sketch describes the development of the last meridian circles at Pulkovo Observatory (St. Petersburg) in the last quarter of the XX century.

 - **Abstract**
 We probe the effect of the ISM on debris disc occurrence rates and on the morphologies of the discs. We used results from the Herschel Space Observatory DUNES and DEBRIS surveys of 295 nearby FGK dwarf stars imaged at 100 $\mu$m and 160 $\mu$m. Most of the 48 debris discs in this sample have small optical depths, making them more likely to be affected by the ISM compared to optically thick discs. Since the stars in our sample are located within the Local Interstellar Cloud, we can infer that their debris discs encounter similar conditions. This allows us to use the stellar space velocity as a single indicator of the forces that can act on the debris disc dust grains when they interact with the ISM. The observed debris disc occurrence rates seem to depend on the stellar space velocities, as expected under the hypothesis that stars with higher space velocities have a higher probability of losing their circumstellar dust. The percentage of sources with debris discs in our sample reaches a maximum of $\approx$25% for stars with low space velocity component values, $|U_{\mathrm{rel}}|$, relative to the local ISM, and decreases for larger $|U_{\mathrm{rel}}|$ values down to the 10% level. A decrease in the average disc fractional luminosity as a function of $|U_{\mathrm{rel}}|$ is also observed. These dependences do not disappear after accounting for the reported higher dispersion of $U$ values with age. In extended discs, the impact of the ISM could also explain the links observed between the stellar space velocities and the debris disc projected ellipticities, position angles, and radii. Although these indications may not be fully conclusive on their own, they collectively reinforce the hypothesis that the ISM influences the occurrence rates and morphologies of debris discs.

          Measuring the Sun's Core with Neutrino Measurements: A Solar Orbiter Concept

 - **Abstract**
 Traditional neutrino detectors are built deep underground to reduce backgrounds. The neutrino solar orbiting laboratory ($\nu$SOL) collaboration has been developing a concept to improve neutrino measurement not with a larger detector underground, but instead we use the nuclear excitation from the neutrino interaction to produce a multi-pulse signal. Cerium-doped gadolinium aluminum gallium garnet (GAGG) is a new scintillator which has 23\% gallium by mass. When a neutrino interacts with the GAGG, about 10\% of the time it will be in an excited nuclear state rather than in the base energy level. A segmented detector looking for the pulses separated by distance and time has the potential to greatly limit background noise from solar wind, cosmic rays, and galactic gamma rays. A polar LEO CubeSat mission is currently in development to measure the GCR backgrounds outside the Van Allen Belts. In this summary of my presentation I will quickly lay the groundwork of the interaction of interest and what a solar orbiter's detector could look like. I will then explore what measurements a near-solar orbiter could make. With these measurements in mind, I will discuss the feasibility of a direct observation of the core's shape, and I will discuss how a solar orbiter's measurements could improve a Standard Solar Model search and compare that measurement with the current global neutrino measurements. I will conclude with a discussion of what these observables could tell us about the solar interior.

          Iron-corrected Single-epoch Black Hole Masses of DESI Quasars at low redshift

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study on the possible overestimation of single-epoch supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses in previous works, based on more than 55,000 type 1 quasars at $0.25 < z < 0.8$ from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We confirm that iron emission strength serves as a good tracer of the Eddington ratio, and estimate SMBH masses using an iron-corrected $R$-$L$ relation for H$\beta$, where $R$ is the broad line region size and $L$ is the continuum luminosity. Compared to our measurements, previous canonical measurements without the iron correction are overestimated by a factor of 1.5 on average. The overestimation can be up to a factor of 5 for super-Eddington quasars. The fraction of super-Eddington quasars in our sample is about 5%, significantly higher than 0.4% derived from the canonical measurements. Using a sample featuring both H$\beta$ and MgII emission lines, we calibrate MgII-based SMBH masses using iron-corrected, H$\beta$-based SMBH masses and establish an iron-corrected $R$-$L$ relation for MgII. The new relation adds an extra term of $-0.34R_{\mathrm{Fe}}$ to the $R$-$L$ relation, where $R_{\mathrm{Fe}}$ denotes the relative iron strength. We use this formula to build a catalog of about 0.5 million DESI quasars at $0.6<z<1.6$. If these iron-corrected $R$-$L$ relations for H$\beta$ and MgII are valid at high redshift, current mass measurements of luminous quasars at $z\ge6$ would have been overestimated by a factor of 2.3 on average, alleviating the tension between SMBH mass and growth history in the early universe.

          Electron-induced CO2 and hydrocarbon sputtering of functionalized hydrocarbons in icy planetary analogs

 - **Abstract**
 CO2 has been detected in both the tenuous exosphere and surface chaos regions of Europa, but it is still unclear whether this CO2 is generated in situ by radiolysis or whether it is directly delivered by the ocean. In this work, we study the radiolysis pathway, and explore the possibility that organics upwelled from the subsurface oceans could be contributing to this signature on the surface and in the exosphere. Specifically, we report here on the evolution of carbon-containing byproducts generated by electron-induced sputtering of organics with different functional groups -- hexanoic acid, hexanol, and hexane -- in water ice. We found that, upon electron irradiation in vacuum, the acid-functionalized molecules generated a factor of over 10x more CO2 than either the non-functionalized or alcohol-functionalized molecules, but that all three species produced CO2 to some extent. The amount of CO2 produced was found to depend upon temperature. CO2 was the dominant product for ices at 100 K and 120 K, and production of CO2 was 3x higher at 100 and 120 K than at 80 K. Sputtering of long chain molecules such as pentane was a factor of 100x higher in the hexanoic acid-containing ice than in the hexane/hexanol ice, suggesting that organics with carboxylic acid (COOH) functional groups may be also more likely to produce volatile species that can be ejected into the exosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar radio observation is an important way to study the Sun. Solar radio bursts contain important information about solar activity. Therefore, real-time automatic detection and classification of solar radio bursts are of great value for subsequent solar physics research and space weather warnings. Traditional image classification methods based on deep learning often require consid-erable training data. To address insufficient solar radio spectrum images, transfer learning is generally used. However, the large difference between natural images and solar spectrum images has a large impact on the transfer learning effect. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning method for solar radio spectrum classification. Our method uses self-supervised training with a self-masking approach in natural language processing. Self-supervised learning is more conducive to learning the essential information about images compared with supervised methods, and it is more suitable for transfer learning. First, the method pre-trains using a large amount of other existing data. Then, the trained model is fine-tuned on the solar radio spectrum dataset. Experiments show that the method achieves a classification accuracy similar to that of convolutional neural networks and Transformer networks with supervised training.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar radio observation is a method used to study the Sun. It is very important for space weather early warning and solar physics research to automatically classify solar radio spectrums in real time and judge whether there is a solar radio burst. As the number of solar radio burst spectrums is small and uneven, this paper proposes a classification method for solar radio spectrums based on the Swin transformer. First, the method transfers the parameters of the pretrained model to the Swin transformer model. Then, the hidden layer weights of the Swin transformer are frozen, and the fully connected layer of the Swin transformer is trained on the target dataset. Finally, pa-rameter tuning is performed. The experimental results show that the method can achieve a true positive rate of 100%, which is more accurate than previous methods. Moreover, the number of our model parameters is only 20 million, which is 80% lower than that of the traditional VGG16 con-volutional neural network with more than 130 million parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the GeV $\gamma$-ray emission around the composite supernova remnant (SNR) CTB 87 with more than 16 yrs PASS 8 data recorded by the Fermi Large Area Telescope. Two separate point sources with the different GeV spectra are identified in this region: one has a soft $\gamma$-ray spectrum, likely due to interactions between the SNR shock and molecular clouds (MCs); and another source with a hard GeV $\gamma$-ray spectrum aligns with the TeV spectrum of VER J2016+371, suggesting it as the GeV counterpart. Considering the observations of CTB 87 in the radio and X-ray bands, VER J2016+371 is proposed to originate from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with PSR J2016+3711. A leptonic model with a broken power-law electron distribution could explain the multi-wavelength data of VER J2016+371, with fitted parameters matching typical $\gamma$-ray PWNe. Deeper searching for the SNR shock of CTB 87 in other bands and the future TeV observations by LHAASO and CTA are crucial to reveal the nature of CTB 87.

 - **Abstract**
 Studies on star clusters with the same age and initial chemical composition have gained momentum in recent years with the use of \textit{Gaia}. In addition, the discovery of new clusters with Gaia has increased the number of open clusters to be examined. Many of these discovered sources are intermediate-age open clusters and have not been analyzed in detail yet. In this study, we focused on newly cataloged open cluster UPK~220. The fundamental parameters (distance, age, metallicity and reddening) of UPK~220 were determined by analysing the variable stars within the cluster, while simultaneously constraining the parameters of the variable stars using these cluster parameters. To achieve this, we combined GaiaDR3 and TESS photometric observations. Using GaiaDR3, we derive fundamental parameters of UPK~220 through membership analyses, and with TESS, we discovered eight member variable stars. We also extracted the atmospheric parameters ($logg$, $[Fe/H]$ and $T_{\rm eff}$) for the variable stars using SED, GSP-Phot and GSP-Spec, and MESA models.

 - **Abstract**
 The central molecular zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy exhibits widespread emission from SiO and various complex organic molecules (COMs), yet the exact origin of such emission is uncertain. Here we report the discovery of a unique class of long ($>$0.5 pc) and narrow ($<$0.03 pc) filaments in the emission of SiO 5$-$4 and eight additional molecular lines, including several COMs, in our ALMA 1.3 mm spectral line observations toward two massive molecular clouds in the CMZ, which we name as slim filaments. However, these filaments are not detected in the 1.3 mm continuum at the 5$\sigma$ level. Their line-of-sight velocities are coherent and inconsistent with being outflows. The column densities and relative abundances of the detected molecules are statistically similar to those in protostellar outflows but different from those in dense cores within the same clouds. Turbulent pressure in these filaments dominates over self gravity and leads to hydrostatic inequilibrium, indicating that they are a different class of objects than the dense gas filaments in dynamical equilibrium ubiquitously found in nearby molecular clouds. We argue that these newly detected slim filaments are associated with parsec-scale shocks, likely arising from dynamic interactions between shock waves and molecular clouds. The dissipation of the slim filaments may replenish SiO and COMs in the interstellar medium and lead to their widespread emission in the CMZ.

          Gaps in stellar streams as a result of globular cluster fly-bys

 - **Abstract**
 Thin stellar streams, such as those resulting from the tidal disruption of globular clusters, have long been known and used as probes of the gravitational potential of our Galaxy, both its visible and dark contents. In particular, the presence of under-density regions, or gaps, along these streams is commonly interpreted as being due to the close passage of dark matter sub-halos. In this work, we investigate the perturbations induced on streams by the passage of dense stellar systems, such as globular clusters themselves, to test the possibility that they may cause the formation of gaps as well. In particular, we focus on the study of the stream of Palomar 5, a well-known globular cluster in the Galactic halo, which has particularly long tidal tails. For this purpose, we used a particle-test code to simulate Palomar 5's tidal tails when subjected to the Galaxy's gravitational field plus its whole system of globular clusters. Our study shows that the tails of Palomar 5 can be strongly perturbed by the close passage of other clusters, in particular of NGC 2808, NGC 7078, NGC 104, and that these perturbations induce the formation of gaps in the tails. These results show that globular clusters are capable of inducing gaps in streams--as other baryonic components such as giant molecular clouds and the galactic bar have been shown to do in other works. Therefore, when searching to construct the distribution function of dark matter sub halos within the Milky Way, the gap contribution from globular clusters must be included.

 We present a detailed systematic pulse search for three Intermittent-Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsars (Intermittent-AMXPs), HETE J1900.1-2455, SAX J1748.9-2021 & Aql X-1, via Z$_1^2$ and maximum likelihood (ML) techniques by using 16 years data of Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer/Proportional Counter Array (RXTE/PCA) in the energy range of 3.0 - 13.0 keV. We first performed a pulse scan using the Z$_1^2$ technique in millisecond sensitivities for every 25 s time interval with 1 s shifts to cover all data set around the detected frequencies given in the literature. We tracked the Z$_1^2$ power over time and flagged the time intervals exceeding defined threshold levels for each source as \textit{pulse candidates}. The detected pulse list throughout our scan has new discoveries while covering the pulsed regions presented in the literature. For a deeper search, using the pulses obtained from the Z$_1^2$ method as a probability density function as an input parameter, we re-scanned the time intervals centered on the detected pulse via ML. The detected pulse-on duration via ML is slightly longer than the one via Z$_1^2$ method. This phenomenon allows us to argue for the existence of the smooth transition between pulse-on and pulse-off stages. For SAX J1748.9-2021, we also obtained orbital period by using the systematic pulse arrival phase patterns throughput of ML to be 8.76 hours.

 - **Abstract**
 A superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), functioning as a nonlinear response device, typically requires the incorporation of a flux-locked loop (FLL) circuit to facilitate linear amplification of the current signal transmitted through a superconducting transition-edge sensor (TES) across a large dynamic range. This work presents a reasonable model of the SQUID-FLL readout system, based on a digital proportional-integral-differential (PID) flux negative feedback algorithm. This work investigates the effect of $V$-$\phi$ shape on the performance of digital FLL circuits. Such as the impact factors of bandwidth, design limits of slew rate of the system and the influence of the shapes of SQUID $V$-$\phi$ curve. Furthermore, the dynamic response of the system to X-ray pulse signals with rise time ranging from $4.4{\sim}281$ $\mathrm{{\mu}s}$ and amplitudes ranging from $6{\sim}8$ $\mathrm{\phi_0}$ was simulated. All the simulation results were found to be consistent with the existing mature theories, thereby validating the accuracy of the model. The results also provide a reliable modelling reference for the design of digital PID flux negative feedback and multiplexing SQUID readout electronic systems.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray inter-band time lags are observed during the outbursts of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs). Timing analysis of fast variability in low Fourier frequency bands shows that high-energy photons lag behind low-energy photons, a phenomenon referred to as hard lag. Conversely, in high Fourier frequency bands, low-energy photons lag behind high-energy photons, known as soft lag. This frequency-dependent lag spectrum suggests that the lags arise from different physical processes. Notably, a trend has been observed wherein the lags shift towards shorter timescales during the rising hard state, indicating an evolution in the inner accretion flow. In this study, we simulate these inter-band lags by conducting Monte Carlo simulations of the rapid variability within the geometry of a jet base corona. We consider both inward propagating accretion rate fluctuations and reverberation (light crossing) delays in our simulations. We successfully reproduce both low-frequency hard lags and high-frequency soft lags in a self-consistent manner. We replicate the observed evolution of the frequency-dependent lag spectra by varying the geometrical scale of the corona and the viscous frequency of the disc. Finally, we discuss the potential of a spherical corona and emphasize that polarization observations from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission (eXTP) will be crucial for distinguishing the corona's geometry in future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the flux intensities spanning from radio waves to X-rays across 39 light curves of Quasar 3C 273, utilizing publicly available data collected by the Integral Science Data Centre (ISDC) database. Our results suggest that Quasar 3C 273 exhibits nonextensive behavior. Furthermore, we calculate the $q$ entropic indices for these light curves using the $q$-Gaussian distribution with a predominant observation of cases where $q>1$. Based on this index, we estimate the non-extensive entropy ($S_{q}$) and explore its correlation with the energy (in eV). In this context, we identify two jump-like increases in entropy, particularly evident in the infrared (IR) and X-ray wavebands. The peak in the far-IR band, around 0.34 eV, results from synchrotron flares evolving from higher to lower energies and thermal radiation emitted by hot dust near the sublimation radius. However, the second entropic peak in the hard X-ray range lacks statistical robustness due to limited data or large measurement uncertainties.

          From Planetesimals to Dwarf Planets by Pebble Accretion

 - **Abstract**
 The size distribution of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) in the Kuiper Belt provides crucial insights into the formation and evolution of the outer Solar System. Recent observational surveys, including OSSOS++, have revealed that dynamically cold and hot TNO populations exhibit similar size distributions for dimmer objects ($H_r > 5$), which are consistent with planetesimal formation by streaming instability (SI). However, the hot population contains a significantly larger number of massive bodies, including several dwarf planets. In this study, we investigate the role of pebble accretion in shaping the size distribution of hot TNOs, after their formation in the primordial disk (PB) between 20 and 30 au and before these bodies were dynamically implanted into their current orbits by a migrating Neptune. We find that pebble accretion grows the most massive bodies only, consistent with the flattening of the distribution brightwards of $H_r=5$. All results point to a correlation (degeneracy) between the pebble aerodynamic size and the intensity of the gas motions. Nevertheless, accretion from an inward-drifting stream of pebbles is unlikely, as it puts extreme demands on the mass budget of pebbles. In particular, the masses of the cold classicals are too low to trigger pebble accretion. Accretion in an environment where pebbles are entrained, as believed to be the case in ALMA rings, is preferable. Combining the constraints obtained from this study with ALMA imagery morphology fitting reveals a typical pebble aerodynamic size of $\tau_s \sim 10^{-2}$, a turbulent diffusivity parameter $\alpha_D\sim10^{-3}$, and a total accreted pebble mass of ${\sim}10\,m_\oplus$ in the primordial belt. Those TNOs formed through significant pebble accretion with masses exceeding ${\sim}10^{-4}\,m_\oplus$ are likely to satisfy the International Astronomical Union's "round shape" criterion for dwarf planets.

 - **Abstract**
 The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Observatory is gearing up the formal construction of its two radio interferometers in Australia and South Africa after the end of design and pre-construction phases. Agile methodologies, the Cloud native Computing technologies and the DevOps software ideas are influencing the design of compute infrastructures that will be key to reduce the operational costs of SKA while improving the control and monitoring of the SKA antennas and ancillary systems, Correlators, HPC facilities or related data centre tiered systems. These tools will likely include advanced power metering technologies and efficient distribution automation and Network Operation Centres (NOC). SKA will become the world's largest radio telescope and is expected to achieve its first science by 2026. To cope with this dimension and complexity, a key part of this distributed Observatory is the overall software control and monitoring system embodied in the Observatory Management and Control (OMC) and the Services Teams that requires specialized Agile Teams to assist in software and cyber infrastructure building using an Agile development environment that includes test automation, Continuous Integration, and Continuous Deployment. To manage such a large and distributed machine, the Agile approach was adopted for the core software package of the SKA Telescope aimed at scheduling observations, controlling their execution, monitoring the telescope status and ensuring scalability and reliability. Here, we report on the ENGAGE SKA ciberinfrastructure prototyping support to the SKA Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

 - **Abstract**
 Symbiotic stars serve as exceptional laboratories for investigating mass transfer processes in binary systems. However, the dominant mechanism of mass transfer from the red giant donor to the compact accretor - typically a white dwarf or, in rare cases, a neutron star - remains unclear. It is uncertain whether it is driven primarily by the stellar wind, Roche-lobe overflow, or a combination of the two. While radii inferred from rotational velocities or spectral types suggest smaller Roche-lobe filling factors, the presence of ellipsoidal variability, presumably caused by tidally deformed giants in many symbiotic systems, indicates the opposite. Interferometric observations of symbiotic giants, combined with distance measurements provided by the Gaia mission, offer a promising avenue to resolve this discrepancy. In this first paper of the series, we (re)analyze VLTI/PIONIER observations of six symbiotic stars: AG Peg, FG Ser, ER Del, V1261 Ori, RW Hya, and V399 Pav. With the exception of the uncertain case of V399 Pav, we find that the giants in these systems remain well within their canonical Roche lobes, even in V1261 Ori and RW Hya, where ellipsoidal variability is observed. All six stars appear to be rather luminous and likely located on the asymptotic giant branch, although the possibility of some of them being at the tip of the first red giant branch cannot be ruled out.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar prominences are very spectacular structures embedded in the tenuous and hot solar corona. The counterstreaming flows, a common feature in solar quiescent prominences, have been discovered for more than twenty years. However, the mechanism driving the counterstreaming flows is still elusive. To unveil the nature of this phenomenon, we analyzed the data of a quiescent prominence observed by the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST), the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and the Solar Dynamical Observatory (SDO). It is found that there is a distinct longitudinal oscillation of prominence plasma along the higher part of the prominence spine in H$\alpha$ observations. The oscillation period is approximately 83 minutes and the amplitude is about 32 Mm. The counterstreaming flows are dominant in the middle part of the prominence spine. The velocities of the counterstreaming flows range from about 4 km s$^{-1}$ to 11 km s$^{-1}$. Moreover, the intermittent mass flows with the upward plumes from the top of the bubbles and tornado-like barbs are observed to be injected into the lower part of the prominence spine from the lower atmosphere. The velocities of these injected mass flows range from about 3 km s$^{-1}$ to 30 km s$^{-1}$. Some injected mass flows exhibit redshifted Doppler signals, while others exhibit blueshifted signals. Based on these high resolution observations, it is found that different parts of the prominence spine exhibit the different dynamic characteristics. These results further advance the understanding of the ubiquitous counterstreaming flows in solar quiescent prominences.

 - **Abstract**
 The gamma-ray emission from Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), a sub-class of blazars, is believed to be generated through interactions of high-energy leptons and/or hadrons in the jet with the ambient photon fields, including those from the accretion disk, the broad line region (BLR), and the dusty torus. However, these same photon fields can also attenuate gamma-rays through internal photon-photon (gamma-gamma) absorption, imprinting characteristic spectral features. Investigating the internal absorption is crucial for unraveling the complex structure of FSRQs and constraining the poorly known location of the gamma-ray emission region. In this study, we select a sample of gamma-ray detected FSRQs with high redshift (z >= 3), to search for absorption features appearing at lower photon energies due to a substantial redshift. We extract the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray spectra of these sources and perform physical modeling using a detailed gamma-gamma opacity model, assuming that the BLR photon field dominates the absorption and focusing on the energy range ~25 GeV/(1+z), where the absorption feature due to Ly{\alpha} photons is expected. Our analysis reveals a hint of internal absorption for one source (the lowest redshift object in our sample, z~3) and provides constraints on the location of its gamma-ray emitting region along the jet. For the remaining, higher-redshift sources, the limited photon statistics prevent a reliable detection of internal opacity features.

 - **Abstract**
 Diffusion models have been used in cosmological applications as a generative model for fast simulations and to reconstruct underlying cosmological fields or astrophysical images from noisy data. These two tasks are often treated as separate: diffusion models trained for one purpose do not generalize to perform the other task. In this paper, we develop a single diffusion model that can be used for both tasks. By using the Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) approach, we use a diffusion model trained to simulate weak lensing maps for the inverse problem of reconstructing mass maps from noisy weak lensing data. We find that the standard DPS method leads to biased inference but we correct this bias by down weighting the likelihood term at early sampling time steps of the diffusion. Our method give us a way to reconstruct accurate high-resolution (sub-arcminute) mass maps that have the correct power spectrum and a range of non-Gaussian summary statistics. We discuss several applications enabled by the computational efficiency and accuracy of our model. These include generation of simulation quality mass maps, aiding covariance estimation for higher order statistics, and for finding filaments, voids and clusters from noisy lensing shear data.

 - **Abstract**
 For a new parameterization of the modified effective chiral model, developed primarily to regulate the density content of the symmetry energy and its higher order terms, equations of state (EoSs) for hyperon-rich matter ($H$) and delta baryon matter ($\Delta$) were obtained. The models were used to investigate the emission of gravitational waves (GWs) through $f$-mode oscillations in the corresponding neutron stars. We obtained the stellar structure, $f$-mode frequency and tidal deformability $\Lambda$ for our models. We report that the $\Delta$ EoS is stiffer compared to the $H$ EoS. We also analyzed the velocity of sound in these media. The corresponding mass--radius relationships were obtained and compared with various observations. We studied the dependence of $f$-mode frequencies on the stellar mass, redshift and tidal deformability. We employed the well known Cowling approximation to obtain the $f$-mode frequencies for $l=2,\,3$ and $4$ modes of oscillation. We found that the $f$-mode frequencies of the $H$ and $\Delta$ EoSs were almost the same in the lower mass region, while we observed a substantial difference between them in the high-mass region. We also obtained an empirical relation for the EoSs considered. The various attributes obtained for our models showed close agreement with various observational constraints from pulsars and GW events.

 - **Abstract**
 Measurements of the binary black hole spin distribution from the growing catalog of gravitational-wave observations can help elucidate the astrophysical processes shaping the formation and evolution of these systems. Spin-orbit resonances are one process of interest, in which the component spin vectors and the orbital angular momentum align into a common plane and jointly precess about the total angular momentum of the system. These resonances, which occur preferentially in systems formed via isolated binary evolution with strong tidal effects, lead to excesses in the distribution of the azimuthal angle between the projections of the component spin vectors onto the orbital plane at $\phi_{12}=0,\pm\pi$. Previous analyses have demonstrated that this parameter is particularly difficult to constrain for individual binaries. In this work, we conduct the first hierarchical analysis modeling the population-level distribution of $\phi_{12}$ simultaneously with the other mass and spin parameters for simulated binary black hole populations to determine whether spin-orbit resonances can be reliably constrained. While we are unlikely to find definitive evidence for spin-orbit resonances with a population of the size expected by the end of the ongoing LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA fourth observing run, we correctly recover the various $\phi_{12}$ distributions we simulate within uncertainties. We find that we can place meaningful constraints on the relative excesses at $\phi_{12}=0,\pm\pi$, which encodes information about mass transfer in the formation of the binary. We can also distinguish between fully isotropic spin angle distributions and those with features in the spin azimuth and tilt distributions. Thus, we show that population-level measurements of the $\phi_{12}$ distribution offer a reliable, novel way to probe binary formation channels, dynamics, and mass transfer with gravitational-wave observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The physical conditions of the earliest environment of high-mass star formation are currently poorly understood. To that end, we present observations of the carbon chain molecules HC$_5$N , CCS, and HC$_7$N in the 22-25 GHz band towards 12 high-mass 70 micron-dark clumps (SMDC) with the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We detect HC$_5$N and CCS towards 11 of these SMDC sources. We calculate column densities and abundances relative to H$_2$ for HC$_5$N and CCS. We do not find any clear HC$_7$N detections in the 11 sources individually, but by stacking the HC$_7$N spectra, we do detect HC$_7$N on average in these sources. We also calculate the ratio of the column densities of HC$_5$N to HC$_7$N using the stacked spectra of both species. We compare our measured abundances of HC$_5$N and our measured ratio of HC$_5$N to HC$_7$N to the UMIST dark cloud chemistry models to constrain an age for the gas assuming a fixed volume density and temperature. The chemical models favor a chemical evolutionary age less than 1 Myr at densities of n(H2) = 2 x 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$. The consistent carbon-chain detections and young model-derived ages support the conclusion that these 11 70 micron-dark clumps lack high mass protostars because they are young and not because they are inefficient and incapable of high mass star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We compare multiple foreground-cleaning pipelines for estimating the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, using simulated maps of the planned CMB-S4 experiment within the context of the South Pole Deep Patch. To evaluate robustness, we analyze bias and uncertainty on $r$ across various foreground suites using map-based simulations. The foreground-cleaning methods include: a parametric maximum likelihood approach applied to auto- and cross-power spectra between frequency maps; a map-based parametric maximum-likelihood method; and a harmonic-space internal linear combination using frequency maps. We summarize the conceptual basis of each method to highlight their similarities and differences. To better probe the impact of foreground residuals, we implement an iterative internal delensing step, leveraging a map-based pipeline to generate a lensing $B$-mode template from the Large Aperture Telescope frequency maps. Our results show that the performance of the three approaches is comparable for simple and intermediate-complexity foregrounds, with $\sigma(r)$ ranging from 3 to 5 $\times 10^{-4}$. However, biases at the $1-2\sigma$ level appear when analyzing more complex forms of foreground emission. By extending the baseline pipelines to marginalize over foreground residuals, we demonstrate that contamination can be reduced to within statistical uncertainties, albeit with a pipeline-dependent impact on $\sigma(r)$, which translates to a detection significance between 2 and 4$\sigma$ for an input value of $r = 0.003$. These findings suggest varying levels of maturity among the tested pipelines, with the auto- and cross-spectra-based approach demonstrating the best stability and overall performance. Moreover, given the extremely low noise levels, mutual validation of independent foreground-cleaning pipelines is essential to ensure the robustness of any potential detection.
