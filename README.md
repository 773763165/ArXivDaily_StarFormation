          The effects of different cooling and heating function models on a simulated analog of NGC300

 - **Abstract**
 Gas cooling and heating rates are vital components of hydrodynamic simulations. However, they are computationally expensive to evaluate exactly with chemical networks or photoionization codes. We compare two different approximation schemes for gas cooling and heating in an idealized simulation of an isolated galaxy. One approximation is based on a polynomial interpolation of a table of Cloudy calculations, as is commonly done in galaxy formation simulations. The other approximation scheme uses machine learning for the interpolation instead on an analytic function, with improved accuracy. We compare the temperature-density phase diagrams of gas from each simulation run to assess how much the two simulation runs differ. Gas in the simulation using the machine learning approximation is systematically hotter for low-density gas with $-3 \lesssim \log{(n_b/\mathrm{cm}^{-3})} \lesssim -1$. We find a critical curve in the phase diagram where the two simulations have equal amounts of gas. The phase diagrams differ most strongly at temperatures just above and below this critical curve. We compare CII emission rates for collisions with various particles (integrated over the gas distribution function), and find slight differences between the two simulations. Future comparisons with simulations including radiative transfer will be necessary to compare observable quantities like the total CII luminosity.

          On the Double: Two Luminous Flares from the Nearby Tidal Disruption Event ASASSN-22ci (AT2022dbl) and Connections to Repeating TDE Candidates

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of ASASSN-22ci (AT2022dbl), a nearby tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) at a distance of d$_L \simeq 125$ Mpc. Roughly two years after the initial ASAS-SN discovery, a second flare was detected coincident with ASASSN-22ci. UV/optical photometry and optical spectroscopy indicate that both flares are likely powered by TDEs. The striking similarity in flare properties suggests that these flares result from subsequent disruptions of the same star. Each flare rises on a timescale of $\sim$30 days, has a temperature of $\approx$30,000 K, a peak bolometric luminosity of $L_{UV/Opt} = 10^{43.6 - 43.9} \textrm{ erg} \textrm{ s}^{-1}$, and exhibits a blue optical spectrum with broad H, He, and N lines. No X-ray emission is detected during either flare, but X-ray emission with an unabsorbed luminosity of $L_{X} = 3\times10^{41} \textrm{ erg} \textrm{ s}^{-1}$ and $kT = 0.042$ eV is observed between the flares. Pre-discovery survey observations rule out the existence of earlier flares within the past $\approx$6000 days, indicating that the discovery of ASASSN-22ci likely coincides with the first flare. If the observed flare separation of $720 \pm 4.7$ days is the orbital period, the next flare of ASASSN-22ci should occur near MJD 61075 (2026 February 04). Finally, we find that the existing sample of repeating TDE candidates is consistent with Hills capture of a star initially in a binary with a total mass between $\sim$$1 - 4$ M$_{\odot}$ and a separation of $\sim$$0.01 - 0.1$ AU.

 - **Abstract**
 Building upon [2308.02636], this article investigates the potential constraining power of persistent homology for cosmological parameters and primordial non-Gaussianity amplitudes in a likelihood-free inference pipeline. We evaluate the ability of persistence images (PIs) to infer parameters, compared to the combined Power Spectrum and Bispectrum (PS/BS), and we compare two types of models: neural-based, and tree-based. PIs consistently lead to better predictions compared to the combined PS/BS when the parameters can be constrained (i.e., for $\{\Omega_{\rm m}, \sigma_8, n_{\rm s}, f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}\}$). PIs perform particularly well for $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, showing the promise of persistent homology in constraining primordial non-Gaussianity. Our results show that combining PIs with PS/BS provides only marginal gains, indicating that the PS/BS contains little extra or complementary information to the PIs. Finally, we provide a visualization of the most important topological features for $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ and for $\Omega_{\rm m}$. This reveals that clusters and voids (0-cycles and 2-cycles) are most informative for $\Omega_{\rm m}$, while $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ uses the filaments (1-cycles) in addition to the other two types of topological features.

 - **Abstract**
 The long-duration balloon platform for radio detection of energetic neutrinos, pioneered by ANITA, affords large instantaneous effective areas but has limited livetime. Conversely, tethered balloons, traditionally used for radio detection of non-science objectives (such as electronic surveillance), allow for much longer livetimes, albeit at significantly lower altitudes. In this contribution, a tethered balloon platform for neutrino detection is considered, including estimates of the neutrino sensitivity and a discussion the feasibility of such a platform. Both the Askaryan and tau-neutrino induced Extensive Air Shower channels are explored as target science data for the platform. Tethered balloons locations on ice sheets, land, and in steep valleys or fjords will be considered. Ground-based array calibration and cosmic-ray air shower use cases will also be briefly commented on.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary neutron stars (BNSs) detected in the Milky Way have the total masses distributing narrowly around $\sim2.6-2.7M_\odot$, while the BNS merger GW190425 detected via gravitational wave has a significantly larger mass ($\sim3.4M_\odot$). This difference is not well understood, yet. In this paper, we investigate the BNS spin evolution via an improved binary star evolution model and its effects on the BNS observability, with implementation of various relevant astrophysical processes. We find that the first-born neutron star component in low-mass BNSs can be spun up to millisecond pulsars by the accretion of Roche-lobe overflow from its companion and its radio lifetime can be comparable to the Hubble time. However, most high-mass BNSs have substantially shorter radio lifetime than the low-mass BNSs, and thus smaller probability being detected via radio emission. Adopting the star formation and metal enrichment history of the Milky Way given by observations, we obtain the survived Galactic BNSs with pulsar components from our population synthesis model and find that their distributions on the diagrams of spin period versus spin-period-time-derivative ($P-\dot{P}$) and orbital period versus eccentricity ($P_{\rm orb}-e$) can well match those of the observed Galactic BNSs. The total mass distribution of the observed Galactic BNSs can also be matched by the model. A significant fraction ($\sim19\%-22\%$) of merging BNSs at redshift $z\sim0$ have masses $\gtrsim3M_\odot$, which seems compatible with the GW observations. Future radio observations may detect many more Galactic BNSs, which will put strong constraint on the spin evolution of BNSs during their formation processes.

 - **Abstract**
 We simulate the formation of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) cores in the presence of a Black Hole (BH) to explore whether BHs can serve as seeds for FDM core condensation. Our analysis is based on the core-condensation via the kinetic relaxation process for random initial conditions of the FDM. We show that in general the BH merges with pre-collapsed mini-clusters and once they share location the BH oscillates within the core. The condensation takes place around the black hole and the FDM acquires a density profile consistent with the density of the stationary solution of the FDM+BH eigenvalue problem in average. The central density of the resulting core depends on the mass of the BH, which due to its motion relative to the FDM cloud produces a smaller time-averaged densities for bigger BH masses, which lead to a new diversity of central FDM core densities. Our results indicate that BHs can indeed act as focal points for FDM core condensation. As a collateral result, for our analysis we revised the construction of stationary solutions of FDM+BH and found a phenomenological formula for the FDM density that can be used to fit FDM cores around BHs.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background (CGWB) anisotropies contain valuable information about the physics of the early universe. Given that General Relativity is intrinsically nonlinear, it is important to look beyond first-order contributions in cosmological perturbations. In this work, we present a non-perturbative approach for the computation of CGWB anisotropies at large scales, providing the extension of the initial conditions and the Sachs-Wolfe effect for the CGWB, which encodes the full non-linearity of the scalar metric perturbations. We also derive the non-perturbative expression for three-point correlation of the gravitational wave energy density perturbation in the case of an inflationary CGWB with a scale-invariant power spectrum and negligible primordial non-Gaussianity. We show that, under such conditions, the gravitational wave energy density perturbations are lognormally distributed, leading to an interesting effect such as intermittency.

          Cosmic chronometers, Pantheon+ supernovae, and quasars favor coasting cosmologies over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model

 - **Abstract**
 We test and compare coasting cosmological models with curvature parameters ${k=\left\{ -1,0,+1 \right\}}$ in ${H_0^2 c^{-2}}$ units and the flat $\Lambda$CDM model by fitting them to cosmic chronometers (CC), the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernovae (SNe), and standardized quasars (QSOs). We used the \texttt{emcee} code for fitting CC data, a custom Markov Chain Monte Carlo implementation for SNe and QSOs, and Anderson-Darling tests for normality on normalized residuals for model comparison. Best-fit parameters are presented, constrained by data within redshift ranges $z\leq 2$ for CCs, $z\leq 2.3$ for SNe, and $z\leq 7.54$ for QSOs. Coasting models, particularly the flat coasting model, are generally favored over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model. The overfitting of the flat $\Lambda$CDM model to Pantheon+ SNe and the large intrinsic scatter in QSO data suggest a need to refine error estimates in these datasets. We also highlight the seemingly fine-tuned nature of either the CC data or $\Omega_{\mathrm{m},0}$ in the flat $\Lambda$CDM model to an ${H_1=H_0}$ coincidence when fitting ${H(z)=H_1z+H_0}$, a natural feature of coasting models.

 - **Abstract**
 The availability of accurate and timely state predictions for objects in near-Earth orbits is becoming increasingly important due to the growing congestion in key orbital regimes. The Two-line Element Set (TLE) catalogue remains, to this day, one of the few publicly-available, comprehensive sources of near-Earth object ephemerides. At the same time, TLEs are affected by measurement noise and are limited by the low accuracy of the SGP4 theory, introducing significant uncertainty into state predictions. Previous literature has shown that filtering TLEs with batch least squares methods can yield significant improvements in long-term state prediction accuracy. However, this process can be highly sensitive to TLE quality which can vary throughout the year. In this study, it is shown that either extended-duration fit windows of the order of months, or the removal of systematic biases in along-track position prior to state estimation can produce significant reductions in post-fit position errors. Simple models for estimating these systematic biases are shown to be effective without introducing the need for high-complexity Machine Learning (ML) models. Furthermore, by establishing a TLE-based error metric, the need for high accuracy ephemerides is removed when creating these models. For selected satellites in the Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) regime, post-fit position errors are reduced by up to 80 %, from approximately 5 km to 1 km; meanwhile, for selected satellites in the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO)/Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GSO) regime, large oscillations in post-fit position error can be suppressed.

 - **Abstract**
 The BL Lacertae object VER J0521+211 underwent a notable flaring episode in February 2020. A short-term monitoring campaign, led by the MAGIC (Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov) collaboration, covering a wide energy range from radio to very-high-energy (VHE, 100 GeV < E < 100 TeV) gamma rays was organised to study its evolution. These observations resulted in a consistent detection of the source over six consecutive nights in the VHE gamma-ray domain. Combining these nightly observations with an extensive set of multiwavelength data made modelling of the blazar's spectral energy distribution (SED) possible during the flare. This modelling was performed with a focus on two plausible emission mechanisms: i) a leptonic two-zone synchrotron-self-Compton scenario, and ii) a lepto-hadronic one-zone scenario. Both models effectively replicated the observed SED from radio to the VHE gamma-ray band. Furthermore, by introducing a set of evolving parameters, both models were successful in reproducing the evolution of the fluxes measured in different bands throughout the observing campaign. Notably, the lepto-hadronic model predicts enhanced photon and neutrino fluxes at ultra-high energies (E > 100 TeV). While the photon component, generated via decay of neutral pions, is not directly observable as it is subject to intense pair production (and therefore extinction) through interactions with the cosmic microwave background photons, neutrino detectors (e.g. IceCube) can probe the predicted neutrino component. Finally, the analysis of the gamma-ray spectra, as observed by MAGIC and the Fermi-LAT telescopes, yielded a conservative 95\% confidence upper limit of z \leq 0.244 for the redshift of this blazar.

          Impact of reionization history on constraining primordial gravitational waves in future all-sky cosmic microwave background experiments

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the impact of the reionization history on examining the shape of the power spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization. The large-scale CMB generated from the reionization epoch is important in probing the PGWs from all-sky experiments, such as LiteBIRD. The reionization model has been constrained by several astrophysical observations. However, its uncertainty could impact constraining models of the PGWs if we use large-scale CMB polarization. Here, by expanding the analysis of Mortonson & Hu (2007), we estimate how reionization uncertainty impacts constraints on a generic primordial tensor power spectrum. We assume that CMB polarization is measured by a LiteBIRD-like experiment and the tanh model is adopted for a theoretical template when we fit data. We show that constraints are almost unchanged even if the true reionization history is described by an exponential model, where all parameters are within 68% Confidence Level (CL). We also show an example of the reionization history that the constraints on the PGWs are biased more than 68% CL. Even in that case, using E-mode power spectrum on large scales would exclude such a scenario and make the PGW constraints robust against the reionization uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The Galactic ASKAP collaboration (GASKAP) is undertaking an HI emission survey of the 21cm line to map the Magellanic system and the Galactic plane with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). One of the first areas observed in the Pilot Phase I of the survey was the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Previous surveys of the SMC have uncovered new structures in the periphery of the SMC, along relatively low column density lines of sight. Aims. In this work we aimed to uncover the phase distribution of three distinct structures in the periphery of the SMC. This work will add to the constraints we have on the existence and survival of the cold neutral medium (CNM) in the SMC. Methods. We used ROHSA, a Gaussian decomposition algorithm, to model the emission across each cloud and classify the HI emission into their respective phases based on the linewidths of the fitted Gaussians. We created maps of velocity and column density of each phase of the HI across these three clouds. We measured the HI mass and CNM number density for each cloud. We also compared the HI results across the different phases with other gas tracers. Results. We find that in two clouds, the ends of each cloud are almost completely CNM dominated. Analysis of these two clouds indicates they are experiencing a compressive force from the direction of the SMC main body. In the third cloud we find a uniform CNM distribution along one wall of what is likely a supershell structure. Comparison with previous measurements of CO clumps in two of the clouds show the CO and HI are co-moving within a few km/s in regions of high HI column density, particularly when considering just the CNM.

 We investigate the evolution of initial fractal clusters at 3 kpc from the Galactic Center (GC) of the Milky Way and show how red supergiant clusters (RSGCs)-like objects, which are considered to be the result of active star formation in the Scutum complex, can form by 16 Myr. We find that initial tidal filling and tidal over-filling fractals are shredded by the tidal force, but some substructures can survive as individual subclusters, especially when the initial virial ratio is $\leq$this http URL surviving subclusters are weakly mass segregated and show a top-heavy mass function. This implies the possibility that a single substructured star cluster can evolve into multiple `star clusters'.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrometric measurements provide a unique avenue for constraining the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). In this work, we investigate the application of two neural network architectures, a fully connected network and a graph neural network, for analyzing astrometric data to detect the SGWB. Specifically, we generate mock Gaia astrometric measurements of the proper motions of sources and train two networks to predict the energy density of the SGWB, $\Omega_\text{GW}$. We evaluate the performance of both models under varying input datasets to assess their robustness across different configurations. Our results demonstrate that neural networks can effectively measure the SGWB, showing promise as tools for addressing systematic uncertainties and modeling limitations that pose challenges for traditional likelihood-based methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Machine learning (ML) methods have become popular for parameter inference in cosmology, although their reliance on specific training data can cause difficulties when applied across different data sets. By reproducing and testing networks previously used in the field, and applied to 21cmFast and Simfast21 simulations, we show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often learn to identify features of individual simulation boxes rather than the underlying physics, limiting their applicability to real observations. We examine the prediction of the neutral fraction and astrophysical parameters from 21 cm maps and find that networks typically fail to generalise to unseen simulations. We explore a number of case studies to highlight factors that improve or degrade network performance. These results emphasise the responsibility on users to ensure ML models are applied correctly in 21 cm cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed time-resolved and phase-resolved polarimetric analysis of the transient X-ray pulsar RX J0440.9+4431/LS V +44 17, using data from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) during the 2023 giant outburst. We conducted a time-resolved analysis by dividing the data into several intervals for each observation. This analysis reveals a continuous rotation of the phase-averaged polarization angle (PA) across the observations performed during the super-critical and sub-critical regimes. To investigate the origin of the PA rotation, we performed a pulse phase-resolved polarimetric analysis over four time intervals, each spanning approximately three days. Applying the rotating vector model (RVM), the geometric parameters of the system were determined for each interval. Despite the short time gap of just $\sim$ 20 days, we observed significant variation in the RVM parameters between the first interval and the subsequent three, indicating the presence of an additional polarized component alongside the RVM component. Using a two-polarized component model with the assumption that this additional component remains constant across pulse phases, we calculated the phase-averaged PA and polarized flux of both the variable and constant components. The phase-averaged PA of each component remained relatively stable over time, but the polarized flux of the constant component decreased, while that of the variable component increased. The observed rotation of the PA is attributed to the gradual shift in the polarized flux ratio between the two components and is not directly related to the different accretion regimes.

          Two-Part Interplanetary Type II Solar Radio Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 Two similar-looking, two-part interplanetary type II burst events from 2003 and 2012 are reported and analysed. The 2012 event was observed from three different viewing angles, enabling comparisons between the spacecraft data. In these two events, a diffuse wide-band type II radio burst was followed by a type II burst that showed emission at the fundamental and harmonic (F-H) plasma frequencies, and these emission bands were also slightly curved in their frequency-time evolution. Both events were associated with high-speed, halo-type coronal mass ejections (CMEs). In both events, the diffuse type II burst was most probably created by a bow shock at the leading front of the CME. However, for the later-appearing F-H type II burst there are at least two possible explanations. In the 2003 event there is evidence of CME interaction with a streamer, with a possible shift from a bow shock to a CME flank shock. In the 2012 event a separate white-light shock front was observed at lower heights, and it could have acted as the driver of the F-H type II burst. There is also some speculation on the existence of two separate CMEs, launched from the same active region, close in time. The reason for the diffuse type II burst being visible only from one viewing direction (STEREO-A), and the ending of the diffuse emission before the F-H type II burst appears, still need explanations.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae constitute a unique laboratory for particle physics and astrophysics. They are powerful neutrino sources of all flavors, emitting essentially all the gravitational binding energy through neutrinos, at the end of their life. I will highlight how crucial is the observation of the next core-collapse supernova and of the diffuse supernova neutrino background, whose discovery might be imminent.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pierre Auger Observatory has detected downward terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) with its Surface Detector. A key to understanding this high-energy radiation in thunderstorms is to combine such measurements with measurements of lightning processes in their earliest stages. With eleven modified Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) stations we can build an interferometric lightning detection array working in the bandwidth between 30 - 80 MHz inside the Surface Detector array to precisely measure lightning stepped leaders in 3D. These measurements allow us to decipher the cause of TGFs and clarify the reason for the observed high-energy particles in thunderstorms. We will present the current status of the detection plans including the configuration of the interferometric lightning detection array and the steps to take as well as the reconstruction characteristics obtained with AERA.

 - **Abstract**
 We have detected three new hydrogen-deficient (H < 0.001 mass fraction) pre-white dwarfs (WDs) with helium-dominated atmospheres. The first object is a relatively cool PG1159 star (effective temperature Teff = 72,000 K) that has the lowest surface gravity of any PG1159 star known (log g = 4.8). It is a PG1159 star in the earliest pre-WD phase. The second object is a hot subdwarf O (sdO) star (Teff = 50,000 K, log g = 5.3) with high carbon and oxygen abundances. It is only the third known member of the recently established CO-sdO spectral class, which comprises stars that are thought to be formed by a merger of a disrupted low-mass CO WD with a higher-mass He WD. The third object is one of the rare stars of spectral type O(He) (Teff = 90,000 K, log g = 5.5).

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the possibility that the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background suggested by Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) datasets is sourced by Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). Specifically, we perform a Bayesian search in the International PTA Data Release 2 (IPTA DR2) for a combined GW background arising from scalar perturbations and unresolved PBH mergers, assuming a broad PBH mass distribution. In our analysis, we incorporate constraints on the curvature power spectrum from CMB $\mu$-distortions and the overproduction of PBHs, which significantly suppress the contribution of PBH mergers to the total GW background. We find that scalar-induced GWs dominate the nHz frequency range, while PBH mergers alone cannot account for the observed signal under the standard PBH formation scenario involving Gaussian perturbations, and including only Poissonian PBH clustering. However, specific PBH models, such as those with enhanced clustering, could yield a GW background dominated by PBH mergers. Overall, we find that the IPTA DR2 strongly favors an astrophysical origin for the reported common-spectrum process over the PBH models considered in this analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent measurements of the galaxy 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) have seemingly detected non-zero parity-odd modes at high significance. Since gravity, the primary driver of galaxy formation and evolution is parity-even, any parity violation, if genuine, is likely to have been produced by some new parity-violating mechanism in the early Universe. Here we investigate an inflationary model with a Chern-Simons interaction between an axion and a $U(1)$ gauge field, where the axion itself is the inflaton field. Evaluating the trispectrum (Fourier-space analog of the 4PCF) of the primordial curvature perturbations is an involved calculation with very high-dimensional loop integrals. We demonstrate how to simplify these integrals and perform all angular integrations analytically by reducing the integrals to convolutions and exploiting the Convolution Theorem. This leaves us with low-dimensional radial integrals that are much more amenable to efficient numerical evaluation. This paper is the first in a series in which we will use these results to compute the full late-time 4PCF for axion inflation, thence enabling constraints from upcoming 3D spectroscopic surveys such as Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), Euclid, or Roman.

 - **Abstract**
 The fact that the standard dispersion relation for photons in vacuum could be modified because of their interaction with the quantum nature of spacetime has been proposed more than two decades ago. A quantitative model [Jacob \& Piran, JCAP 01, 031 (2008)], has been tested extensively using distant highly energetic astrophysical sources, searching for energy-dependent time delays in photon arrival times. Since no delay was firmly measured, lower limits were set on the energy scale $\Lambda$ related to these effects. In recent years, however, different but equally well-grounded expressions beyond the Jacob \& Piran model were obtained for the photon dispersion relation, leading to different expressions for the dependence of lag versus redshift. This article introduces a general parameterization of modified dispersion relations in cosmological symmetry, which directly leads to a general parameterized lag versus redshift dependence encompassing both existing and new models. This parameterization could be used in the future to compare the predicted time lags of the different models and test them against observations. To investigate this possibility, realistic data sets are simulated, mimicking different types of extragalactic sources as detected by current and future instruments. When no lag is injected in the simulated data, each lag-redshift model leads, as expected, to a different value for the limit on $\Lambda$, and the Jacob \& Piran model gives the most stringent bound. When a lag at $\Lambda \sim E_P$ in the Jacob \& Piran model is injected, it is detected for all the other lag-redshift relations considered, although leading to different values. Finally, the possibility to discriminate between several lag-redshift models is investigated, emphasizing the importance of an evenly distributed sample of sources across a wide range of redshifts.
