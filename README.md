 - **Abstract**
 Networks of ground stations designed to transmit and receive at optical wavelengths through the atmosphere offer an opportunity to provide on-demand, high-bandwidth, secure communications with spacecraft in Earth orbit and beyond. This work describes the operation and activities of current Free Space Optical Communication (FSOC) ground stations in Germany and Australasia. In Germany, FSOC facilities are located at the Oberpfaffenhofen campus of the Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Aerospace Center, DLR), the Laser-Bodenstation in Trauen (Responsive Space Cluster Competence Center, DLR), and the Research Center Space of the University of the Bundeswehr Munich in Neubiberg. The DLR also operates a ground station in Almeria, Spain as part of the European Optical Nucleus Network. The Australasian Optical Ground Station Network (AOGSN) is a proposed network of 0.5 -- 0.7m class optical telescopes located across Australia and New Zealand. The development and progress for each node of the AOGSN is reported, along with optimisation of future site locations based on cloud cover analysis.

 Policy Brief on "Workforce Development in Astronomy and Astroinformatics", distilled from the corresponding panel that was part of the discussions during S20 Policy Webinar on Astroinformatics for Sustainable Development held on 6-7 July 2023. The discipline of astronomy and astroinformatics is dynamically evolving thereby creating a compelling opportunity to foster a more inclusive, diverse, and proficient workforce. This is crucial for addressing multifaceted challenges that emerge as we progress and harness the potential therein. To realize this goal, it's imperative to cultivate strategies that promote inclusive practices in STEM education, encourage participation from historically excluded groups, provide training and mentorship, as well as provide active champions, especially for students and early career professionals from (historically) excluded groups. We provide an overview of the current status, resources available, and possible steps especially keeping in mind large international projects. The policy webinar took place during the G20 presidency in India (2023). A summary based on the seven panels can be found here: arxiv:2401.04623.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the outcomes of the regular announcements of observing opportunities for ESA's gamma-ray observatory INTEGRAL issued between 2000 and 2021. We investigate how success rates vary with the lead proposer's gender, academic age and the country where the proposer's institute is located. The more than 20 years operational lifetime enable the evolution of the community proposing for INTEGRAL to be probed. We determine proposal success rates for high-priority and all proposals using both the numbers of accepted proposals and the amounts of awarded observing time. We find that male lead proposers are between 2--11\% more successful than their female counterparts in obtaining INTEGRAL observations. We investigate potential correlations between the female-led proposal success rates and the amount of female participation in the Time Allocation Committee.

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST/NIRSpec integral field data of the quasar PJ308-21 at $z=6.2342$. As shown by previous ALMA and HST imaging, the quasar has two companion sources, interacting with the quasar host galaxy. The high-resolution G395H/290LP NIRSpec spectrum covers the $2.87-5.27\ \rm \mu m$ wavelength range and shows the rest-frame optical emission of the quasar with exquisite quality ($S/N\sim 100-400$ per spectral element). Based on the H$\beta$ line from the broad line region, we obtain an estimate of the black hole mass $M_{\rm BH,H\beta}\sim 2.7\times 10^{9}\ \rm M_{\odot}$. This value is within a factor $\lesssim 1.5$ of the H$\alpha$-based black hole mass from the same spectrum ($M_{\rm BH, H\alpha}\sim 1.93\times 10^{9}\ \rm M_{\odot}$) and is consistent with a previous estimate relying on the MgII $\lambda 2799$ ($M_{\rm BH, MgII}\sim 2.65\times 10^{9}\ \rm M_{\odot}$). All these $M_{\rm BH}$ are within the $\sim 0.5$ dex intrinsic scatter of the adopted mass calibrations. The high Eddington ratio of PJ308-21 $\lambda_{\rm Edd,H\beta}\sim 0.67$ ($\lambda_{\rm Edd,H\alpha}\sim 0.96$) is in line with the overall quasar population at $z \gtrsim 6$. The relative strengths of the [OIII], FeII and H$\beta$ lines are consistent with the empirical "Eigenvector 1" correlations as observed for low redshift quasars. We find evidence for blueshifted [OIII] $\lambda 5007$ emission with a velocity offset $\Delta v_{\rm [OIII]}=-1922\pm 39$ km s$^{-1}$ from the systemic velocity and a $\rm FWHM([OIII])=2776^{+75}_{-74}$ km s$^{-1}$. This may be the signature of an outflow from the nuclear region, despite the true values of $\Delta v_{\rm [OIII]}$ and $\rm FWHM([OIII])$ are likely more uncertain due to the blending with H$\beta$ and FeII lines. Our study demonstrates the unique capabilities of NIRSpec in capturing quasar spectra at cosmic dawn and studying their properties in unprecedented detail.

 - **Abstract**
 The radio galaxy M87 is a variable very-high energy (VHE) gamma-ray source, exhibiting three major flares reported in 2005, 2008, and 2010. Despite extensive studies, the origin of the VHE gamma-ray emission is yet to be understood. In this study, we investigate the VHE gamma-ray spectrum of M87 during states of high gamma-ray activity, utilizing 20.2$\,$ hours the H.E.S.S. observations. Our findings indicate a preference for a curved spectrum, characterized by a log-parabola model with extra-galactic background light (EBL) model above 0.3$\,$TeV at the 4$\sigma$ level, compared to a power-law spectrum with EBL. We investigate the degeneracy between the absorption feature and the EBL normalization and derive upper limits on EBL models mainly sensitive in the wavelength range 12.4$\,$$\mu$m - 40$\,$$\mu$m.

 - **Abstract**
 We present time-series linear-polarization observations of the bright O4 supergiant $\zeta$ Puppis. The star is found to show polarization variation on timescales of around an hour and longer. Many of the observations were obtained contemporaneously with Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry. We find that the polarization varies on similar timescales to those seen in the TESS light-curve. The previously reported 1.78-day photometric periodicity is seen in both the TESS and polarization data. The amplitude ratio of photometry to polarization is ~9 for the periodic component and the polarization variation is oriented along position angle ~70 deg-160 deg. Higher-frequency stochastic variability is also seen in both datasets with an amplitude ratio of ~19 and no preferred direction. We model the polarization expected for a rotating star with bright photospheric spots and find that models that fit the photometric variation produce too little polarization variation to explain the observations. We suggest that the variable polarization is more likely the result of scattering from the wind, with corotating interaction regions producing the periodic variation and a clumpy outflow producing the stochastic component. The H$\alpha$ emission line strength was seen to increase by 10% in 2021 with subsequent observations showing a return to the pre-2018 level.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to understand the relationship between planet multiplicity, mass, and composition, we present newly measured masses of five planets in two planetary systems: Kepler-323 and Kepler-104. We used the HIRES instrument at the W.M. Keck Observatory to collect 79 new radial velocity measurements (RVs) for Kepler-323, which we combined with 48 literature RVs from TNG/HARPS-N. We also conducted a reanalysis of the Kepler-104 system, using 44 previously published RV measurements. Kepler-323 b and c have masses of $2.0^{+1.2}_{-1.1}$ M$_\oplus$ and 6.5$\pm1.6$ M$_\oplus$, respectively, whereas the three Kepler-104 planets are more massive (10.0$\pm2.8$ M$_\oplus$, $7.1^{+3.8}_{-3.5}$ M$_\oplus$, and $5.5^{+4.6}_{-3.5}$ M$_\oplus$ for planets b, c, and d, respectively). The Kepler-104 planets have densities consistent with rocky cores overlaid with gaseous envelopes ($4.1^{+1.2}_{-1.1}$ g/cc, $2.9^{+1.7}_{-1.5}$ g/cc, and $1.6^{+1.5}_{-1.1}$ g/cc respectively), whereas the Kepler-323 planets are consistent with having rocky compositions ($4.5^{+2.8}_{-2.4}$ g/cc and $9.9^{+2.7}_{-2.5}$ g/cc). The Kepler-104 system has among the lowest values for gap complexity ($\mathcal{C}$ = 0.004) and mass partitioning ($\mathcal{Q}$ = 0.03); whereas, the Kepler-323 planets have a mass partitioning similar to that of the Inner Solar System ($\mathcal{Q}$ = 0.28 and $\mathcal{Q}$ = 0.24, respectively). For both exoplanet systems, the uncertainty in the mass partitioning is affected equally by (1) individual mass errors of the planets and (2) the possible existence of undetected low-mass planets, meaning that both improved mass characterization and improved sensitivity to low-mass planets in these systems would better elucidate the mass distribution among the planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Detailed studies of hot subdwarf B stars with red dwarf or brown dwarf companions can shed light on the effects of binarity on late stellar evolution. Such systems exhibit a strong, quasi-sinusoidal reflection effect due to irradiation of the cool companion, and some even show primary and secondary eclipses. Here we compute Fourier transforms of TESS light curves of sdB+dM/BD binaries and investigate correlations between the relative amplitudes and phases of their harmonics and system parameters. We show that the reflection effect shape strongly depends on the orbital inclination, with nearly face-on systems having much more sinusoidal shapes than nearly edge-on systems. This information is encoded by the relative strength of the first harmonic in the Fourier transform. By comparing observations of solved systems to synthetic light curves generated by LCURVE, we find that the inclination of non-eclipsing systems with high S/N light curves can be determined to within ~10 degrees simply by measuring their orbital periods and first harmonic strengths. We also discover a slight asymmetry in the reflection effect shape of sdB+dM/BD binaries using the relative phase of the first harmonic. From our analysis of synthetic light curves, we conclude the asymmetry results from relativistic beaming of both stellar components. This marks the first time Doppler beaming has been detected in sdB+dM/BD systems. Although advanced modeling is necessary to quantify the effects of secondary parameters like limb darkening, the temperature ratio, and the radius ratio on the reflection effect shape, our pilot study demonstrates that it might be possible to extract both the inclination angle and cool companion velocity from the light curves of non-eclipsing systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the second NuSTAR and XMM-Newton extragalactic survey of the JWST North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Time-Domain Field (TDF). The first NuSTAR NEP-TDF survey (Zhao et al. 2021) had 681 ks total exposure time executed in NuSTAR cycle 5, in 2019 and 2020. This second survey, acquired from 2020 to 2022 in cycle 6, adds 880 ks of NuSTAR exposure time. The overall NuSTAR NEP-TDF survey is the most sensitive NuSTAR extragalactic survey to date, and a total of 60 sources were detected above the 95% reliability threshold. We constrain the hard X-ray number counts, logN-log S, down to 1.7 x 10$^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at 8-24 keV and detect an excess of hard X-ray sources at the faint end. About 47% of the NuSTAR-detected sources are heavily obscured (NH > 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$), and 18+20% of the NuSTAR-detected sources are Compton-thick (N>10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$). These fractions are consistent with those measured in other NuSTAR surveys. Four sources presented >2$\sigma$ variability in the 3-year survey. In addition to NuSTAR, a total of 62 ks of XMM-Newton observations were taken during NuSTAR cycle 6. The XMM-Newton observations provide soft X-ray (0.5-10keV) coverage in the same field and enable more robust identification of the visible and infrared counterparts of the NuSTAR-detected sources. A total of 286 soft X-ray sources were detected, out of which 214 XMM-Newton sources have secure counterparts from multiwavelength catalogs.
#### Period-Luminosity-Metallicity-Color Relations of Late-type Contact  Binaries in the Big Data Era

 - **Abstract**
 Binary stars ubiquitous throughout the universe are important. Contact binaries (CBs) possessing Period-Luminosity (PL) relations could be adopted as distance tracers. The PL relations of CBs are influenced by metallicity abundance and color index, which are connected to both the radius and luminosity of stars. Here we propose fine relations of Period-Luminosity-Metallicity-Color (PLZC) from the ultraviolet to infrared bands based on current surveys. The accuracy of the distance estimation is 6\% and 8\%, respectively, depending on the PLZC relations of the CBs in the infrared and optical bands of the collected data. PLZC models are still more accurate than PLC models in determining intrinsic luminosity, notwithstanding their limited improvement. Meanwhile, these relations based on synthetic photometry are also calibrated. On the basis of the synthetic photometry, a 6\% accuracy of distance is estimated. The measured or synthetic data of PLZC or PLC relations in infrared bands comes first in the list of suggestions for distance estimations, and is followed by the measured data of optical bands.

 - **Abstract**
 Existence of strongly bound water molecules on silicate surfaces, above the desorption temperature of water ice, has been first predicted by computational studies and recently demonstrated by laboratory experiments. Such trapped water may be present in various astrophysical environments and there is now evidence for its presence in the diffuse interstellar medium and in extraterrestrial particles. We present here new results of a laboratory study of the phenomenon of trapping (strong bonding) of water molecules by silicates. We show that the efficiency of trapping is strongly dependent on the properties and composition of the surface. Our results point out that the presence of trapped water should be due to the hydrophilic properties of the silicate surface and that the nature of trapping is physical (physisorption rather than chemisorption). We demonstrate that water can be trapped on silicates up to the temperatures of about 470 K, which speaks for the presence of wet silicate grains in the terrestrial planet formation zone in planet-forming disks. Studying the thermal and UV stability of trapped water, we conclude that the detection of trapped water in the diffuse ISM speaks for its efficient continuous formation. We discuss our results as relevant to fundamental scientific questions, such as the oxygen depletion problem, the origin of water on Earth, and the formation of rocky planets.

 - **Abstract**
 The polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation carries essential information on early stages of the Universe such as the cosmic inflation, forming cosmological structures through gravitational lensing, and the epoch of re-ionization. The signal requires high sensitivity instruments with a large number of detectors (bolometers) and low leakage of Stokes $I$ into $Q$ and $U$. The Galactic diffuse foreground emission is a limiting factor in CMB polarization measurements, requiring its characterization at both low and high frequency compared to the peak of the CMB emission, in order to be subtracted off. In this paper we describe the next generation space experiment for the measure of the CMB polarization, LiteBIRD, that is aimed to investigate the first fractions of a second of the Universe and is expected to be flown at the beginning of the next decade. Also, we describe the experiments designed for measuring the foreground emissions from our own Galaxy. Finally, we also describe sub-orbital experiments, operating and planned, as they are vehicles for the development of technologies and data reduction tools that have been and will be used in space missions.

 - **Abstract**
 The transit method allows the detection and characterization of planetary systems by analyzing stellar light curves. Convolutional neural networks appear to offer a viable solution for automating these analyses. In this research, two 1D convolutional neural network models, which work with simulated light curves in which transit-like signals were injected, are presented. One model operates on complete light curves and estimates the orbital period, and the other one operates on phase-folded light curves and estimates the semimajor axis of the orbit and the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio. Both models were tested on real data from TESS light curves with confirmed planets to ensure that they are able to work with real data. The results obtained show that 1D CNNs are able to characterize transiting exoplanets from their host star's detrended light curve and, furthermore, reducing both the required time and computational costs compared with the current detection and characterization algorithms.

 - **Abstract**
 The mass loss experienced on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) at the end of the lives of low- and intermediate-mass stars is widely accepted to rely on radiation pressure acting on dust grains formed in the extended AGB atmospheres. The interaction of convection, stellar pulsation, and heating and cooling processes cause the density, velocity and temperature distributions in the inner regions of the envelope to be complex, making the dust-formation process difficult to calculate. Hence, characterising the extended atmospheres and inner outflow empirically is paramount to advance our understanding of the dust-formation and wind-driving processes. To this end, we observe the AGB star R Dor using ALMA and modelled the $^{12}$CO $v=0, J=2-1$, $v=1, J=2-1$ and $3-2$ and $^{13}$CO $v=0, J=3-2$ lines using the 3D radiative transfer code LIME up to a distance of $\sim 4$ times the radius of the star at sub-mm wavelengths. We find a complex velocity field with structure down to scales at least equal to the resolution of the observations. The observed maps are well reproduced assuming spherical symmetry for the gas temperature and density distributions. We find the radial profiles of these two quantities to be very steep close to the star and shallower for radii larger than $\sim 1.6$ times the stellar sub-mm radius. This change is consistent with the transition between extended atmosphere and outflow. We constrain the standard deviation of the stochastic velocity distribution in the large-scale outflow to be $\lesssim 0.4$ km/s. We observe two emission blobs in the CO $v=0, J=2-1$ line and find their gas densities and radial velocities to be substantially larger than those of the surrounding gas. Monitoring the evolution of these blobs will lead to a better understanding of the role of these structures in the mass-loss process of R Dor.
#### The effect of lightning on the atmospheric chemistry of exoplanets and  potential biosignatures

 - **Abstract**
 Lightning has been suggested to play a role in triggering the occurrence of bio-ready chemical species. Future missions (PLATO, ARIEL, HWO, LIFE) and ground-based ELTs will investigate the atmospheres of potentially habitable exoplanets. We aim to study the effect of lightning on the atmospheric chemistry, how it affects false-positive and false-negative biosignatures, and if its effect would be observable on an exo-Earth and on TRAPPIST-1 planets. We use a combination of laboratory experiments, photochemical and radiative transfer modelling. With spark discharge experiments in N2-CO2-H2 gas mixtures, representing a range of possible rocky-planet atmospheres, we investigate the production of potential lightning signatures (CO, NO), possible biosignature gases (N2O, NH3, CH4), and important prebiotic precursors (HCN, Urea). Photochemical simulations are conducted for oxygen-rich and anoxic atmospheres for rocky planets in the habitable zones of the Sun and TRAPPIST-1 for a range of lightning flash rates. Synthetic spectra are calculated using SMART to study the atmosphere's reflectance, emission, and transmission spectra. Lightning enhances the spectral features of NO, NO2, and, in some cases, CO; CH4 and C2H6 may be enhanced indirectly. Lightning at a flash rate slightly higher than on modern Earth can mask the ozone features of an oxygen-rich, biotic atmosphere, making it harder to detect the biosphere. Lightning flash rates at least ten times higher than on modern Earth can mask the presence of ozone in the anoxic, abiotic atmosphere of a planet orbiting a late M dwarf, reducing the potential for a false-positive life-detection. The threshold lightning rates to eliminate oxygen and ozone false positive biosignatures on planets orbiting ultra-cool dwarfs is up to ten times higher than the modern flash rate, suggesting that lightning cannot always prevent these false-positive scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 The impact of formation flying on interferometry is growing over the years for the potential performance it could offer. However, it is still an open field, and many studies are still required. This article presents the basic principles behind interferometry focusing first on a single array and secondly on a formation of satellites. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to evaluate how the performance of the interferometry is affected by an error in the relative position in the formation geometry. This is estimated by computing the loss of the performance in terms of percentage deviation due to a non-nominal relative trajectory, including two-dimensional errors and defining a payload index. The main goal of this study is to estimate whether some errors in the relative state are more impacting than others. The final objective is to compute the link between a position error and a specific loss of performance, to foresee the origin of the the error. Furthermore, a dynamical model is developed to describe the relative motion in the Low Earth Orbit environment, considering both the unperturbed and the J2 and drag contributions. A Proportional, Integral and Derivative controller is implemented for the position control of a multiple satellite formation flying, considering a low thrust control profile. The Formation Flying L-band Aperture Synthesis study is taken as the case scenario, analysing both nominal and non-nominal configurations. This study serves as a starting point for the development of a combined tool to assess the performance of the interferometry and the control on the relative state for future remote sensing studies involving relative motion.

 The Center for Underground Physics of the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) in Korea has been planning the construction of a deep underground laboratory since 2013 to search for extremely rare interactions such as dark matter and neutrinos. In September 2022, a new underground laboratory, Yemilab, was finally completed in Jeongseon, Gangwon Province, with a depth of 1,000 m and an exclusive experimental area spanning 3,000 m$^3$. The tunnel is encased in limestone and accommodates 17 independent experimental spaces. Over two years, from 2023 to 2024, the Yangyang Underground Laboratory facilities will be relocated to Yemilab. Preparations are underway for the AMoRE-II, a neutrinoless double beta decay experiment, scheduled to begin in Q2 2024 at Yemilab. Additionally, Yemilab includes a cylindrical pit with a volume of approximately 6,300 m$^3$, designed as a multipurpose laboratory for next-generation experiments involving neutrinos, dark matter, and related research. This article provides a focused overview of the construction and structure of Yemilab.

 - **Abstract**
 The determination of the covariance matrix and its inverse, the precision matrix, is critical in the statistical analysis of cosmological measurements. The covariance matrix is typically estimated with a limited number of simulations at great computational cost before inversion into the precision matrix; therefore, it can be ill-conditioned and overly noisy when the sample size $n$ used for estimation is not much larger than the data vector dimension. In this work, we consider a class of methods known as shrinkage estimation for the precision matrix, which combines an empirical estimate with a target that is either analytical or stochastic. These methods include linear and non-linear shrinkage applied to the covariance matrix (the latter represented by the so-called NERCOME estimator), and the direct linear shrinkage estimation of the precision matrix which we introduce in a cosmological setting. Using Bayesian parameter inference as well as metrics like matrix loss functions and the eigenvalue spectrum, we compare their performance against the standard sample estimator with varying sample size $n$. We have found the shrinkage estimators to significantly improve the posterior distribution at low $n$, especially for the linear shrinkage estimators either inverted from the covariance matrix or applied directly to the precision matrix, with an empirical target constructed from the sample estimate. Our results should be particularly relevant to the analyses of Stage-IV spectroscopic galaxy surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and Euclid, whose statistical power can be limited by the computational cost of obtaining an accurate precision matrix estimate.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio frequency interference (RFI) have been an enduring concern in radio astronomy, particularly for the observations of pulsars which require high timing precision and data sensitivity. In most works of the literature, RFI mitigation has been formulated as a detection task that consists of localizing possible RFI in dynamic spectra. This strategy inevitably leads to a potential loss of information since parts of the signal identified as possibly RFI-corrupted are generally not considered in the subsequent data processing pipeline. Conversely, this work proposes to tackle RFI mitigation as a joint detection and restoration that allows parts of the dynamic spectrum affected by RFI to be not only identified but also recovered. The proposed supervised method relies on a deep convolutional network whose architecture inherits the performance reached by a recent yet popular image-denoising network. To train this network, a whole simulation framework is built to generate large data sets according to physics-inspired and statistical models of the pulsar signals and of the RFI. The relevance of the proposed approach is quantitatively assessed by conducting extensive experiments. In particular, the results show that the restored dynamic spectra are sufficiently reliable to estimate pulsar times-of-arrivals with an accuracy close to the one that would be obtained from RFI-free signals.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a multi-wavelength Pro-Am campaign to study the behaviour of flares from the active M1.5V star binary CR Draconis. CR Dra was observed with TESS 20-s photometry, Swift near-UV (NUV) grism spectroscopy and with ground-based optical photometry and spectroscopy from a global collaboration of amateur astronomers. We detected 14 flares with TESS and Swift simultaneously, one of which also had simultaneous ground-based photometry and spectroscopy. We used the simultaneous two-colour optical and NUV observations to characterise the temperature evolution of the flare and test the accuracy of using optical data to predict NUV emission. We measured a peak temperature of $7100^{+150}_{-130}$ K for this flare, cooler than the typically assumed 9000 K blackbody model used by flare studies. We also found that the 9000 K blackbody overestimated the NUV flux for other flares in our sample, which we attributed to our Swift observations occurring during flare decays, highlighting the phase-dependence for the accuracy of flare models.

 - **Abstract**
 Using higher-order statistics to capture cosmological information from weak lensing surveys often requires a transformation of observed shear to a measurement of the convergence signal. This inverse problem is complicated by noise and boundary effects, and various reconstruction methods have been developed to implement the process. Here we evaluate the retention of signal information of four such methods: Kaiser-Squires, Wiener filter, $\texttt{DarkMappy}$, and $\texttt{DeepMass}$. We use the higher order statistics $\textit{Minkowski functionals}$ to determine which method best reconstructs the original convergence with efficiency and precision. We find $\texttt{DeepMass}$ produces the tightest constraints on cosmological parameters, while Kaiser-Squires, Wiener filter, and $\texttt{DarkMappy}$ are similar at a smoothing scale of 3.5 arcmin. We also study the MF inaccuracy caused by inappropriate training sets in the $\texttt{DeepMass}$ method and find it to be large compared to the errors, underlining the importance of selecting appropriate training cosmologies.

 - **Abstract**
 Much of the information gleaned from observations of star-forming regions comes from the analysis of their molecular emission spectra, particularly in the radio regime. The time-consuming nature of fitting synthetic spectra to observations interactively for such line-rich sources, however, often results in such analysis being limited to data extracted from a single-dish observation or a handful of pixels from an interferometric observation. Yet, star-forming regions display a wide variety of physical conditions that are difficult, if not impossible, to accurately characterize with such a limited number of spectra. We have developed an automated fitting routine that visits every pixel in the field of view of an ALMA data cube and determines the best-fit physical parameters, including excitation temperature and column densities, for a given list of molecules. In this proof-of-concept work, we provide an overview of the fitting routine and apply it to 0".26, 1.1 km s$^{-1}$ resolution ALMA observations of two sites of massive star-formation in NGC 6334I. Parameters were found for 21 distinct molecules by generating synthetic spectra across 7.48 GHz of spectral bandwidth between 280 and 351 GHz. Spatial images of the derived parameters for each of the > 8000 pixels are presented with special attention paid to the C$_2$H$_4$O$_2$ isomers and their relative variations. We highlight the greater scientific utility of the column density and velocity images of individual molecules compared to traditional moment maps of single transitions.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the realization of R-symmetric Higgs inflation within the framework of no-scale-like supergravity, aiming to elucidate the formation of primordial black holes and observable gravitational waves within a class of GUT models. We explore the possibility of an ultra-slow-roll phase in a hybrid inflation framework, where the GUT Higgs field primarily takes on the role of the inflaton. The amplification of the scalar power spectrum gives rise to scalar-induced gravitational waves and the generation of primordial black holes. The predicted stochastic gravitational wave background falls within the sensitivity range of existing and upcoming gravitational wave detectors, while primordial black holes hold the potential to explain the abundance of dark matter. Furthermore, we highlight the significance of the leading-order nonrenormalizable term in the superpotential of achieving inflationary observables consistent with the latest experimental data. Additionally, the predicted range of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, a key measure of primordial gravitational waves, lies within the observational window of future experiments searching for B-mode polarization patterns in cosmic microwave background data.
#### Planetary atmospheres Through Time: Effects of Mass Loss and Thermal  Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric mass loss is a fundamental phenomenon shaping the structure and evolution of planetary atmospheres. It can engage processes ranging from global interactions with the host star and large-scale hydrodynamic outflows to essentially microphysical kinetic effects. The relevance of these processes is expected to change between planets of different properties and at different stages in planetary and stellar evolution. The early evolution of planetary atmospheres, as well as atmospheric escape from close-in planets hosting hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, is thought to be driven by thermal hydrodynamic escape, while the kinetic non-thermal effects are most relevant for the long-term evolution of planets with secondary atmospheres, similar to the inner planets in the Solar System. The relative input of different mechanisms, hence, the mass loss rate, shows a complicated dependence on planetary parameters and the parameters of the host star, where the latter evolve strongly with time. It results in a large variety of possible evolution paths of planetary atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 Ground-based high-resolution spectra provide a powerful tool for characterising exoplanet atmospheres. However, they are greatly hampered by the dominating telluric and stellar lines, which need to be removed prior to any analysis. Such removal techniques ("preparing pipelines") deform the spectrum, hence a key point is to account for this process in the forward models used in retrievals. We develop a formal derivation on how to prepare froward models for retrievals, in the case where the telluric and instrumental deformations can be represented as a matrix multiplied element-wise with the data. We also introduce the notion of "Bias Pipeline Metric" (BPM), that can be used to compare the bias potential of preparing pipelines. We use the resulting framework to retrieve simulated observations of 1-D and 3-D exoplanet atmospheres and to re-analyse high-resolution ($\mathcal{R} \approx 80\,400$) near infrared (0.96--1.71 $\mu$m) CARMENES transit data of HD~189733~b. We compare these results with those obtained from a CCF analysis. With our fiducial retrieval, we find a blueshift of the absorption features of $-5.51^{+0.66}_{-0.53}$ km$\cdot$s$^{-1}$. In addition, we retrieve a H$_2$O $\log_{10}$(VMR) of $-2.39^{+0.12}_{-0.16}$ and a temperature of $660^{+6}_{-11}$ K. We are also able to put upper limits for the abundances of CH$_4$, CO, H$_2$S, HCN and NH$_3$, consistent with a sub-solar metallicity atmosphere enriched in H$_2$O. We retrieve a broadened line shape, consistent with rotation- and wind-induced line broadening. Finally, we find a lower limit for the pressure of an opaque cloud consistent with a clear atmosphere, and find no evidence for hazes.

 - **Abstract**
 There exist very few mid-infrared (IR) observations of supernovae (SNe) in general. Therefore, SN 1987A, the closest visible SN in 400 years, gives us the opportunity to explore the mid-IR properties of SNe, the dust in their ejecta and surrounding medium, and to witness the birth of a SN remnant (SNR). The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its high spatial resolution and extreme sensitivity, gives a new view on these issues. We report on the first imaging observations obtained with the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI). We build temperature maps and discuss the morphology of the nascent SNR. Our results show that the temperatures in the equatorial ring (ER) are quite non-uniform. This could be due to dust destruction in some parts of the ring, as had been assumed in some previous works. We show that the IR emission extends beyond the ER, illustrating the fact that the shock wave has now passed through this ring to affect the circumstellar medium on a larger scale. Finally, while sub-mm Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations have hinted at the location of the compact remnant of SN 1987A, we note that our MIRI data have found no such evidence.
